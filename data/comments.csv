Covid-19 deaths may have been overestimated, Hiqa report finds
Leo Varadkar said the findings are “interesting but not a surprise” because of how deaths related to the virus are counted.
Jul 3rd 2020, 9:31 AM 69,256 130
Updated Jul 3rd 2020, 2:13 PM
THERE WAS A 13% increase in deaths in Ireland between March and June but Covid-19 deaths may have been overestimated, a new report by the Health Information and Quality Authority (Hiqa) has found.
The report examined the number of excess deaths that occurred over a three-month period during the Covid-19 pandemic.
The document, which can be read here, assessed the number of deaths that occurred in Ireland from 11 March to 16 June, relative to the expected number of deaths, using data from the death notices website RIP.ie.
It found that the official number of Covid-19 deaths reported may be an overestimate – something Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said was “not a surprise” given how deaths related to the virus are counted.
There were about 1,100 to 1,200 more deaths than would be expected based on historical patterns – a 13% increase between 11 March and 16 June, the report notes.
Excess deaths peaked by 33% over a six-week period from 25 March to 5 May. During this period, there was an increase of 1,200 deaths from expected figures, with 1,332 Covid-19-related deaths officially reported.
‘Interesting but not a surprise’
ADVERTISEMENT
Hiqa’s Chief Scientist, Dr Conor Teljeur, said the analysis shows “clear evidence of excess deaths occurring since the first reported death due to Covid-19 in Ireland”.
“However, the number of excess deaths is substantially less than the reported 1,709 Covid-19-related deaths over the same period.”
Hiqa found that the official number of reported Covid-19 deaths likely “overestimates the true burden of excess deaths caused by the virus”.
The report states that this could be due to the inclusion within official figures of people who were infected with the virus at the time of death whose cause of death may have been predominantly due to other factors.
Speaking to RTÉ’s News at One, Teljeur said the official figure of 1,709 is likely “an accurate estimate”.
“It may be a slight overestimate, but it is likely to be an accurate estimate. Excess mortality, it has a limitation that doesn’t necessarily fully state the burden of Covid-19 on mortality.
“So excess mortality is trying to contrast the number of deaths that were observed with the number that were expected. And as some of these people were expected to have died during that period, then they don’t count towards the excess mortality.

5513,3344,270,"@JusticeForJoe: The Clare TD was questioning Interim Director of Ireland’s Health Protection Surveillance Centre Dr. John Cuddihy about the current system of recording Covid cases and deaths in Ireland, when it was acknowledged by the doctor that if patients die because of a heart attack, stroke or other ailment, but are found to have tested positive for Covid-19, they will be recorded as a Covid-19 death as per the World Health Organization guidelines.
“If somebody who is asymptomatic…and they have a heart attack and are brought to hospital and are tested…and they die soon thereafter…are they recorded as a Covid death or not?” McNamara asked. “If they have tested positive for Covid but ultimately came to hospital because they’ve had a heart attack or a stroke, or fallen off the roof of a building or something like that?”
Responding to the TD, Dr. Cuddihy said, “[W]e adhere to the World Health Organization case definition in terms of the recording and reporting of deaths. So in the situation that you describe, where someone has a positive Covid test, then it is a death in a confirmed Covid case, but such a case would be subject to a coroner’s report as well, and as part of the ongoing validation of the data in Ireland’s surveillance system, we would take additional details in relation…”
Interjecting. McNamara said a coroner’s report takes a very long time to make its way through the system, prompting Cuddihy to confirm that a deceased person may be taken off the list of Covid-19 deaths at a later date following that report.
McNamara also asked Dr. Cuddihy about whether someone hospitalized with “a broken leg”, but then tested and found to be a positive in hospital, would be counted among the Covid-19 hospitalization numbers, to which the director of Ireland’s Health Protection Surveillance Centre said “they are included in the surveillance statistics, yeah.”
Dr. Cuddihy’s explanation of how deaths are being counted is consistent with official reports in July that Ireland’s death-toll from Covid-19 was overestimated.",17,9277877,9277682,"2hours ago"

97 people died from Flu during the 32 week long 2018/2019 flu season, and 110 flu related deaths were reported in the most recent 2019/2020 flu season, that began on Oct 1 2019.
However, since April, Flu has almost disappeared e.g. of 375 people tested in the last 4 weeks, no one tested positive for Flu viruses. And no one was admitted to hospital with Flu in the last 4 weeks. This is due to the lockdown, flu is less contagious than SARS-COV-2, as many people have pre-existing immunity to Flu and there’s a vaccine. Flu is a lot easier to suppress.
Globally Flu is way down, it decreased by about 98% in the US.
“Data from clinical laboratories in the United States indicated a 61% decrease in the number of specimens submitted (from a median of 49,696 per week during September 29, 2019–February 29, 2020, to 19,537 during March 1–May 16, 2020) and a 98% decrease in influenza activity as measured by percentage of submitted specimens testing positive (from a median of 19.34% to 0.33%).”

5646,3420,276,"So let’s look at this report in context. Firstly, What would they consider to be “Excessive Force”?
To the Officers dealing with a violent and aggressive prisoner, they may deem the force used was appropriate to gain control of a prisoner that his posing a danger to them or others. While the CPT, who were not involved in the altercation may deem it to be excessive. It comes down to a matter of opinion.
Secondly they selected a mentality ill prisoner as a case study.
The first thing the reader should notice was that the Officers would only open the door to the cell when protected by a shield. This should inform the reader that this Prisoner was extremely dangerous, extremely violent, and must have had a history of assaulting Officers.
As in every work place “Worker Safety” is by Law, paramount to any other considerations. And this is no different in our Prisons. Officer safety has, does and always must supercede prisoner welfare. Prison Officers are not trained Psychiatric Nurses. Their first duty is to protect themselves and any attached psychiatric from the Central Mental Hospital when dealing with dangerous and psychotic prisoners.
The question of this prisoner having a shower may have been moot if (a) the prisoner refused one or (b) the potential of violence and injury to the Prison Staff and also potential injury to the prisoner himself may have outweighed the benefits of allowing this prisoner out of the cell and into the shower.
Neither is dealt with by this report.",120,9277513,9277513,"4hours ago"

It is also disingenuous for Bacik to baldly assert that the people left it to the legislature to decide this matter. She well knows the mischief the people voted to remedy when they overwhelmingly passed the referendum.
The amendment was approved by a large plurality. The idea that it would or should be reversed and subverted by mere legislation is beyond arrogance.

Another referendum would have the same outcome.

Removing automatic citizenship means there will be stateless people. Of course not an issue for you if you don’t have to experience it.
But our decision as Irish people means other people will have to experience that. It will mean people will be deported to places where they know no one and possibly don’t even speak the language. Everybody deserves to right to a passport and the right to be counted as a person.
When we hear individual stories (a 9 year old in Bray etc.) we are generally sympathetic and start local campaigns to protect the rights of those individuals. It’s the general rule we have an issue with, as it’s easier to group people together by whatever measure we use (“foreigners”, skin colour, etc.). We find it easier to count a group of unknown people together as “others” than we do an individual. Just take a look at successful “GoFundMe” pages.
The “Yes” side campaigned in 2004 that the amendment was to protect heavily pregnant women who shouldn’t be traveling in their condition to have a baby here. There were cases of that happening, but vanishingly few. That argument was simply putting a nice spin on it. That voting “Yes” to the amendment was showing how much we care for these people.
In a poll taken after that referendum in 2004, 76% of respondents who voted “Yes” said they voted that way because they felt there were already too many immigrants in Ireland or that immigrants had already taken too many jobs in this country.
One can argue that those reasons are not racist, but arguing that people born to Irish citizens deserve more rights than others, or that “we should take care of our own first” is describing racism. Who is “our own”?
I’m not even going to bother denouncing racism. It’s just I’d like people to be more honest about their reasons for voting a certain way. Only then can we really think honestly and validly about why we vote that way.",5,9277889,9277889,"2hours ago"

There is no more risk in a traditional pub of spreading the so called virus (please show me where you get this proof) as there is in a restaurant. If they thought for one minute there was they would stop the sale of alcohol in restaurants.
It is very obvious that none of these people have been in a pub for a long time, pubs have changed in the last 10 years. It is ok for 30 kids in a classroom, it is ok for 30 players on a pitch etc, but it is not ok for 4 friends to have a quiet drink in a corner. It is time this government got real. What they are actually saying is, people that go to traditional pubs are working class & cannot control themselves, so they must do it for them. What an insult.
It makes absolutely no sense to open a restaurant & not a pub, but the only reason I can think of is that they themselves need somewhere to go & would not be going to a pub to mix with the working class.

6315,3797,308,"It happened last week, in Italy: a girl, primary school teacher, send intimate images of herself to her boyfriend.
They broke up after a while. Boyfriend send those pics to his football buddies, for a laugh. One of the lads showed pic to his wife. Wife recognize her as teacher of the kids. Went to the principal, and the principal sacked the teacher.
Eventually she decides to report everything to the police.
- boyfriend sentenced to 5 yrs, according to the recent law called: “porn revenge”
- boyfriend’s friend got lighter sentence for shoving and circulating the pic
- principal got sentenced for unlawful dismissal
- teacher got money as repair damage, but… will be hard to get her life back

An average life sentence in Ireland ranges ~17 to 22 years. ~98% are men.
Is posting such pictures of someone without consent ethnically and morally repugnant act, absolutely it is.

6321,3798,308,"@Sorcha Ní Shúilleabháin: Yes, which is why it is vital you don’t introduce these idealogue laws with prison sentences that are completely open to serious abuse.
As a person accused by a potentially irate former partner after a toxic break up how do you prove verbal consent or perhaps a person simply genuinely misinterpreted a non verbal gesture.
It becomes one persons word versus another.
Its nothing like a burglary/shoplifting where you can have cctv etc an eye witness, DNA, fingerprints etc which all help ensure totally innocent people are not convicted and the guilty people are.
In my opinion it’s a very dangerous path trying to implement such toxic idealogue laws, you leave the door wide open for serious abuse to what is just as morally wrong which is “revenge accusers”",29,9276757,9276644,"20hours ago"
