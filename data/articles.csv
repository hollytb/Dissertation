258,179,"Pandemic Unemployment Payment to remain open to new applications until 31 March 2020",https://www.thejournal.ie/pup-to-remain-open-new-applications-31-march-5277321-Nov2020/,"THE PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT Payment (PUP) will remain open to new applicants until 31 March 2021. 
Following a government decision in September, the PUP was due to close to new applications on 31 December. However, Social Protection Minister Heather Humphreys secured government approval today to extend it until the end of March next year. 
The extension of the closing date will ensure workers can still access the PUP in January in the event that their employment ceases after Christmas.
To date, over €4.3 billion has been paid out under the PUP to hundreds of thousands of people who lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic. 
“By keeping the PUP scheme open to new applicants until 31 March 2021, we are providing certainty to employees who may be returning to work in the run-up to the Christmas period,” Humphreys said. 
“I have listened to the retail and hospitality sector and I know they have had concerns that closing PUP to new entrants on 31 December, as originally planned, would act as a disincentive to take up work,” she said. 
“Workers can be reassured that if they have to reapply for PUP in January, February or March, they will have an entitlement to the payment.” 
The Minister has also secured government approval to extend the waiver on waiting days for jobseeker payments until the end of March 2021. 
Ordinarily, when a person makes an application for jobseeker’s benefit or allowance, payment is not made for the first three days of unemployment. These are called waiting days. 
These waiting days will continue to be waived on applications for jobseekers’ payments until the end of March 2021. 
“In line with keeping the PUP scheme open for applications, I am also extending the waiver on the waiting days for jobseekers’ payments. This will ensure that individuals who get temporary work between now and the end of March, and who lose their jobs can claim a jobseekers’ payment and receive their income support immediately,” Humphreys said.

Elsewhere, FLAC chief executive Eilis Barry has written to members of the Oireachtas to express concern at the provisions of Section 3 of the Finance Bill 2020 which proposes to retrospectively impose a tax liability on claims for the PUP. 
In her correspondence with TDs and senators, Barry enclosed a legal opinion, prepared by FLAC’s legal team, in relation to the legislation which is at report stage in the Dáil on 2 December before consideration of the Bill begins in the Seanad on 9 December. 
FLAC’s managing solicitor said: “FLAC’s analysis suggests that the retrospective provisions of Section 3 of the 2020 Bill may create a tax liability which is unexpected and which disproportionately affects those who have suffered the most financial hardship as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
“The proposed provisions may not accord with the constitutional protection of citizens’ property rights. The introduction of retrospective legislation which interferes with those rights is only constitutionally permissible in certain limited circumstances and these circumstances do not seem to apply to the current situation.” 
Barry added that it is FLAC’s hope that its “significant concerns in relation to this legislation will be addressed as it progresses through the Oireachtas in the coming weeks”.

The taking, distribution or publication of intimate images without consent, and without a requirement that the person intended to cause harm to the victim shall will carry a maximum penalty of a €5,000 fine and/or a 12 months jail sentence.
Justice Minister Helen McEntee today said she hopes the legislation will be passed by the end of the year.
When the practice is illegal, it puts an obligation on online platforms to remove such content, McEntee said, adding that there has been “a grey area” around that to date.
The move comes a few days after the gardaí confirmed they are investigating the uploading of images and videos of Irish women and girls, without their consent, to a number of online forums.
The Victims Alliance, an advocacy group, said tens of thousands of images have been shared on various online platforms. The group is working to identify the victims but said many of them are Irish.
Some of the images and videos in question were taken by the victims and privately shared but were later publicly shared without their consent or knowledge.
Some images or footage were taken of people surreptitiously and without their knowledge, and others were taken from online platforms such as OnlyFans, Tinder, WhatsApp and Instagram.
It is understood the fact that the person may have consented to the taking of an image will be irrelevant if it is subsequently published or distributed without their consent.
The Bill does not specify the types of technology that may be used to commit the offences, and is intentionally neutral to cover all forms of online and offline communications that cause harm to a victim.
It will also be an aggravating factor for the purposes of sentencing if the perpetrator of the offence is or was in an intimate relationship with the victim of the offence.

The new measures will be contained in amendments to the Harassment, Harmful Communications and other Related Offences Bill.
The legislation was first proposed by Labour in May 2017, but it was not passed prior to the dissolution of the last government.
Speaking to TheJournal.ie today, Labour’s Brendan Howlin said he has for years tried to get the government see the issue as a priority.
Asked why he felt it fell on deaf ears under the last Dáil, he said: “They just never embraced it as a priority, that’s it.”
When McEntee took office, Howlin said he sought a meeting with her, and told her that his party’s Bill needed to be progressed. She agreed, said the Wexford TD.
“The day has come, but is has been a long time coming,” he said.
He said the legislation around dealing with harrassment of this kind has not been updated for decades, stating that the current legislation mentions technology should has telephones and texting.

Howlin said it is a “hidden harm going on online”, but that “events over the last week has jolted the realisation” that it needs to be dealt with urgently.
He pointed out that when the UK brought in similar legislation, the Crown Prosecution saw around 200 prosecutions per year.

Father-of-two Colin Hoey (30) was today jailed for 21 days and fined €2,000 for contempt of court. Hoey, with an address at O’Neill Estate, Cregganduff, Co Armagh, pleaded guilty to the charge after failing to appear to answer a witness order during the trial of Aaron Brady.
Hoey had initially provided an alibi for Aaron Brady but later retracted it.
Justice Michael White said this morning that he was sure threats issued to Hoey and his family in advance of the Brady trial had been taken “quite seriously” by them. He noted that Hoey was a “very decent young man” from a “very decent family” who had been caught up in a “very difficult situation”.
A bench warrant was issued for Hoey by trial judge Mr Justice White on 5 March this year and he was arrested by gardaí on 5 October after presenting himself at the Criminal Courts of Justice. The High Court has heard that the offence is punishable by imprisonment, fine or both.
Aaron Brady was found guilty of the murder of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe by an 11 to one majority jury verdict at the Central Criminal Court on 11 August.
Last month, the 29-year-old with a last address at New Road, Crossmaglen, Co Armagh was sentenced to the mandatory term for murder of life imprisonment with a minimum time served of 40 years. Brady was also sentenced to 14 years for the robbery of €7,000 – a sentence that will run concurrently with the life sentence – at Lordship Credit Union in Bellurgen, Co Louth on 25 January 2013.
During hearings at Brady’s trial, Detective Inspector Mark Phillips of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation said that Hoey was a witness of “some significance” who had provided an alibi for Aaron Brady but had later withdrawn that alibi.
At today’s contempt hearing in the High Court, Remy Farrell SC, for Hoey, told Mr Justice White that the charge of contempt against his client was admitted.
Taking the witness stand, Detective Inspector Phillips told prosecution counsel Brendan Grehan SC that Hoey had “significant evidence” to give at Brady’s trial if he had attended.

Under cross-examination, Detective Inspector Phillips agreed with Farrell that “certain elements” had made contact with Hoey and his father in advance of Brady’s trial and “these elements” had intimated that it might not be in Hoey’s best interest to attend Brady’s trial.
Farrell put it to the witness that whatever was said had certainly caused Hoey and his family to take the view that these were “implicit threats” backed by criminal or paramilitary elements. “I’m not party to the conversation that took place but ultimately he did not appear to give evidence,” replied Detective Inspector Phillips.
At a brief hearing last month, Detective Garda Padraic O’Reilly testified that Hoey was informed on 3 March 2020 that he was required to attend the Criminal Courts of Justice the following day to give evidence in the Brady trial and if he did not show up a bench warrant would be issued. However, the witness did not attend court on 4 March and a bench warrant was issued by trial judge Mr Justice White on 5 March. Attempts were made by gardaí to execute the warrant after this date, the High Court was told.
However, solicitor Danny McNamee, for Hoey, made contact with gardaí in early October and informed them that his client wished to present himself for the execution of the warrant. Hoey presented himself at the Criminal Courts of Justice on 5 October and the warrant was executed.

262,179,"Retailers call on government to move forward re-opening of sector to Monday",https://www.thejournal.ie/retail-excellence-reopening-lockdown-5277136-Nov2020/,"RETAIL EXCELLENCE, THE largest body for the industry in Ireland, has set out three “key demands” for the government in advance of the anticipated reopening of non-essential retail next week. 
Cabinet is meeting today to discuss the Level 5 exit plan as all indications are the country will be moving back to Level 3 restrictions, with some modifications, come next Tuesday. 
Yesterday, Micheál Martin said that “no decisions have been made as yet” as to exactly what restrictions will follow Level 5.
However, it appears there will be good news for retailers, with all non-essential shops set to reopen. 
It is understood that retailers will also be given the green light to extend opening hours. While such a move usually requires planning permission, it is believed local authorities have been doing a lot of work with businesses to facilitate the longer opening hours. 
This is to mitigate crowds of shoppers descending on retailers in the weeks up to Christmas.
In a statement today, Retail Excellence set out three “key demands” for government in advance of the lifting of Level 5 restrictions. Current regulations are in place until 2 December, just after midnight.
The key demands are: 
The reopening of non-essential retail to be brought forward to Monday, 30 November at the latest.
Easing of national restrictions to enable shoppers to cross county lines and to accommodate indoor dining in coffee shops, cafes and restaurants. 
Retailers to be allowed to extend trading hours as needed for December. 
“This is the most critical week of the year for retailers, and we simply cannot afford to get the big decisions wrong around reopening non-essential retail,” Retail Excellence managing director Duncan Graham said. 
He also called on the government to ease restrictions from Monday so that shoppers could travel across county boundaries and also ensure coffee shops and cafes could facilitate indoor dining.

“If shoppers cannot leave their own county, this will have a hugely negative effect on retailers who depend on this business,” Graham said. 
“At the same time, any level of restrictions above two would mean coffee shops and cafes could only facilitate outdoor dining for 15 people maximum, which would be devastating for businesses and act as a deterrent for shoppers in the coming weeks, especially given the bad December weather,” he said. 
Graham has also called on the government and local authorities to allow for longer trading hours through December to adequately deal with shopper demand. 
As noted above, it is understood that retailers will be given the green light to extend opening hours. 
“Retailers have done everything they can to mitigate the risks posed by Covid-19, and an extension of opening hours would mean they could effectively deal with customer demand for Christmas. It makes sense in every respect,” Graham said. 
He also called on the Irish people to support Irish businesses this Christmas.

The 32-year-old former Celtic striker and Republic of Ireland star, who is from Dublin, claims he acted in self-defence.
He was charged in April with accused of assault causing harm to a named man at Fitzgerald’s pub on Aston Quay, in Dublin 2, on 16 March 2019, which he denies.
The charge is under section three of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act.
He was due to to appear again at Dublin District Court today to have a hearing date set. However, neither the player nor his lawyer were there.
Judge Colin Daly was told the defendant has remained in regular contact with Garda Donal O’Neill, the prosecuting officer. A long adjournment was required for the hearing because the alleged injured party lived in the UK and was not willing to travel.
Judge Daly noted the accused and his lawyer were not before the court and he acceded to an application to issue a bench warrant for his arrest.
Stokes, who has an address at Wyckham Point, in Dundrum, Dublin 14, “made no reply to the charge”, the court heard on 28 April last. Disclosure of evidence to the defence has been ordered.
The Director of Public Prosecutions has directed summary disposal meaning the case should stay in the district court and not go to the circuit court which has tougher sentencing powers.
Jurisdiction was accepted.
In an outline of the evidence given earlier, Garda O’Neill said it was alleged Stokes headbutted the complainant once, “knocking him to the ground and temporarily losing consciousness”.
However, the man did not suffer lasting injuries, the court was told.

On conviction, the district court can impose a 12-month sentence for the offence.
Stokes denies the charge. On the night in question, he had been at the bar with his girlfriend “and says he acted at all times in self-defence, proportionately”, his solicitor had said at a previous hearing.
The footballer had been ordered to abide by bail conditions.
He had to continue living at his current residence in Ireland and notify gardai if he obtains work outside the State, and provide the address as well as name of the employer.

Each year, parties must disclose to Sipo any donations that exceeded €1,500 or aggregated donations from the same donor that exceeded that same value. 
The maximum amount that may be accepted from the same donor in the same year is €2,500.
The report by the state’s ethics watchdog for last year shows that donations disclosed by Irish political parties last year totalled €175,576.
Of that figure, Fine Gael disclosed the largest amount at €79,456, followed by Sinn Féin at €45,620 and the Labour Party at €21,800. 
Fianna Fáil’s declared donations totalled just €2,500, despite the party winning the largest number of seats in last year’s local council elections.
Donation statements submitted to Sipo by the parties show that elected TDs from most parties disclosed donations, but the single declared donation to Fianna Fail is from the estate of Michael Fahy. 
According to Sipo, there were a total of 22 parties registered to contest elections in 2019.

The Sipo report also contains details of ‘accounting units’ within parties, which are subsidiaries that receive donations above €100. Within those units, Sipo states that the balance held by them collectively is €950,112. 
The report states that Fine Gael has the largest number of such units at 39 while Sinn Féin have just eight.

His estate has been estimated at up to €4.6 million and Sinn Féin says the donation is in line with rules laid down by the Northern Ireland Electoral Commission. 
Other parties have said that Sinn Féin is exploiting a “loophole” and it should return the money above the €2,500 Sipo limit.

Deadlines for submitting donation returns fall in March and this year occurred during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Sipo says that this meant that some parties submitted returns after the legal deadline but that it remains satisfied that parties “made best efforts” to submit them in time.
As a result, Sipo says it will not recommendation any action against the parties for late submissions. ","Donations disclosed by Irish political parties last year totalled €175,576.",21,0,0,18948,"2 hours ago"

A miracle some may say; something the Cork woman believes in.

But it’s been a difficult few weeks since the Girls In Green’s bitterly disappointing, and quite simply heartbreaking, 1-0 defeat to Ukraine, a hammer blow towards their qualification hopes.
When asked whether it was the toughest night of her colourful career, O’Sullivan doesn’t mince her words.
“Yeah, honestly it was,” she says, later adding that there were plenty of tears in the hours and days that followed.
“It was absolutely devastating. I didn’t get over it for honestly a few weeks later. I went back to Brighton and was just so down.
“It was the most upsetting part of my career, losing that game, to be totally honest. Look, those things make you stronger. You have to take the positives out of it. We weren’t bad on the night. Things just didn’t go our way.
“It’s football. Those nights happen a lot in football. We need to pick ourselves up again. We’ve come back into this camp and we’re very positive. We’re still second in the table and that’s a positive. Here we are for a huge game and we’re just excited to get out there and play.”
But the Knocknaheeny native, on loan at Brighton & Hove Albion from US side North Carolina Courage, says it’s been set aside — and Vera Pauw’s side are ready to face Germany, where they will indeed need a miracle of some sort, to put it plainly.
“After a few weeks you just have to [park it] really because you have another big game coming up. You can’t think about the past any more. I’m past it now and I’ve moved forward, I think we all have and we’ll just move on to the next game.

“Look, we have to be realistic. Germany are one of the best teams in the world. We’ve seen last time against them at home how good they were and how tough the game was. We’ll have a game-plan, work hard and go out and do our best and hopefully get three points.”
Thankfully, 26-year-old O’Sullivan is a firm believer in miracles — unsurprising considering she was part of the U17 side that beat the same opposition 1-0 in 2010, the senior outfit that went so close against them in 2014, and one that secured a famous 0-0 draw against Netherlands three years ago.

The odds are, again, certainly stacked against them next Tuesday night at Tallaght Stadium, but Ireland will cling on to any bit of hope as they face the world’s second-ranked nation and eight-time European champions, who boast a 100% record in this campaign, scoring 37 goals and conceding zero.
“Anything can happen,” O’Sullivan assures, unsure if the visitors will mix and match their squad, though Ireland will give it all and play whatever is in front of them. “It’s 11 versus 11 and being realistic, Germany are out of this world. But as I said anything can happen.”
Likewise, a Ukrainian slip-up against group minnows Montenegro is unlikely, but it can’t be written off. Anything can happen in sport, after all.
Away from the international scene, O’Sullivan has been plying her trade at Brighton in the Women’s Super League [WSL] alongside Irish team-mates Megan Connolly and Rianna Jarrett; a temporary move closer to home to ensure availability for Ireland amidst Covid-19 restrictions, made even more interesting by the arrival of several US World Cup winners to the league.
“I’ve been really enjoying it. It’s a challenge and I love challenging myself. Having the two Irish girls helps me settle in and the club have welcomed me with open arms. It’s a tough league as you can see with all the players coming in from around the world.

“It made life easier having the two girls there, Megan has been my friend since I was 15 when we played with each other and against each other. I have got to know Rianna very well since she came into the Irish set-up.
“Living with them is great, Rianna cooks me dinner every night so it’s going really well!”
But having sealed her security Stateside as one of Courage’s protected players ahead of a recent Draft, O’Sullivan remains under contract there and will return ahead of the new season (the NSWL recently announced plans for a Challenge Cup in April ahead of a May 2021 season start).
“I’m very excited to be going back, they’re a world-class team. The environment is world-class and you’re only become a better player being in that arena. Paul [Riley] is one of the best coaches in the world and I’ve learned so much.
“It will be a long season with the pandemic, we will have a tournament and the regular season so there is a lot to look forward to.”

267,185,"Holly Cairns: The greyhound industry is inherently cruel – so why should the taxpayer fund it?",https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/greyhound-racing-animal-welfare-5276198-Nov2020/,"IN THE SPACE of two days last week, the Government took a somewhat contradictory approach to animal welfare in this country.
On one hand, the Taoiseach pledged State support for Dublin Zoo and Fota Wildlife Park, both of which are facing an urgent financial crisis due to Covid-19 restrictions.
At the same time, the Government was pushing through a motion, without debate, to increase funding for an industry where serious animal welfare issues have been exposed and continue to cause concern.
In 2021, greyhound racing in Ireland will benefit to the tune of €19.2m from the public purse – an increase of €2.4m. This is despite a significant drop in the numbers attending race meetings and declining advertising revenues. 
Phenomenal financial support
The industry has received approximately €280m in taxpayer funding since 2000. As turnover from racing activities has steadily declined over the last decade (€32.9m in 2010 to €22.7m in 2017), State funding has increased from €11.9m in 2010 to €16.8m in 2020.
To put it bluntly, the greyhound industry has become a financial basket case and is being kept alive by generous State subventions each year. The Irish Greyhound Board/Greyhound Racing Ireland has not delivered a dividend to the taxpayer in the past 25 years – and is unlikely to do so in the future.
Attendance at greyhound racing meetings fell by 55 per cent between 2008 and 2018 and the combined loss for tracks between 2019 and 2022 is predicted to be €30 million. A 2019 Red C poll found that only 16 per cent of the Irish population agree that the Government should continue to fund the industry.
This is hardly surprising. In the same year, a harrowing ‘RTÉ Investigates’ programme laid bare the horrific treatment of greyhounds by some of those involved in the sport. This is an industry where 16,000 greyhounds are bred each year – 1,000 per cent more than are needed.
Of these, 6,000 are culled for spurious reasons, ranging from a decline in performance to not being fast enough to compete on the track.
While it must be acknowledged that many breeders treat their dogs well, some of those of operating in the shadowy fringes of the industry have carried out acts of unspeakable cruelty to animals.
There have been cases where dogs had their ears cut off to avoid their registered owners being traced; of exported greyhounds enduring 15-hour journeys to the UK in the most appalling conditions; and blatant breaches of regulations by some unscrupulous operators of knackeries, with healthy dogs shot in the head and disposed of for as little as €20.

The overarching appalling standards of care make it difficult to understand the justification for continued State funding. In contributing millions of euros of public money to greyhound racing every year, the Government is propping up an inherently cruel sport which the Irish public has been increasingly rejecting. It is unconscionable and cannot be allowed to continue.
An unwelcome industry in 2020
It is true that improvements have been made in funding for animal care relating to the greyhound industry. However, this was only committed to after significant public pressure in the wake of the 2019 RTÉ investigation. 
Tomorrow, the Social Democrats will bring a Private Members’ Motion on this issue before the Dáil. We are calling on the Government to waive the increased funding of €2.4m due to be given to the greyhound industry.
Instead, it should incrementally refocus greyhound racing funding to the welfare of dogs impacted by the industry. There are many cash-strapped animal welfare organisations dedicated to the care and rehoming of greyhounds that could benefit instead.
We also believe that the Government should work towards the gradual phasing out of State support for Irish greyhound racing by 2025. This would allow for a reasonable transition period for a sunset industry that no longer enjoys significant public support.
In the middle of a pandemic, when there isn’t money available for things like domestic violence refuge spaces or disability support services, the Government not only continues to fund greyhound racing but increases the level of funding for the sector.
Our motion seeks to demonstrate our clear commitment to animal welfare. The taxpayer should not be complicit in the Government’s efforts to paper over the cracks of a failing industry where greyhounds are treated as livestock and cruelty is endemic.

There was a brief discussion of the planned lifting at today’s Cabinet meeting. The country will be moving back to Level 3 restrictions, with some modifications, come next Wednesday.
While there had been speculation that the public announcement might be made on Thursday, so as not to clash with the Late Late Toy Show, the working plan as of now is the government is planning to make details known on Friday.
The National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) will meet on Wednesday, with government waiting to see the final data before making a final call on the level of restrictions over the Christmas period. 
The current restrictions are due to last until a minute after midnight on 2 December, with non-essential retail due to open on that date, along with hairdressers, barbers and gyms. 
It is understood that retailers will also be given the green light to extend opening hours.
While such a move usually requires planning permission, it is believed local authorities have been doing a lot of work with businesses to facilitate the longer opening hours.
Sport such as tennis and gold will also reopen next week.
Travel
Inter-county travel will be restricted until later in the month, but the 5km guidance will be lifted in the earlier phase. 
The household visits advice may not be lifted next week, but is expected to remain in place until later in December. 
In terms of restrictions on household visits, it is believed restrictions could be lifted for Christmas week, with the focus more on personal choice and responsibility, rather than rigid recommendations on numbers.
Guidance around lifting travel restrictions will come in around the 20 or 21 December, but it’s not fully decided upon yet.
However, the public will be asked to limit mingling to perhaps one main gathering during the Christmas period.
The main battleground for the government is whether pubs and restaurants will reopen for December.

There is doubt in government circles that wet pubs will be given the green light to open their doors.
While no final decisions have been made yet, it is understood that in order to allow restaurants and pubs that serve food to open, one option under consideration is delaying their reopening by one week from 1 December. 
Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said all sectors will be given advance warning ahead of reopening. He said the government has been using data analytics, in conjunction with NPHET. 
“Data will inform next steps,” said Martin, adding: “It is not guess work.”
Some of the measures due to be announced “will be palatable, some of it will not”, he said.
The Taoiseach said Ireland is the second best in Europe in terms of keeping the virus down. “Will someone acknowledge that?” he asked.
He said the series of restrictions and the hard work of the Irish people achieved it, stating that it came “at a cost, a big cost”.

The NPWS said it has visited the scene and will issue further comment in due course. 
In Ireland, seals are a protected species under the Irish Wildlife Act, 1976 and The EU’s Marine Mammal Protection Act, 1972. 
One woman told Radio Kerry that she discovered a number of dead seals on Banna Beach that appeared to have been “beheaded”.
With many species in decline, our colleagues at Noteworthy want to find out if the Government is adequately protecting our natural world? Support this project here. 
She said she was concerned about the frequency in which she was discovering seal carcases in the last two weeks.
“I’ve just been on my walk and come across it on a number of occasions over a short space of time, and that strikes as there’s something else going on,” she said. 
“The heads of the seals seemed to have been removed. The first time that I saw one a couple of weeks ago I thought maybe a dog or something had eaten it but just having seen the two again that I came across this weekend it does look like from what I can see that that’s what happened.
“They seem to have been more cleanly taken off.”
The Irish Seal Rescue (ISS) said the recent discoveries certainly merit investigation but until post mortems are carried out it will be hard to say for certain how the seals died.
Brendan Price, ISS chair, said the injuries suffered by one seal he saw could be consistent with gunshot wounds but he couldn’t say for certain given the range of injuries he’s witnessed over the years.

“We used to think that decapitations were propeller injuries. Later it was suggested that they were entanglements,” he said.
“More and more sadly you’ll see seals with a ligature around their neck, and if they’re growing it kills them. 
The other thing is with the dead seals, the head is the heaviest part of the seal and as it decomposes in water sometimes it falls off. And it does look like it has been done by a surgeon. 
“So, without any form of post-mortem its hard to say with any certitude that it was shot. What we would say is it is amongst the possibilities,” Price said. 
ISS set up the dead seal data base several years ago to get a better picture of patterns and locations of seal injuries and deaths. The database is entirely dependent on people sending in information and Price says it is time the State takes on that responsibility.

270,187,"Covid-19 is the fourth most common underlying cause for registered deaths in Ireland so far this year",https://www.thejournal.ie/cso-underlying-cause-death-5276913-Nov2020/,"COVID-19 HAS BEEN listed as the fourth most common underlying cause for registered deaths in Ireland in the first 10 months of this year.
In a new update from the Central Statistics Office (CSO), based on deaths registered with the General Registrar’s Office, it said that a total of 22,416 deaths were registered from 1 January 2020 to 31 October 2020 across the country. 
The most common underlying causes of death cited were cancer (7,269 deaths), diseases of the circulatory system/heart (5,886) and diseases of the respiratory system/lungs (2,390). 
Between them, the top three listed above were identified in just under 70% of reported deaths in Ireland so far this year.
Covid-19 accounted for 1,462 of the registered deaths, or 6.5%. 
However, according to Department of Health figures, the number of deaths in people with Covid-19 is far higher. The death toll stands now at 2,022. At the end of October, it was 1,915.
In addressing this discrepancy between the figures, the CSO said: “It is important to note that there will be a number of deaths where Covid-19 will not be assigned as the [underlying cause of death] and therefore, the Covid-19 deaths in this analysis, will vary from those put into the public domain by the Department of Health.
A Covid-19 death is defined, for surveillance purposes, as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness in a probable or confirmed Covid-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to Covid-19 (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death.
Legally, in Ireland, a death can be registered up to three months after the date of occurrence and therefore not all deaths that took place between 01 January 2020 and 31 October 2020 are included in this. The CSO estimates that approximately 2,500 to 3,500 deaths remain to be registered covering the period of analysis in this output.
Ireland has been counting Covid-19 deaths on foot of advice from the World Health Organization, which issued guidance on the matter earlier this year. The CSO said that the hierarchy in which the causes of death are written on a death certificate will impact on what it assigns to be the underlying cause of death for the purposes of this data. 
The guidelines note there is “increasing evidence that people with existing chronic conditions or compromised immune systems due to disability are at higher risk of death due to Covid-19″.
FactFind: Here is how Covid-19 deaths are counted in Ireland
The document adds that if the person who died had a non-communicable disease such as coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or diabetes, this should also be reported on their death certificate.

The Department of Health has said that, in following the WHO’s guidance, it has “sought to provide the fullest and most accurate picture possible of the impact of Covid-19″.
It has also noted in the past that in those who died with Covid-19 who already had underlying conditions, “may have continued to live for a long time if they had not contracted it”.
“It is important to note that a third of people in Ireland (32%) have a long-standing health condition,” a department spokesperson said. “This is a significant part of our society. Every single person with an underlying medical condition is important. Their lives matter.”
The CSO said today that, by age group, 8.1% of deaths among those aged 80 or over listed Covid-19 as an underlying cause of death. 
This was in fifth place behind diseases of the circulatory system, cancer, diseases of the respiratory system and mental and behavioural disorders such as Alzheimer’s Disease.
Among other age groups, Covid-19 was cited as an underlying cause in 5.4% of deaths in people aged 65-79, 3.3% in people aged 50-64 and 2.1% in people aged 25-49.

The CSO added that deaths attributed to external causes of injury and poisoning – such as car accidents – are under-represented in the analysis as such deaths are frequently reported to the Coroner’s Office for further investigation.

This decision follows a meeting with representatives from Epilepsy Ireland the the Organisation for Anti-Convulsant Syndrome Ireland. 
Valproate-containing medicines can cause birth defects and developmental disorders in children whose mothers take such medicines during pregnancy. 
Read more here on how you can support a major Noteworthy investigation into why Irish women were not told for decades about an epilepsy drug that causes birth defects.
Sodium valproate has been subject to two recent reviews by the European Medicines Agency in 2014 and 2017. 
The HSE has estimated that up to 1,250 children may have been impacted in Ireland between 1975 and 2015.
Strict measures were put in place 2018 to warn women of the dangers of the drug. It must now be initiated by a specialist and can no longer be used in women and girls unless the conditions of a pregnancy prevention programme (called Prevent) are met.
A risk acknowledgement form must also be completed and signed by the patient and prescriber every year.
Epilepsy Ireland identified in a survey in July of this year, however, that less than 30% of women have heard of the mandatory Prevent programme and just 22% have been asked by their healthcare professional to sign the annual risk acknowledgement form.

Inquiry
Minister Donnelly has asked officials to examine a number of difficult options for the structure of the inquiry, but emphasised that he favours a streamlined process that builds on existing knowledge and findings from other jurisdictions. 
He also stressed that testimonies from families affected by disabilities associated with the drug will need to be central to the process. 
“Parents and children impacted by sodium valproate have been fighting for many years for an inquiry into the licencing and use of this drug,” Donnelly said. 
“Inquiries on this drug have already taken place in other countries, including in France and in the UK, and so we can draw on those learnings, but I also want to ensure that the voices of Irish families and their experiences are listened to and reflected on throughout this inquiry,” he said.

Dublin City Council has rejected plans for a five-storey “recreational and interpretative centre” next to An Taisce’s nature reserve at Booterstown Marsh over concerns that it could cause water pollution in Dublin Bay.
The site is located opposite the former Tara Towers Hotel on the Merrion Road.
With habitats in decline, our colleagues at Noteworthy want to find out if the Government is adequately protecting our natural world? Support this project here.
The large-scale project had been proposed by Soundvale, a development firm owned by well-known businessman, Paddy McKillen Jnr, of the Press Up entertainment and hospitality group which runs a large number of bars, restaurants and hotels in Ireland.
The company had sought approval for an 18.5m metre high building consisting of an interpretive centre, crèche, café, restaurant, health studios, gym, spa, swimming pool, jacuzzi and hydro pool.
Although Soundvale said the interpretive centre was not commercially driven, it envisaged charging an entrance fee to ensure it was sustainable and generated income.
The centre, which had a capacity for 120 visitors at any one time, was due to be managed by an independent, not-for-profit entity, while the recreational facilities were due to be run by the Press Up group.
The biodiversity proposals for the site included a new coastal meadow, tree belt, shrub garden and bird hide.
Rejecting the application, Dublin City Council said it could not be satisfied that the proposed development would not have a significant impact on wetlands in Dublin Bay.
The council said the project would run contrary to its policy to conserve and manage protected habitats by ensuring that any adverse environmental effects were avoided, remedied or mitigated where sustainable coastal recreational facilities were proposed.
A report by council planners said the location of the proposed development was “a highly sensitive, environmentally valuable site” which was one of a few remaining vacant coastal sites within the council’s administrative boundaries.
“There is therefore a critical need to ensure that any development respects and protects the biodiversity of the site,” the report stated.
It noted that information provided by Soundvale could not alleviate the council’s concerns that excavation work in areas of contaminated soils containing mineral oil might adversely affect groundwater which could impact on protected areas within Dublin Bay.
The council claimed dust emissions from the site would also have a moderate to high ecological impact, while a report supplied by the developer acknowledged that the project had the potential to impact on wildlife during the construction phase.
Although a Natura Impact Statement furnished by Soundvale claimed the project would not adversely affect protected habitats, the council said it had not been able to conclude “that the development could proceed without detriment to the environment”.

Separate decision
A separate but related decision about the project is due from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council as the 1.9 hectare site occupies land in the administrative area of the two local authorities.
The main building was located within the area governed by Dublin City Council.
The plans were also opposed by An Taisce, which claimed they would set an undesirable precedent for development of a large scale commercial nature on green and open spaces in the city.
An Taisce said the commercial leisure facilities would be much more appropriately located in the new hotel being built on the site of the former Tara Towers hotel.
The development was also opposed by the Friends of Booterstown Coast group which claimed the site is located in the buffer zone for the UNESCO Dublin Bay Biosphere as well as being prone to flooding.
The group, some of whose members attempted to buy the site when it was controlled by NAMA, claimed the proposal was for a “commercial leisure development” which, if approved, would represent a material contravention of the existing city development plan.
Soundvale claimed its objective was “to deliver a world class recreational facility and interpretative centre in a coastal meadow and biodiversity-rich setting” that would benefit the local and wider community.","The site is located opposite the former Tara Towers Hotel on the Merrion Road.",9,0,0,18040,"4 hours ago"

Staff believed that the precious items had been “mis-shelved” within the vast archives late in the year 2000 and the matter was not reported to Cambridgeshire Police until 20 October this year.
The force said it has launched an investigation and notified Interpol.
It is difficult to estimate the value of the notebooks given their unique nature but it would probably run into many millions of pounds, the library said.
The two notebooks, including Darwin’s seminal 1837 Tree of Life sketch, were removed from storage to be photographed at the library’s photographic unit, where the work was recorded as completed in November 2000.
During a subsequent routine check in January 2001 it was found that the small blue box containing the notebooks had not been returned to its proper place.
Building work
Jessica Gardner, university librarian and director of library services since 2017, said: “My predecessors genuinely believed that what had happened was that these had been mis-shelved or misfiled and they took forward extensive searches over the years in that genuine belief.
“Now we have completely reviewed as a new team what happened and come to a conclusion that that’s not a sufficient position or set of actions to take.”
She said that “extensive building work” was taking place at the library at the time that the items were found to be missing.
There have been continuous searches since the notebooks went missing, she said, and it is now thought “likely that theft occurred”.
Gardner reported the matter to police.
An appeal for information has been launched on the advice of external experts, including at the Metropolitan Police’s arts and antique specialist crime unit, Dr Gardner said.
She said there are currently no leads.
‘Heartbroken’
Dr Mark Purcell, deputy director of Research Collections, said he is confident the manuscripts could not be sold on the open market and it is possible they have “gone to ground”.
He said he hoped for a similar outcome to that of London’s Lambeth Palace, where items were stolen after bombing during the Second World War.
“Forty-plus years later, quite literally as the consequence of a deathbed crisis of conscience, those items came to light and were returned to Lambeth and I think that’s the sort of outcome which we and all institutions of this kind would clearly wish to hope for,” he said.

Dr Gardner said that security policy was different 20 years ago, adding: “Today any such significant missing object would be reported as a potential theft immediately and a widespread search begun.”
“I’m heartbroken,” she added.
“We’ve devoted the whole of our careers to the preservation of cultural heritage and we’re devastated by what has happened.”

With the large volume of poor quality, unsafe or non-compliant products being imported into Ireland, the CPCC has created a checklist of what to look out for to ensure parents are ‘safety aware’ this Christmas. 
Check for the CE mark on toys before you buy them. The CE mark is a manufacturer’s declaration that the product complies with EU safety regulations and standards. 
Buy from a reputable retailer to avoid unsafe, non-compliant toys, or toys with a fake CE mark. If you’re buying online do some quick research, check reviews and social media pages, and where the business is based. 
Check for detachable parts smaller than €2 Coin as anything smaller than this could be a potential choking hazard for children.
Check age guidance instructions on all children’s toys, in particular 0-3 years, before you buy them. 
Check for sharp edges, long cords or cables and avoid dangerous or fold-away parts or small holes that could trap children’s fingers.","Over 51,000 toys have been destroyed by the CCPC in the last few years.",2,0,0,34038,"4 hours ago"

McConalogue’s comments come following reports that the UK and the EU are engaging in last-minute talks to prevent a ‘two-way ban’ on certain meat products between the UK and the island of Ireland.
RTÉ reports that the UK intends to replicate the EU’s food safety regime which restricts meat products from outside the union. The UK’s reciprocal ban would prohibit such products from entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.
Read more here on how you can support a major Noteworthy project to find out if recent price crashes has exposed the beef sector’s soft underbelly.
Speaking to Morning Ireland, McConalogue said the issue is concerning but very much reflective of Brexit. 
“Obviously it is something which is concerning, it’s a reflection of the many issues which Brexit is causing,” he said. 
“Also, the fact that we haven’t had an agreed trade deal yet and discussions are still ongoing despite the intention and the hope that this would have been resolved previously. This emphasises the importance of a deal being finalised promptly.
“Obviously there’s going to be significant work then required in the weeks ahead as well to ensure that the trade is as smooth, and as efficient as possible on the first of January.”
At 11pm on 31 December, Brexit in practice will kick in and the UK will be leaving the Customs Union and the Single Market, which will have a huge impact on people and business owners in Ireland who send goods to, from or through the UK.
This will mean that the EU – and by extension, Ireland – will treat Great Britain as a ‘third country’ for the purposes of trade.
Regardless of whether there is a trade deal done by then, McConalogue said documentation will have to be in place for all exports going to Britain, varying across a range of different products.
Speaking yesterday, Taoiseach Micheal Martin said there has been “intensive” engagement for weeks and there are now “texts on all areas”. He added that it remained to be seen whether the text on the outstanding areas could be agreed.
Over 90% of topics have been agreed upon and drafted but three main obstacles have remained as a block to securing a final deal before the deadline: the level playing field, governance, and fisheries.

Martin said that a deal is “in the best interest of the United Kingdom, of Ireland and of the European Union”.

The CPT has today published its report on its seventh periodic visit to Ireland, which took place from 25 September to 4 October 2019. 
In the five prison establishments visited, prisoners stated that the vast majority of prison officers treated them correctly.
However, a small number of prison officers are inclined to use more physical force than is necessary and to verbally abuse prisoners, the committee outlined. 
The CPT also found that the current complaints system cannot be considered fit for purpose. 
The committee outlined that most people stated that they were treated corrected by gardaí when detained. 
However, it said there were several allegations of physical ill-treatment and verbal disrespect from remand prisoners. These allegations mostly involved slaps, kicks and punches to various parts of the body. 
Mental health
The Committee was critical of the use of special observation cells (SOCs) in prisons and has called for their use to be reviewed. 
At the time of the committee’s visit to Cloverhill Prison on 29-30 September 2019, one mentally unwell man (identified as PM) was found lying naked in his cell, with the cell smeared with faeces and puddles of urine on the floor.
He had been managed in an SOC since 17 September, awaiting transfer to the Central Mental Hospital. 
There were no blankets in the cell and his clothing – described in the report as a ‘poncho’ – was lying next to him, soaked in urine.
Prison officers explained that the door to the SOC was only opened using the protection of a shield to pass him food. 
During his time in the cell, he had not been provided with a shower or let out of the cell. 
PM was bailed by the High Court to a psychiatric hospital in the community on 2 October 2019. However, the CPT noted that he had still not been afforded a shower prior to his transfer. 
The CPT said the condition this man, along with another inmate, were found in might amount to “inhuman and degrading treatment”. 
The CPT stated that the high support units at Cloverhill, Cork and Mountjoy prisons – which accommodate mentally ill prisoners – offered poor conditions and inadequate treatment.
It said that if the high support units at the three prisons are to provide a stepping stone towards admission to a psychiatric hospital or a step-down unit for managing people returned to prison from a psychiatric facility, it is essential that they be provided with the appropriate resources. 
This is not currently the case, the CPT said, adding that a programme of structured activities, including occupational therapy sessions, should be developed for prisoners held on these units. 
Another major concern from the CPT was the rising number of homeless people with severe mental health problems who are ending up in prison. 
Immigration
The CPT found that immigration detainees continue to be held at Cloverhill Prison, and other prisons, with remand and convicted prisoners. It said that in some cases they are subject to abuse and bullying. 
The CPT has called upon the authorities to put in place a specifically designed centre for immigration detainees with specific immigration rules in accordance with the Committee’s requirements. 
It has requested information on the conditions and regime afforded to immigration detainees pending the opening of such a unit.

Reform
The committee acknowledged that steps have been taken by the Irish authorities since 2014 to reform the prison system. 
It welcomed the fact that children are no longer held in prison. 
However, it noted that considerable challenges remain. 
In particular, it recommended that action should be taken to address local overcrowding in prisons and to ensure prisoners do not have to sleep on mattresses on the floor, and that all multiple occupancy cells are equipped with fully partitioned toilet facilities. 
Response
In its response to the report, the Irish government provide information on the steps being taken to address the issues raised by the CPT. 
In particular, it refers to the ongoing reform process of An Garda Síochána and the various measures being taken to promote alternatives to imprisonment and to ensure that prisons have sufficient capacity and are able to provide adequate conditions and regimes. 
Reference is also made to a number of prison reviews in the areas of health care, including mental health, and the use of SOCs, as well as the reform of the complaints system. 
The government said mental health in the criminal justice system is a top priority. 
It said the Minister for Justice is engaging with the Minister for Health with a view to the early establishment of a taskforce on the matter.

Some of RTÉ’s most well-known presenters have apologised for breaching social distancing guidelines at the gathering. The broadcaster has said it was a “short impromptu gathering” and that “social distancing was observed overall”.
Williams made his apology as he delivered the John Cunningham Journalism Lecture to NUI Galway students yesterday.
He said he wanted to acknowledge that RTÉ had been in the news rather than making the news recently. He said he had been one of the people pictured failing to observe social distancing and that he deeply regretted it.
“I apologise unreservedly and I am sorry that I failed to do the right thing on this occasion,” he said.
Williams said RTÉ should lead by example and the best way for it to rebuild trust was to continue to “do what we do”.

Gardaí meet RTÉ officials over social distancing controversy
Gardaí have met with senior RTÉ officials as part of their inquiries into potential coronavirus rule breaches.
Garda inquiries are focusing on whether the gathering was in breach of coronavirus regulations prohibiting the organisation of indoor events involving more than two households.
Failing to socially distance or wear a mask at such an event is not an offence under the regulations.
Following the meeting yesterday, a garda spokesman said the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions would be sought on whether further action was required.

The most famous of them all is his great-uncle Charlie, who played under Matt Busby at Manchester United before he followed greats like Alfredo Di Stefano in moving to Colombia. 
In 1950, Charlie was approached by a Spaniard called Santiago Bernabeu, sounded out for interest in joining the team he was assembling at Real Madrid. Charlie’s wife was homesick, however, and he instead returned to England, where Busby refused to take him back as he had broken his contract to move to South America. He ultimately joined Fulham, and later managed Newcastle. 
Andy didn’t quite get the talents of his great-uncle, and instead forged a different career in the game, and is now editor-at-large for FourFourTwo and a contributor to a range of outlets including the BBC, the Athletic and the Sunday Times. 
He is perhaps best known as the founder of Manchester United fanzine, United We Stand. He set it up in 1989 as a 15-year-old student and, more than 30 years on, it is one of Britain’s best-selling fanzines. 
“I felt football fans got a raw deal. Being asked to pay four pounds to stand on a crap terrace, thinking, ‘This is wrong, we are being treated like cattle’”, says Andy of his desire to give fans a voice through United We Stand. 
Andy is our latest guest on Behind the Lines, our weekly sportswriting podcast exclusive to members of The42.

Two years after its founding, Andy scored his first interview with Alex Ferguson for United We Stand. 
“I wrote to him requesting an interview and he wrote straight back. ‘I don’t like fanzines, but I’ve read United We Stand and it’s a bit different. If you want to do an interview, come and introduce yourself on the pre-season tour in Norway.’ 
“I introduced myself to him, as he came out of the shower with a towel on in Lillestrom. Then I interviewed him in Trondheim. It was a terrible interview. It was one of my first interviews, and it was with Ferguson! 
“I also look back and think, ‘What an idiot.’
“It wasn’t very good. I told him after an hour I had to go and meet my mates. Why was I calling time on an interview with Ferguson? I also took a mate along, as I didn’t realise you weren’t allowed to take a mate. He was laughing at us. I recorded the thing on a tape-to-tape ghetto blaster. He was laughing and must have been thinking, ‘Who is this idiot?’ And I was an idiot. I look back now at that interview and cringe. You learn how to do follow-up questions and how to do your job properly.” 
Happily, his first interview with Ferguson was not his last. 
“I had ups and downs with him. I had times getting the hairdryer treatment: I remember reviewing his autobiography. It was a good review, but I explained why he had been critical of certain people, and he didn’t like that. At all. 
“Next time he granted an interview to me, he was a bit frosty with me, but he did grant me the interview. Then the tape went off and he’s like, Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang.

“‘What do you know about books?’
“I thought, ‘I’m not scared of you, at all. I know about books because I write books.’
“So he’s put me on the ropes, and just as I’m about to swing back, verbally…’Anyway son, it’s great to see you.’
“That’s really clever. He’s made his point, and he gave me a good interview. I don’t think he liked the fanzines, particularly the fact we objected to the Glazer takeover of United. 
“We have to agree to disagree on that. I’d rather remember him for some of the greatest moments ever. Thanks to that man I travelled the world.” 
Did he ever figure Ferguson out? 
“I wasn’t at all the press conferences…maybe I didn’t want to be. Maybe I didn’t want to lose my love for him; maybe I didn’t want to see too much of that side to him.
“Maybe I still wanted to sing his name and celebrate when he decided to stay at United? I know there is a huge amount of goodness there, and incredible acts of kindness. We disagree on other stuff, that’s fine.

283,189,"China's mission to bring back material from moon blasts off",https://www.thejournal.ie/china-pace-mission-moon-materials-change-5-5276830-Nov2020/,"CHINA HAS LAUNCHED an ambitious mission to bring back material from the moon’s surface for the first time in more than 40 years – an undertaking that could boost human understanding of the moon and of the solar system more generally.
Chang’e 5 – named after the Chinese moon goddess – is the country’s boldest lunar mission yet. If successful, it would be a major advance for China’s space programme, and some experts say it could pave the way for bringing samples back from Mars or even a crewed lunar mission.
The four modules of the Chang’e 5 spacecraft blasted off on top of a massive Long March-5Y rocket from the Wenchang launch centre along the coast of the southern island province of Hainan.
Minutes after liftoff, the spacecraft separated from the rocket’s first and second stages and slipped into Earth-moon transfer orbit. Spacecraft typically take three days to reach the moon.
The mission’s key task is to drill two metres beneath the moon’s surface and scoop up about 2kg of rocks and other debris to be brought back to Earth, according to Nasa. That would offer the first opportunity for scientists to study newly obtained lunar material since the American and Russian missions of the 1960s and 1970s.
The Chang’e 5 lander’s time on the moon is scheduled to be short and sweet. It can only stay one lunar daytime, or about 14 Earth days, because it lacks the radioisotope heating units to withstand the moon’s freezing nights.
The Long March-5 rocket on the launch pad
The lander will dig for materials with its drill and robotic arm and transfer them to what is called an ascender, which will lift off from the moon and dock with the service capsule. The materials will then be moved to the return capsule to be hauled back to Earth.
The mission is among China’s boldest since it first put a man in space in 2003, becoming only the third nation to do so after the US and Russia.
While many of China’s crewed space flight achievements, including building an experimental space station and conducting a spacewalk, reproduce those of other countries from years past, the China National Space Administration is moving into new territory.

284,189,"The Cambridge Dictionary's Word of the Year is... 'quarantine'",https://www.thejournal.ie/cambridge-dictionary-word-of-the-year-5276829-Nov2020/,"THE CAMBRIDGE DICTIONARY has revealed its word of the year for 2020 as “quarantine”, after it took on a new meaning during the coronavirus pandemic.
Editors said that quarantine was the third most looked-up word overall this year – and comes out on top if you discount words that recur most years, “hello” in first and “dictionary” in second.
It edged out other finalist words “pandemic” and “lockdown”, which were also among the most looked-up between January and the end of October this year.
There was a surge of searches for quarantine in the week of 18-24 March, when restrictions started to be imposed in many countries due to Covid-19.
Editors tracked how people were using the word quarantine and as a result have added an extra meaning to the dictionary.
This is: “A general period of time in which people are not allowed to leave their homes or travel freely, so that they do not catch or spread a disease.”
It marks a shift from existing meanings that relate to containing a person or animal suspected of being contagious.
Research indicates that the word is being used synonymously with lockdown, particularly in the United States, to refer to a situation in which people stay home to avoid catching the disease.
Wendalyn Nichols, Cambridge Dictionary publishing manager, said: “The words that people search for reveal not just what is happening in the world, but what matters most to them in relation to those events.
“Neither coronavirus nor Covid-19 appeared among the words that Cambridge Dictionary users searched for most this year.
“We believe this indicates that people have been fairly confident about what the virus is.
“Instead, users have been searching for words related to the social and economic impacts of the pandemic, as evidenced not just by ‘quarantine’ but by the two runners-up on the shortlist for Word of the Year: ‘lockdown’, and ‘pandemic’ itself.”

Several new words have been added to the dictionary this year which relate to the pandemic, including “Covid-19”.
Others include “HyFlex”, which is short for hybrid flexible and denotes a type of teaching in which some students are physically present in class and others join the same class at the same time from a distance, using the internet.
“Elbow bump”, a friendly greeting in which people touch elbows, and “social distancing”, to describe the practice of keeping away from others to stop the spread of disease, have also been added.
Editors asked readers in a poll if they thought that a list of other new words should be added to the dictionary.
Many are portmanteau words, which combine the first part of one word with the second part of another, and they are as follows:
Quaranteam: A group of people who go into quarantine together
Lockstalgia: A feeling of nostalgia for the lockdown period of the Covid-19 pandemic
Quaranteen: A teenager in the time of the Covid-19 lockdown
Coronnial: Someone who was born around the time of the Covid-19 pandemic

In a global society that can feel increasingly atomised, years such as this show us that Ireland’s spirit of generosity remains strong. 
Unfortunately, the benevolent ethos that I know to be so strong in this country is not reflected by the State’s attitude to migrants and people from a migrant background.
Against the backdrop of the pandemic, headlines abound about increased waits for citizenship applications and visa extensions; hunger strikes in Direct Provision centres, organised by asylum-seekers desperate for their concerns about living conditions to be addressed; deportation orders for undocumented health workers who prioritised the wellbeing of Ireland, only to be rejected from it during a public health crisis. Our ‘céad míle fáilte’ comes with a caveat.
A thousand welcomes?
The truth is, Ireland’s citizenship laws are not as generous as they could be. This is manifest in our current policy regarding some children born here to migrant parents, resulting from the 2004 referendum to insert the 27th Amendment to the Constitution. 
For those who don’t know, the 27th Amendment removed the automatic constitutional right to citizenship for all people born in Ireland, leaving it up to the Oireachtas to legislate to regulate citizenship.
The xenophobic campaign that ensued was a shameful period in our history, with reports of Black African families being booed on polling day. So-called ‘maternity tourism’ gave cover for the calling of this referendum.
That is the phenomenon whereby women supposedly came to Ireland from across the globe in their droves to give birth and claim Irish citizenship. Evidently, voters found the story to be compelling.
Not a single constituency in the State rejected the referendum, which passed by a margin of 58.34 per cent.
A misinformed electorate?
Learn more
The Government of the day cited statistics from the Rotunda to prove the veracity of the claim that maternity tourism was overwhelming Irish maternity hospitals; they said that there had been a significant spike in the number of babies being born to non-national mothers. 
However, these statistics included babies born to a non-national mother and an Irish father. So too did they include babies born to migrant parents who were nationals of another European Union member-state and who, therefore, benefitted from EU citizenship and could remain regardless of whether they were a citizen of this country. Indeed, approximately 70 per cent of non-nationals living in Ireland in 2002 were from a European Union member state, according to the Census which preceded the referendum.
It was, therefore, the case that most children born to a non-national in Ireland would be either unaffected by the 27th Amendment or would be entitled by EU law to remain in Ireland regardless.
The reality was that this referendum would only ever affect a very small minority of children born here. However, for those affected, the referendum and subsequent legislation that passed which grants automatic citizenship based on blood ties with Ireland, rather than birthright, was and is profound. Now, two children born side by side in an Irish hospital are no longer to be cherished equally, as was envisaged by the authors of the Proclamation.
Opponents of the referendum campaign, including my own party, Labour, said that this referendum, which was triggered by a statistically insignificant and sensationalist claim would have dire consequences on the children for whom it would have an effect. 
The human cost
Indeed, these concerns have been borne out in the years since that campaign. Notoriously, in 2018, a deportation order was issued to “return” an Irish-born nine-year-old boy called Eric from his native Bray to China. Eric’s mother is Chinese and, therefore, despite never having been to China, it was considered by the Irish State to be his rightful home.
Serving this deportation order opened up the risk that Eric could become stateless – a scandalous but inevitable result of the laws we have. Ironically, under Chinese law, a person born in China to stateless parents or parents of uncertain nationality who have settled in the country receives automatic citizenship.
How unnerving that a country with a human rights record like China’s might be more progressive than Ireland on an issue such as this.
Luckily, Eric’s schoolmates and friends rallied around him and lobbied their local TD, then Minister for Health Simon Harris to revoke this deportation order. The story made national news and Eric was granted leave to remain.
Other, similar stories have made headlines and, in every case, the majority of voices advocate for these children to be allowed to stay. In practice, it is a small minority who would want to exclude a child from their community; in practice, society moves to protect children from deportation. Nevertheless, the possibility looms, due to our ungenerous laws.

Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill
To address this situation which impacts families like Eric’s, in 2018, Labour introduced a bill. The Irish Nationality and Citizenship (Naturalisation of Minors Born in Ireland) Bill 2018 proposes a modest change to amend the law to enable children who are born in Ireland and who have lived here for three years to be considered for naturalisation as an Irish citizen, irrespective of the status of their parents.
Crucially, this measure does not require a second referendum, as the 27th Amendment leaves it up to the Oireachtas to determine how citizenship should be regulated.
The bill was passed through the Second Stage in the Seanad by a majority of Senators, including Fianna Fáil and the Green Party, but not Fine Gael Senators. We are now bringing the Bill back before the Seanad in the first week of December and are calling on this new coalition Government to support it. 
Aside from the obvious moral arguments in favour of supporting our bill, to do so would be politically advantageous too. Polling conducted by Behaviour and Attitudes for the Sunday Times in 2018 found that 71 per cent of Irish voters believe that anyone born in Ireland should be entitled to citizenship. Clearly, the existing approach of the State is incongruent with the attitudes of the public.
Those who are affected are silenced by the precarity of their situation. There are people across the country today who live in fear that their child and could be deported should they come to the attention of the State, even if Ireland is the only place they know.
These children are our neighbours; they go to school with our own children; they have much to give to this country and much is owed to them. Afraid to raise their heads above the parapet, they need the support of us all in their bid for certainty and belonging.
Just as successive Irish Governments have stood and continue to stand for the rights of undocumented Irish migrants in the United States of America, the Irish Government of today should vote for Labour’s bill to protect the rights of undocumented children in Ireland. Children who are born here belong here.

Source: DPA/PA Images
US PRESIDENT DONALD Trump has come his closest yet to admitting election defeat after the government agency meant to ease Joe Biden’s transition into the White House said it is finally lifting its unprecedented block on assistance.
Trump acknowledged it was time for the General Services Administration to “do what needs to be done”.
In the same tweet he insisted that he was still refusing to concede, saying: “Our case STRONGLY continues, we will keep up the good fight, and I believe we will prevail!”
This step means that Biden’s team will now have access to funds, office space and the ability to meet with federal officials. 
Biden’s office, which hours earlier announced a highly experienced group to be nominated for top US foreign policy and security posts, said the GSA would now allow “support necessary to carry out a smooth and peaceful transfer of power”.
“In the days ahead, transition officials will begin meeting with federal officials to discuss the pandemic response, have a full accounting of our national security interests, and gain complete understanding of the Trump administration’s efforts to hollow out government agencies,” Biden’s transition director Yohannes Abraham said in a statement.
The sudden break in Trump’s dogged attempt to deny Biden’s win came after Michigan became the latest state to certify its results and more powerful Trump supporters came out demanding that the impasse end.
Biden to shift diplomacy
Earlier, Biden announced a foreign policy and national security team crammed with veterans from the Barack Obama years, teeing up an end to the upheaval under Trump and a return to traditional US diplomacy.
Top of the list was former State Department number two Antony Blinken, tapped for secretary of state.

Biden also named the first female head of intelligence, the first Latino chief of Homeland Security, the first woman as treasury secretary, and a heavyweight pointman on climate issues – Obama-era top diplomat John Kerry.

The list put out by Biden’s team ahead of a formal announcement today demonstrated a push to bring back the US role of leader in multilateral alliances, in contrast to Trump’s “America first” regime.
“They will rally the world to take on our challenges like no other – challenges that no one nation can face alone,” Biden tweeted. “It’s time to restore American leadership.”
Blinken, a longtime advisor to Biden, will spearhead a fast-paced dismantling of Trump’s go-it-alone policies, including rejoining the Paris climate agreement and the World Health Organization and resurrecting the Obama-crafted Iran nuclear deal.

US election officials say there is 'no evidence' of compromised votes
Biden named the first woman, Avril Haines, as director of national intelligence, and Cuban-born Alejandro Mayorkas to head the Department of Homeland Security, the agency whose policing of tough immigration restrictions under Trump was a frequent source of controversy.
Signaling the Democratic president-elect’s campaign promise to raise the profile of global warming threats, he named Kerry as a new special envoy on climate issues.
And in a further message of US re-engagement with the international community, Biden named career diplomat Linda Thomas-Greenfield for UN ambassador. 
Jake Sullivan, who also advised Biden when he was vice president under Obama, was named national security advisor.
Picked to manage the world’s biggest economy as Treasury secretary was Janet Yellen, who will make history as the first woman in the job if confirmed. The 74-year-old was confirmed as Federal Reserve chairwoman under Obama in 2014 and replaced by Trump four years later.
The picks underline an emphasis on professionals whom Biden already knows well, in contrast to the Trump White House where officials were often picked without having traditional background for the job or proved incompatible and departed in acrimony.
Dwindling options
The president, meanwhile, has largely halted at least his public work duties, while heading out to a golf course he owns in Virginia half a dozen times since the election.
He has also not taken questions from reporters since the election – a previously unimaginable silence from a president who for most of his time in office sparred near daily with the press.

His options for overturning the election, however, are dwindling rapidly in the face of repeated court defeats.
With Biden having won a comfortable victory, Trump’s last card is to disrupt the normally routine process of state-by-state certification of results, followed by the formal 14 December vote by the Electoral College. However, that too is bearing little fruit.
More cracks appeared in the facade of Republican unity yesterday when Senator Rob Portman said it was “time to expeditiously resolve any outstanding questions and move forward”.
Senator Lamar Alexander, a senior Republican and close ally of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said “it seems apparent that Joe Biden will be the president-elect”.
“My hope is that President Trump will take pride in his considerable accomplishments, put the country first and have a prompt and orderly transition to help the new administration succeed,” he said after having issued a similar if less forthright statement a few days earlier.

The Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI) today reported figures from across the banking sector which revealed that overall card fraud reached €22 million in 2019. 
The BPFI said that 260,000 fraudulent debit and credit card transactions took place last year and that, despite a significant fall in payment card fraud in recent years, consumers shopping online should  be “extra vigilant” over the coming weeks. 
More than 90% of card fraud took place online, via telephone or mail order, rather than in-store last year, according to the BPFI. 
Brian Hayes, Chief Executive BPFI said today: “Card fraud losses have been on a downward trend over the last three years and in 2019 were at their lowest level since 2012.
“This comes at a time when there has been a significant increase in card usage. The fall in losses can be attributed to a combination of better detection and fraud monitoring systems which banks have put in place, but also to the fact that consumers are becoming more aware of the risks of card fraud and the ways in which they can protect themselves from falling victim.”
Research carried out by the BPFI shows that six out of 10 people say they will do more of their Christmas shopping online this year and that those aged between 18 and 24 are most at-risk of fraud.
According to the federation, 39% of people sometimes or always click on links from social media adverts rather than visiting the relevant website independently. This figure jumped to 59% among those aged 18-24.

In addition, 35% of people shopping online rarely or never check the security of the website they are shopping while 43% rarely or never read an online retailer’s terms and conditions.
“As Covid restrictions and the pre-Christmas rush draws thousands of shoppers online we are urging all consumers to take extra precautions when shopping online this year,” said Hayes. 
The BPFI has issued guidelines to help consumers avoid card fraud this Christmas:
Use secure websites. The website address should be ‘https’ before the purchase is made, indicating a secure connection
Use sites where a padlock symbol is shown beside the website address
Do not under any circumstances use public Wi-Fi when making payments – switch to 3G/4G on your phone if necessary
Independently visit the website of the online sales company as opposed to clicking on social media or pop-up adverts
Be cautious about claiming outrageous offers – if it sounds too good to be true it probably is

While there had been speculation that the public announcement might be made on Thursday, so as not to clash with the Late Late Toy Show, it is understood that the government is planning to make details known on Friday with the Taoiseach giving a national address.
Yesterday, Micheál Martin said that “no decisions have been made as yet” as to exactly what restrictions will follow Level 5.
He said there will be meetings with the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and Covid-19 subcommittee this week, with the Cabinet meeting for a second time later in the week to discuss the most up to date data before an announcement is made.
“We will engage with NPHET and I’ve been in touch with the Chief Medical Officer.  NPHET obviously will give its advice but government will decide how we exit Level 5 and that will be a decision of government that will be taken this week, either towards Thursday or Friday,” he said.  
However, he added that the government, not NPHET, would be making the final call. 
Government sources state that today’s Cabinet meeting will be important, and while ministers and the Taoiseach won’t make a “definite call” on the level of restrictions, it will give a good indication as to the direction the country is headed for Christmas.
When asked about the timing of the announcement to the public, a government source said “we are all aware of the Toy Show issue”, indicating that if the Taoiseach is to give an address, it would not clash with the programme, set to air at 9.35pm, and would take place earlier in the day. 
What can be expected? 
The Taoiseach said yesterday that Level 3 and Level 5 restrictions have worked in terms of bringing down the case numbers. He appeared positive about moving away from Level 5 restrictions. 
There will be good news for retailers as all non-essential shops are set to reopen.

It is understood that retailers will also be given the green light to extend opening hours. While such a move usually requires planning permission, it is believed local authorities have been doing a lot of work with businesses to facilitate the longer opening hours.

Johnson outlines new tougher tiers of restrictions for England and warns of risk of 'New Year surge'
This is to mitigate crowds of shoppers descending on retailers in the weeks up to Christmas.
The main battleground for the government is whether pubs and restaurants will reopen for December.  
Under the current draft plan, it is understood that the aim is to keep restaurants open permanently once the lockdown ends next week.
However, there is doubt in government circles that wet pubs will be given the green light to open their doors.
No final decisions have been made yet. However, it is understood that in order to allow restaurants and pubs that serve food to open, one option under consideration is delaying their reopening by one week from 1 December. 
Drink-only pubs and pubs that serve food may also have to have earlier closing times.
“We have looked at a lot of research on this, we’ve looked at what happened from August, September, October, we looked at international data. There are super spreader events, gatherings and congregation facilitate the spread of the virus. Gatherings and congregation with events with alcohol facilitate the spread of the virus. Ultimately, vigilance is key, human behaviour is key,” the Taoiseach said yesterday.

In terms of restrictions on household visits, it is believed restrictions could be lifted for Christmas week, with the focus more on personal choice and responsibility, rather than rigid recommendations on numbers.
However, the public will be asked to limit mingling to perhaps one main gathering during the Christmas period.
Inter-county travel will also be allowed so people can go home to see their friends and family. Mass and religious worship is also set to reopen.
“This Level 5 has been difficult, and the restrictions on households has been difficult on people. That has been very hard for people. We get that, we understand that.
“The good news is that what you are doing is working. We’re managing our hospitals in terms of ICU numbers and in terms of hospitalisation. We’ve kept our schools open.

GARDAÍ HAVE MET senior RTE officials as part of their inquiries into potential coronavirus rule breaches at a staff social gathering at the broadcaster.
Some of RTÉ’s most well-known presenters have apologised for breaching social distancing guidelines at a gathering for a retiring employee.
The broadcaster says the goodbye was a “short impromptu gathering” and that “social distancing was observed overall”. 
Garda inquiries are focusing on whether the gathering was in breach of coronavirus regulations prohibiting the organisation of indoor events involving more than two households.
Failing to socially distance or wear a mask at such an event is not an offence under the regulations.
Following the meeting, a garda spokesman said the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions would be sought on whether further action was required.
The chair of the the board of RTÉ said earlier today that the pictures pose a “serious concern”. 
Moya Doherty said that the national broadcaster must remain “above reproach” and that she and the board will be fully updated on the matter this week.
In a statement, Doherty said: “The failure to adhere to proper social distancing procedures at a recent gathering in RTÉ is a matter of serious concern.
“As has been already acknowledged by the individuals present, there is an onus on all of us in RTÉ to be both above reproach and to lead by example at this time of exceptional national challenge.”

Earlier, it emerged that RTÉ may be required to answer questions before an Oireachtas Committee over the social distancing controversy at the broadcaster.
RTÉ has said it is prepared to appear before members of the Oireachtas Communications Committee to answer questions about the event.
The incident is now being looked at by politicians with the Oireachtas Media Committee set to meet on Wednesday. Chair of the Committee, Niamh Smyth TD, said she does not accept that this was an impromptu event.
Smyth told Today with Claire Byrne that the committee has a responsibility to seek answers from RTÉ management as “something like that had to be organised”. 
The Fianna Fáil TD said Dee Forbes and management within RTÉ could be asked to appear before the committee in the coming weeks after the matter is discussed during a private session this Wednesday.
She expects the committee will “all be on the same page” about asking bosses to appear to give an explanation as to how this event came about as management has been slow to come forward and offer clarity to the public. 
“People in the public eye have to come out, be forthright, in not only the apology but the explanation as to why something like this would happen. 
“This undermines collective efforts being made nationally, in terms of the sacrifices people have had to make the length and breadth of this country.”
Speaking to reporters at Dublin Port this morning, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said that RTÉ has never been slow to appear before an Oireachtas committee, and an appearance there would be a “required follow-through”.
He noted that apologies issued so far have been genuine.

Committee member Senator Malcolm Byrne told TheJournal.ie this morning that part of the concern is that RTÉ management has not yet answered questions publicly on the incident. 
Numerous times in the past number of days the gathering has been spoken about on RTÉ airwaves but the audience was told that a spokesperson was not made available. 
“I don’t accept this thing that a spokesperson is not available,” Byrne says. 
“If it was Golfgate or the Bobby Story funeral there was an expectation that ministers or the Sinn Fein leadership would come out and give answers. Someone from RTÉ management should have come out. 
People make mistakes and the apologies that were given were sincere, so it’s not a case of getting heads to roll, it’s about coming out to give assurances that what happened won’t happen again. 
On Friday, secretary of the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) Seamus Dooley welcomed RTÉ’s apology but said the incident should not have happened and it potentially damaged RTÉ’s ability to hold others to account.
Yesterday, presenter Miriam O’Callaghan apologised on air for “letting everyone down” and her apology followed similar that were made on Friday by David McCullagh, Eileen Dunne and Bryan Dobson.

THE WHITE HOUSE is defying warnings by public health officials for Americans not to travel and to limit gatherings this holiday season amid a new surge in coronavirus cases, by planning a host of festivities which kicked off on Monday with the arrival of the White House Christmas tree.
“Attending the parties will be a very personal choice,” said Stephanie Grisham, first lady Melania Trump’s spokeswoman and chief of staff. “It is a longstanding tradition for people to visit and enjoy the cheer and iconic decor of the annual White House Christmas celebrations.”
The decision to move forward with indoor events and other gatherings comes as the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, senior White House advisers and public health professionals across the nation plead with Americans not to travel for Thanksgiving or spend the holiday with people from outside their households.
As the weather has cooled, the virus has been spreading out of control, with cases and hospital admissions surging across the nation and more than 250,000 people dead.
The White House has already been the site of several suspected “super-spreader” events and dozens of staff — along with the president, the first lady and their son — have been infected, along with a long list of campaign aides and other advisers.
Grisham said the White House would be taking precautions to provide “the safest environment possible” for attendees at events. That includes smaller guest lists, requiring masks, encouraging social distancing in the White House grounds and hand sanitiser stations placed throughout the State Floor.
“Guests will enjoy food individually plated by chefs at plexiglass-protected food stations. All passed beverages will be covered. All service staff will wear masks and gloves to comply with food safety guidelines,” she said.
Anthony Fauci, the nation’s senior infectious disease expert, warned again on Monday of the potentially dire consequences of gathering this holiday season.
“We’re in a very difficult situation where the rate of infection, the slope of infections, are really very, very steep. So you might want to reconsider travel plans,” he said.
He added that indoor holiday gatherings, “as innocent and wonderful as they sound”, should be kept to a minimal number of people, preferably “just members of a household” and also warned of a potential “surge superimposed upon a surge” if precautions are not taken.
Melania Trump receives the official White House Christmas tree.
Dr Fauci predicted the country could see “well over” 300,000 deaths by the end of the year “if we don’t we turn things around”.
US surgeon general Jerome Adams today repeatedly evaded questions about indoor holiday parties scheduled at the White House while calling other Americans’ indoor gatherings potential “super-spreader” events.

“I want the American people to know that we are at a dire point in our fight with this virus, by any measure: cases, positivity, hospitalisations, deaths,” he said.
“So I’m asking Americans — I’m begging you — hold on just a little bit longer. Keep Thanksgiving and the celebrations small and smart this year… do it outdoors if you can, keep it small, ideally less than 10, and prepare beforehand.
“These apply to the White House, they apply to the American people, they apply to everyone. We want you to stay safe so we can get to a vaccine.”
Not long after, the first lady attended a small ceremony to mark the arrival of the Christmas tree — by horse-drawn wagon — an event that traditionally kicks off the holidays at the White House.
Trump inspected the Fraser fir tree, smiled, waved to cameras and chatted with masked drivers as the brass section of the United States Marine Band played Christmas carols.
Events will continue tomorrow as Donald Trump participates in the annual pardoning of the National Thanksgiving Turkey at a ceremony in the Rose Garden.
He has remained largely behind closed doors since he lost his bid for re-election. He has refused to concede, lodging baseless allegations of voter fraud in an attempt to subvert the results.","Public health officials have pleaded with Americans not to travel for Thanksgiving or spend the holiday with people from outside their household.",1,0,0,36664,"17 hours ago"

WHO officials said it was down to governments to weigh up the economic and social benefits of loosening pandemic restrictions over the festive period, while individuals would have to decide whether they might be putting more vulnerable relatives at risk.
Many countries in Europe are battling rising coronavirus caseloads that are pushing health systems to the brink, forcing governments to issue stay-at-home orders and close businesses heading into the crucial Christmas period.
In Ireland, an announcement on an exit plan from Level 5 restrictions will be made on Thursday or Friday this week.
The Taoiseach Micheál Martin has made it clear previously that the country will move back to Level 3 restrictions at the start of next month, with possibly some “modifications” allowing non-essential retail to reopen in time for the Christmas trade.
Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s Covid-19 technical lead, said there were no “zero-risk” options this Christmas.
“There’s lower risk or higher risk – but there is a risk,” she told a virtual media briefing today.
“This is incredibly difficult because especially during holidays… we really want to be with family but in some situations, the difficult decision not to have that family gathering is the safest bet.”

She said everyone would have to take that decision for themselves, weighing up whether they could potentially be bringing the virus into the home of more vulnerable individuals with a higher risk of dying from the disease.
Van Kerkhove suggested that connecting virtually might be the way to go.
“Even if you can’t celebrate together this year, you can find ways to celebrate when this is all over,” she said.
We are doing that within our own family and we are going to have one heck of a celebration when this is all over.
‘Confidence and joy’
Mike Ryan, the WHO’s emergencies director, said there was a balance to be struck between the science and the economic and social factors.
Ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday in the United States, Ryan said that after Thanksgiving in Canada – celebrated this year on October 12 – transmission of the virus increased.
He said there was “no question” that in areas of significant community transmission, further opening up would result in increased transmission.
“The question is: have you got the disease under enough control to start with, and can you allow people a little bit more freedom over the Christmas period which generates a sense of confidence and joy in the community, which people need right now, without letting the virus let rip again?
“It’s a trade-off between these two issues,” he said.
Ryan said national policies were not as clear-cut as the science.
He said: “Each government will have to decide on its policy, based on those trade-offs between the epidemiologic risk versus the economic and social risk of continuing to have people in restricted situation over a holiday period, which will generate genuinely a lot frustration, further fatigue and a lot of pushback.”","“There’s lower risk or higher risk – but there is a risk,” Maria Van Kerkhove said.",22,0,0,28984,"17 hours ago"

Yesterday was one of those days for Cavan people across the world. The stuff of dreams, an absolute fairytale. Nothing more, nothing less. The only negative was not being there.
Celebrations in full flow after Cavan's win yesterday.

“I still can’t believe it — it’s like waking up from a dream. It’s what you dreamed about when you were younger… that’s all we wanted when we were younger. It was to lift the Ulster title, and I’m stuck for words.”
It’s hard to sum it up, but a few sentences from Padraig Faulkner went a long way in doing just that as the Breffni ended 23 years of hurt in Ulster with a huge four-point decider win over Donegal. As did Mickey Graham and Raymond Galligan’s tearful, off-the-cuff interviews with BBC. The raw emotion, the jubilant scenes at the final whistle, the moments that followed as Cavan celebrated the end of the famine.
Magic. Special. What it’s all about. If only you could bottle the feeling.
There’s no doubt about it, Graham’s men had been written off left, right and centre. Very few gave them a chance. But against all odds, the script was ripped up and torn to shreds at an empty Athletic Grounds, with Cavan’s name now set to be etched on the Anglo Celt Cup for the first time since 1997 — when Graham himself played.
Growing up, stories of ’97 were never too far away. Certainly not in my house, anyway. Stories of that sunny day in Clones when a 28-year wait for Ulster glory ended after dramatics at the death; stories of Jason Reilly’s goal, of Raymond Cunningham’s point, of Stephen King lifting the silverware.
Of how this was going to be the start of a new era. Until it wasn’t.
Yesterday was a long time coming. From falling just short time and time again to the blue wave of U21 success, to the infamous Black Death jibe; the past few years have been nothing short of a rollercoaster. Cavan is a proud footballing county that hasn’t always tasted the success. You don’t always get what you deserve in life, or in sport, but rewards were certainly reaped yesterday, the day of the underdog in Ulster and Munster.

And that’s a tag that suited Cavan just fine. What Graham did with Mullinalaghta, he could do again. The belief and hunger in the set-up was on another level this year despite the loss of some key players, and it only grew week on week after the restart.

Back-to-back league defeats, but ultimately a flurry of bad luck, saw Graham’s side relegated to Division 3 of the league. Six days later, they stunned Monaghan — genuine All-Ireland contenders in the eyes of many — on their home patch after extra-time; the now-legendary Thomas Galligan and his namesake, heroic goalkeeper and captain Raymond, leading the way as the Breffni came from eight down. Next up, a by-no-means pretty, but hard-fought, win over Antrim. Then, a dramatic come-from-10-points-behind triumph over Down to send them back to the Ulster final for the second consecutive year (the 2019 final appearance was their first in 18 years, but we all know how that went.)
And Cavan’s most complete performance would arrive when they needed it most: on the big stage against hot favourites Donegal. Galligan’s colossal, Lazarus-like display. McKiernan’s ever-presence. The mammoth defensive effort. The will, the want, the desire. Madden’s stoppage-time goal. Kiernan’s exquisite point just before it. Galligan’s save even before that. The two controversial black cards that almost derailed the bid entirely. Referee Barry Cassidy, in general.
Cavan had it all to do on the day, the odds stacked against them. On a day which was the 68-year anniversary of the death of ‘The Gallant John Joe.’ On a day which was exactly 95 years on from the late Edward O’Hanlon first presenting the Anglo Celt Cup. On a day where the 1920 semi-final pairings were repeated, 100 years on from Bloody Sunday. And on a weekend which the county’s camógs incredibly reached an All-Ireland final in their comeback year.
All to do, but Cavan did it. And they did it for everyone back home.
It’s no secret that the county has been ravaged by Covid-19 and other tragedies over the past few months. 2020 has been a difficult year for everyone across the length and breadth of the country and around the globe, but a real cloud of sadness has hung over Cavan as several young lives were lost suddenly, compounding the virus sadness.
This win is about so much more than sport. Yes, it’s a coveted Ulster title, something many would bite your hand off for. But it’s hope, happiness and joy in a time of despair; epitomised by the scenes of the drive-thru celebrations at Breffni Park last night; by the cars proudly parading around towns, beeping for one and all to hear; by the endless videos of proud Cavan men, women and children alike crying at the final whistle.
It’s light in the darkness, and inspiration for the next generation. A generation for which stories of 2020 will surely never be too far away.
Sometimes in life, things just mean more.

€104 million was paid out for the PUP this week by the Department of Social Protection, with more than €4.3 billion in payments issued since it was introduced earlier this year. 
The sector with the highest number of people in receipt of the payment is accommodation and food service activities, with over 102,000 people. 
This is followed by wholesale and retail trade (57,292 people) and sectors like hairdressers and beauty salons (31,273). 
There are 352,078 people in receipt of the payment in total this week. 
The Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys said the government hopes to consider easing Covid-19 restrictions from early December.
She said this would “hopefully allow some people to return to work”.
“These past few weeks have not been easy. I know people are tired and just want life to get back to some normality,” Humphreys said in a statement. 
The Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said the plan to exit Level 5 restrictions from next week will be made public “either Thursday or Friday” this week. 
Speaking to reporters earlier today, Martin said coalition leaders will meet tonight and a full Cabinet meeting will be held tomorrow morning.

He added that “no decisions have been made as yet” regarding the restrictions in place from 2 December onwards.

Michael J Fox
Actor Michael J Fox went public a number of years ago with his diagnosis of early-onset Parkinson’s disease. He says that he believes he is a lucky man, and in this interview talks about how that diagnosis affected him.
(The Guardian, approx 17 mins reading time)
Being diagnosed at the heartbreakingly young age of 29 had also knocked the ego out of his career ambitions, so he could do smaller things he was proud of – Stuart Little, the TV sitcom Spin City – as opposed to the big 90s comedies, such as Doc Hollywood, that were too often a waste of his talents. To be honest, I didn’t entirely buy his tidy silver linings, but who was I to cast doubt on whatever perspective Fox had developed to make a monstrously unjust situation more bearable? So the sudden dose of pragmatism astonished me. Finding a cure for Parkinson’s, he said, “is not something that I view will happen in my lifetime”. Previously, he had talked about finding “a cure within a decade”. No more. “That’s just the way it goes,” he said quietly. It was like a dark cloud had partly obscured the sun.

300,198,"Woman who was raped as a child wins legal battle to name her attacker",https://www.thejournal.ie/rape-victims-wins-legal-battle-to-name-attacker-declan-hannon-5276646-Nov2020/,"A WOMAN WHO was raped as a child has successfully won an 18 month legal battle to have her rapist named after a court made a gagging order preventing him from being identified, in case that identified her. 
Declan Hannon (50) first raped the nine year old child during a game of hide and seek when he was aged 17. He raped the child three more times during the summer in around 1987 or 1989.
The woman, now aged in her 40s, gave evidence six times in court before the offender was finally convicted and subsequently jailed for seven years.
She came forward to make a statement in 2013 and there were a number of trials which collapsed before Hannon of Ramsgate Village, Gorey, Co Wexford was convicted by a jury after a trial at the Central Criminal Court in March 2019.
He had pleaded not guilty to four counts of rape and two counts of indecent assault on dates between 1987 and 1989.
This is the first time the full details of his sentence hearing at the Central Criminal Court in May 2019 can be published because of a gagging order imposed by Justice Micheal White during the trial.
The order prevented the publication of the both the victim and her abuser. In a judgement today the Court of Appeal ruled that this order “was superfluous and ought not to have been made”.
Justice White said that he made his order “at the request of the DPP and the complainant”.
Lawyers for the DPP appealed the gagging order after the victim contacted them to say she wished to waive her anonymity and for Hannon to be named. In response Hannon made applications to the court submitting the victim had no legal right to waive her anonymity.
Speaking outside of court in 2019 the victim said she was never asked by the DPP at the sentencing hearing about her wishes and did not know she had to address the question of her anonymity.
A separate landmark decision which prevents child victims of crime being named means her name cannot be published, despite her indicating her wish for this to happen, unless and until a court rules on the matter. 
In her victim impact statement the woman, now a married mother, said she had to think long and hard about coming forward when she was approached by gardaí in 2013.
She said she had tucked away the horror of what had happened but ultimately decided to come forward “to right this horrible wrong.”
She described how she was a witness in the long court process with no legal representation or guidance and had to remind herself not to get her hopes up as there was the potential for it all to go wrong.
“All I had was the truth and the knowledge I was doing the right thing,” she told the court.
“You had the opportunity to prevent all this by taking responsibility but again chose the hurtful path of deception….you rolled the dice at our expense and rightfully lost,” she told Hannon.

She said there had been reference during the court case to delay in coming forward, but she said having been through the trial process now, she knows they did the right thing and that her mother had protected her from the trauma of a court case as a child.
“I will never forget what has been done for me to finally have justice, peace and closure,” she said.
In sentencing, Mr Justice White said that Hannon carried the brutal and cynical rape of an innocent child. He set a headline sentence of 11 years.
He reduced this to seven after taking into consideration the fact that he had led a “constructive and exemplary life” since this offending.
Mr Justice White paid tribute to the “exceptional courage” of the victim who he noted had to give evidence on six occasions during the legal process.
“She showed exceptional courage in the way she comported herself throughout this process,” he said. He said the court was very conscious that serious sexual abuse during childhood affected a person throughout their life.
He commended the woman for conquering these issues and living a normal life.","Declan Hannon, 50, of Gorey, Co Wexford can now be named after a judgement by the Court of Appeal today.",11,0,0,50137,"19 hours ago"
301,199,"'I was an absolute emotional wreck, from laughing to nearly breaking down in tears' - Tipperary's day of glory",https://www.the42.ie/brian-fox-tipperary-football-5276507-Nov2020/,"EMOTIONS RAN HIGH on a November Sunday.
It was that kind of afternoon, whether you were playing in the heat of the arena in Páirc Uí Chaoimh or watching on from a living room in West Tipperary, nerves fraying with each passing minute.
A collective wait of over eight decades hung over Tipperary football. Brian Fox had journeyed through a chunk of that struggle and disappointment.
When the final whistle blasted in the stadium yesterday, it confirmed he was a Munster senior football champion in his 13th season of membership of the Tipperary squad.
On this 2020 weekend where the air was thick with historical memories, that moment of success over Cork hit Fox hard.
“I’ll tell you now I was an absolute emotional wreck at the end of it. I went from laughing to nearly breaking down in tears, cheering and running. I was all over the shop, I just couldn’t control my emotions.
“The whole week there’d be a huge build up. While you try and block out the outside noise about the jerseys and the commemoration stuff, it does take its’ toll on you emotionally. It plays on your mind.
“When you are older, you do appreciate what you’ve been through. In those moments after the final whistle when you are out there and you look at the lad beside you who you’re after soldiering with for so long. Myself and Philly (Austin), we had a good moment after the game, just the realisation that, ‘Yeah this is it like.’

Back home they were glued to the TV coverage. His wife Siobhan trying to follow the match with three-year-old son Tadhg and six-month-old daughter Lilly for company.
Amidst the celebrations of this landmark occasion, the tinge of regret for Fox was the empty stands and terraces around him on Leeside.
“Siobhan told me today she didn’t get to see the last ten minutes at all really. Our youngest started crying because the rest of the family were making so much noise.
“Not having your family there to congratulate you or commiserate with you, that’s a huge thing. I know my family were nervous wrecks up here in Tipperary. They would have only loved to have been there. They’re the reason you play.
“My wife and I have spoken about it, it’s tough. Tadhg, he’s at an age where you’d love for him to be on the pitch and be able to bring him in your arms around the place. But you don’t get the moments.
“My family are very good, my parents, all my cousins would be very good to support and go to all the matches. Not to have them there is very tough because they’re there in all the bad moments, it’d be great to share the good moments with them.”
Fox’s involvement represents a triumph for perseverance. If Tipperary’s football narrative has been viewed as one of gradual progress, fuelled by underage statements, then his personal career story is different.
The 32-year-old played in his sixth Munster football final yesterday. The previous five all generated the same outcome. It started off at minor level in 2006 against Kerry. Then a trio of U21 deciders between 2007 and 2009. He fired 1-1 against Kerry in ’08, then the last of that sequence particularly stung when he shot 1-2, claimed the man-of-the-match award but saw his team agonisingly caught at the line by a last-gasp Cork goal.

In 2016 they recorded a first senior championship victory over Cork in 72 years to reach a final but Kerry’s prowess meant it was a familiar feeling for Fox. Tasting defeat and wondering if he would ever add a provincial medal for his efforts to an honours list that only contained a couple of Division 3 league accolades.
This was a gigantic step forward. Opponents Cork had been frequent foes and Fox needed little reminding of the high stakes at play.
“We knew them so well and we’ve always been very competitive. From that aspect we didn’t fear them and we said this is the opportunity to go do it. There’s no hoping another opportunity arises. When we saw Cork beat Kerry, we knew we’d never have a better chance.
“For the older lads, we were just hungry full stop because we’ve never tasted that success. You made progress but it’s different when you don’t have a cup to show for it.”

For himself and Austin, the oldest player on the panel who kicked a point with his very first touch, this was the day they had long craved. Others like defensive pair Alan Campbell and Robbie Kiely, and their captain Conor Sweeney had soldiered for several seasons in the trenches as well with little reward.

Watching players file out of the dressing-room in recent years for the last time gave Fox pause for thought.
“I wouldn’t see others move on and think, ‘Jesus I have to move on.’ When your responsibilty grows in work and at home, that’s when you start thinking about, maybe that it’s time to give it over to a younger generation.
“As long as I have the energy in the legs and I feel I can give something to Tipperary, then I’d always love to put on the jersey.”
He’s the only parent on the Tipperary panel, a position of responsibility that marks a contrast to the youthful figures in their group.
“The younger lads, some of the stuff they’d be on about, I haven’t a clue,” he laughs.
“They’re living in a totally different planet to what I grew up in. They can’t even I’d say get over the fact that I have kids. I’d say my three-year-old is more mature than some of them at times!”
They’re at different stages of life but the shutdown of activity last spring and summer, that sudden loss of something so central to his routine, was hard to adjust to.

“It was challenging. You’re with fellas for seven or eight months, they’re your friends and then you don’t get to meet them at all. You try to do Zooms to keep the camraderie going but it is difficult. At the end of the day the reason you’re all friends is because you’re playing elite level sport together and you have that common bond as a result. I found lockdown quite tough in that regard, not being able to train as a group and meet up with the lads.”
They got the gang back together in the autumn and hit the inter-county trail once more. Momentum started to build. This month in the space of 22 days, they took off. Getting past Clare by three, prevailing against Limerick after extra-time with Fox lofting over the winner and rounding it off against Cork.

It is a county where hurling largely holds sway, his uncle Pat was one of the county’s most decorated forwards. But this struck a blow for football, back in Annacarty and Donohill they toasted their local hero. The well wishes poured in from plenty other quarters as well.
“For a small club, we’ve punched above our weight. Conor and my cousin Tom and Darragh Mooney have All-Ireland medals, Pat before them.
“My brother Kevin, Paud O’Dwyer my cousin, Eoin Kennedy all have U21 Munster medals with Tipperary. They’d often say it that football wise it has been tough for a long time. We are predominantly a hurling club but they understand how passionate I am about it.
“The lads were all sending messages last night and you really appreciate them. We were all speaking in the squad about last how much of a crowd would have come out and met us if we had crossed the border into Tipp and there wasn’t Covid.
“It meant a lot to a lot of people. My phone still hasn’t stopped hopping. I’m trying to respond to people that’d be huge into Tipp football and would have always supported me. They’re a real tight-knit group. I haven’t got back to all of them yet, I will get onto them though. I’ll have some size of a phone bill this winter!”

Fox never completely lost hope of Tipperary realising their ambitions yet recent times had tested his reserves of belief.
“’18 and ’19 were hugely disappointing. Last year I think we only won one game. Losing to Limerick and the manner in which we lost, put a real dampener everything. You just felt all the progress that had been made up to that point seemed to be just fading.
“Key players had left the squad, George, Peter Acheson, Ciarán, Mikey we knew was going travelling. It looked like we were going down a path where we wouldn’t be able to compete at the top level which is what we wanted to do.”
In March 2018 they took on Cavan in a league promotion decider to determine which of the pair would join the elite in Division 1. The home side won by a point that day in Breffni Park, both themselves and Tipperary ploughed through lean times thereafter. Then remarkably they both came in from the provincial wilderness on the same Sunday, sparking wild outbreaks of joy.
This morning Fox was back teaching in St Anne’s secondary school in Tipperary Town. The other teachers met him outside, saluting at a distance during the post-match chatter. Students wore their Tipperary colours.
The success has lifted the mood. Now thoughts turn to early December in Croke Park, Mayo the obstacle as they chase an All-Ireland final place.
“I think the stars aligned. I’m a full believer in self-fulfilling prophecy, people sometimes believes things repeat themselves and sometimes they do. Others get the fear and others take great hope from it.
“Mayo are a fantastic team but we’ve always battled hard against them. Sure the dream is to be in an All-Ireland final and sure if we’ve to beat Mayo to do it, that’s what we’ll try and do.”

The nomination of the former secretary of state comes as Biden continues to build out his administration with key picks for national security and foreign policy roles.
Other planned nominations include Alejandro Mayorkas as the secretary for the department of homeland security and Antony Blinken as Biden’s secretary of state, according to multiple people familiar with the Biden team’s planning.
Blinken, 58, served as deputy secretary of state and deputy national security adviser during the Obama administration and has close ties with Biden.
If nominated and confirmed, he would be a leading force in the incoming administration’s bid to reframe the US relationship with the rest of the world after four years in which Donald Trump questioned long-time alliances.
In nominating Blinken, Biden would sidestep potentially thorny issues that could have affected Senate confirmation for two other candidates on his shortlist to be America’s top diplomat: Susan Rice and Senator Chris Coons.
Rice would have faced significant Republican opposition and likely rejection in the Senate. She has long been a target of Republicans, including for statements she made after the deadly 2012 attacks on Americans in Benghazi, Libya.
Coons, a member of the Senate foreign relations committee, lacked the experience in managing day-to-day foreign policy issues that Blinken would bring to the job.
Biden is likely to name his cabinet picks in tranches, with groups of nominees focused on a specific top area, like the economy, national security or public health, being announced at once. Advisers to the president-elect’s transition have said they’ll make their first cabinet announcements tomorrow.
If Biden focuses on national security that day, Michele Flournoy, a veteran of Pentagon policy jobs, is a top choice to lead the defence department.

Jake Sullivan, a long-time adviser to Biden and Hillary Clinton, is also in the mix for a top job, including White House national security adviser.
For his part, Blinken recently participated in a national security briefing with Biden and vice president-elect Kamala Harris and has weighed in publicly on notable foreign policy issues in Egypt and Ethiopia.

The flu vaccine is currently available for free to children aged 2-12, and community pharmacists believe this should be expanded to include 13-17-year olds also.
The uptake of the nasal flu vaccine has reportedly been low, and there is a risk that a significant portion of the 600,000 vaccines for children which were ordered by the HSE could expire unused due to a lack of demand.
The IPU said it understands the vaccines will begin to expire in January and while 450,000 have been distributed, so far only about one quarter are recorded as having been administered.
A statement from the IPU urged parents to ensure their children get vaccinated.
Community pharmacist and IPU committee member Jonathon Morrissey said, “Flu is a very serious and contagious respiratory illness. While it disproportionately affects older people, it is deeply unpleasant at all ages and can have serious long-term impacts.

“It is very concerning that there has been such a low uptake in parents getting their children vaccinated, despite a very high-profile campaign by the HSE advertising that the vaccine is available for free to children.”
Morrissey added that if there is a possibility that doses of the nasal flu vaccine could expire unused, then the criteria to qualify for the free vaccine should be expanded to include all those over 2, and up to 18.
“We currently can’t stop COVID-19 but we can stop flu. We should all do what we can to protect our health service and the vulnerable members of our community.

The idea is that social welfare would be denied to people who don’t get a Covid-19 vaccine. 
This is not true and has been confirmed as false by the relevant government department. 
The claim 
False claim about a 'vaccination passport'.
The post shared on Facebook features an image containing the government’s yellow Covid-19 logo used in official posters and imagery related to the pandemic. 
The text in the image reads: “Please have your vaccination passport ready for collecting social welfare.” 
It claims that people will require evidence of having received a Covid-19 vaccine in order to collect social welfare. 
One post with this image and claim has been shared more than 150 times on Facebook with over 300 comments. 
Another post making this claim has been shared more than 130 times. 
The Department of Social Protection (DEASP) is responsible for social welfare in Ireland.  
In a statement issued to TheJournal.ie about this issue, the department said: “We can confirm that this message is incorrect and did not issue from the Department of Social Protection.”
Additionally, while a number of clinical trials have been shown to be successful in recent weeks, there is no Covid-19 vaccine currently available. 
Taoiseach Micheál Martin said a strategy for the rollout of a vaccine will be presented to Government by 11 December. Martin said earlier this month that a vaccine should be available to the general public by the middle of next year, and earlier than that for priority groups. 
The government has not indicated that the Covid-19 vaccine would be mandatory for the population. 
Additionally, there has been no suggestion from any member of government or NPHET that vaccinations should be linked to social welfare. The claim has solely been made in social media posts pedalling conspiracy theories. 
Immunisation passports
Although this claim about a vaccination passport is incorrect, immunisation passports do exist but are not used in the same way as a regular passport. 
These are simply booklets which include details of vaccines you have received. 
The HSE has an immunisation passport booklet available online. It advises people to bring the booklets to any vaccine appointments. 
There has been a lot of misinformation surrounding vaccines throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.
Vaccines are not compulsory in Ireland but are strongly advised by the Department of Health. Parental consent is required for vaccines for children up to the age of 16.

A 2018 study of the vaccination policies in 31 European countries showed that over one-third have at least some mandatory vaccinations in place. This is the case in countries like Italy, France and Poland, but not in Ireland. 
However, there has been some discussion of the issue in the past. Last year, the then-Minister for Health Simon Harris said he received preliminary advice from the Attorney General regarding mandatory vaccination in Ireland. 
In terms of a Covid-19 vaccination passport, the Department of Social Welfare said these will not be used to cut off social welfare payments from people who are not vaccinated.

There is a lot of false news and scaremongering being spread in Ireland at the moment about coronavirus. Here are some practical ways for you to assess whether the messages that you’re seeing – especially on WhatsApp – are true or not. 
STOP, THINK AND CHECK 
Look at where it’s coming from. Is it someone you know? Do they have a source for the information (e.g. the HSE website) or are they just saying that the information comes from someone they know? A lot of the false news being spread right now is from people claiming that messages from ‘a friend’ of theirs. Have a look yourself – do a quick Google search and see if the information is being reported elsewhere. 
Secondly, get the whole story, not just a headline. A lot of these messages have got vague information (“all the doctors at this hospital are panicking”) and don’t mention specific details. This is often – but not always a sign – that it may not be accurate. 
Finally, see how you feel after reading it. A lot of these false messages are designed to make people feel panicked. They’re deliberately manipulating your feelings to make you more likely to share it. If you feel panicked after reading something, check it out and see if it really is true.

It is understood Minister for Justice Helen McEntee is to seek Cabinet approval tomorrow for new offences to deal with the non-consensual distribution of intimate images.
The move comes only a couple of days after the gardaí confirmed they are investigating the uploading of images and videos of Irish women and girls, without their consent, to a number of online forums.
It is understood that some of the images and footage are of minors. 
The Victims Alliance, an advocacy group, said tens of thousands of images have been shared on various online platforms.
Last week, the minister said in the Dáil that anyone sharing intimate images of a person without their consent “will face serious criminal sanctions”.
Under the minister’s proposals, the first offence will deal with the distribution or publication of intimate images without consent and with intent to cause harm.
It is intended to carry a maximum penalty of an unlimited fine and/or seven years imprisonment.
The second offence will deal with the taking, distribution or publication of intimate images without consent without a requirement that the person intended to cause harm to the victim of the offence.
It is intended that this offence will carry a maximum penalty of a €5,000 fine and/or 12 months imprisonment.

Gardaí looking into allegations that large number of images of women were shared online without their consent
It is understood that the fact that the person may have consented to the taking of an image will be irrelevant if it is subsequently published or distributed without their consent.
The Bill does not specify the types of technology that may be used to commit the offences, and is intentionally neutral to cover all forms of online and offline communications that cause harm to a victim.
It will also be an aggravating factor for the purposes of sentencing if the perpetrator of the offence is or was in an intimate relationship with the victim of the offence.
The new measures will be contained in amendments to the Harassment, Harmful Communications and other Related Offences Bill. 
An update on the harassment legislation will also broaden the scope of the offence of harassment to cover consistent communications to or about a person, not just indecent images, and increasing the penalty from seven to ten years to reflect the harm that can be caused by most serious forms of harassment.
The maximum penalty will be increased from seven years to 10 years to reflect the harm caused by the most serious forms of harassment.

309,201,"Opinion: There's no point asking employees to 'work from home' when employers hold all the cards",https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/remote-working-workers-rights-nphet-5276412-Nov2020/,"DEVELOPMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY and its widespread availability have made it possible for many jobs to be performed outside of the employer’s premises. However, it took a pandemic to fully awaken us to the potential for homeworking. 
Before Covid-19 struck, just under one in 20 (4.9%) employees worked mainly from home. In policy circles, homeworking was viewed as one in a suite of flexible working arrangements for attracting and retaining mothers, carers and people with a disability in the workforce. 
With the arrival of Covid-19, working from home went mainstream. Over a matter of days, tens of thousands of businesses moved their staff to remote working to help slow the spread of the virus.
Around 40% of paid hours worked in the economy during lockdown were performed from homes around the country as the number of remote workers skyrocketed to more than one in four (27.6%) of those in employment.
The future of work is now
For some employees, the experience of working from home has been fraught. Unsuitable accommodation, poor broadband, longer hours, feeling isolated are among the top issues raised with union reps.
But, for the vast majority, it has been a positive experience and they want to continue working from home after the Covid-19 restrictions end. 
Unsurprising, remote working has become a hot topic for radio and tv programmes and newspaper think pieces, with many predicting the death of the office. This conclusion is not supported by opinion poll findings and what we are hearing from our members – the overwhelming preference is for a mix of office-based and homeworking post-pandemic. 
So, while unions view the reports of the death of the office to be greatly exaggerated, we do recognise the potential for remote working to be one of the great disruptors to the workplace, similar to the arrival of the assembly line on to the factory floor and the personal computer into the office.  
To be clear, trade unions are not looking to hold back the tide of progress. There is a huge appetite for remote working among our members. When implemented in the right way, working from home or remotely from another location, such as a digital hub or co-working space, can really improve workers’ work-life balance, make them happier and more productive.
Our focus is on ensuring workers’ hard-won rights are preserved when working from home and that protections keep pace with changes in ways of working.
However, while workers are willing to embrace this future of work, and as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has been to the fore in highlighting, under Irish law they have no rights to work from home.

The power imbalance
In the UK, Northern Ireland and across the EU, workers who have completed their probation period have a right to request homeworking and their employer is legally required to give their request serious consideration. 
There is no obligation on the employer to agree to the request. Not all jobs can be completed remotely and the need for flexibility must be balanced with the needs of the business.
Here in Ireland, working from home and other flexible working arrangements – flexi-time, part-time hours, job-share, etc – are wholly at the discretion of the employer.
Without a statutory requirement to give requests reasonable consideration, Irish employers have shown themselves to be too quick to out of hand refuse to negotiate a work from home company policy with trade union reps, prior to Covid. 
Equally today, datasets on people’s movements show large numbers of workers are back in the workplace, in spite of public health advice to work from home unless absolutely necessary to attend in person.
The message on working from home is ‘not getting through’ said Dr Tony Holohan, the chief medical officer, last Thursday. This message needs to be targeted at employers, who hold all the power when it comes to workers’ place of work.
The homeworking genie is out of the bottle
A new EU Directive on Work-Life Balance requires Government to give carers and parents of young children the right to request remote working by 2022, in line with European workers’ rights.

The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has called on Government to go beyond the minimum requirements of the directive and extend this right to all workers. 
The past eight months have been a mass experiment in homeworking. Granted, the experiment conditions have been far from textbook. No one would have designed it to be implemented overnight, without time to set-up, and for it to run in parallel with a public health emergency. 
Even so, workers and policymakers are now very much alive to its potential. In the next few weeks, Government will publish its National Strategy on Remote Working. Introducing rights to remote working and stronger protections for homeworkers will be key to getting buy-in from reluctant employers and for a smooth transition in this cultural shift in how we work.

311,189,"Corruption trial suspended for former French president Nicolas Sarkozy",https://www.thejournal.ie/former-french-president-sarkozy-goes-on-trial-on-charges-of-corruption-5275950-Nov2020/,"Updated 23 hours ago
THE CORRUPTION TRIAL of former French president Nicolas Sarkozy was suspended after less than two hours to allow for a medical report on one of the defendants.
Sarkozy faces charges of corruption and influence peddling after the accusation he tried to illegally obtain information from a magistrate about an investigation involving him in 2014.
This is the first trial for the 65-year-old politician, who has faced several other judicial investigations since leaving office in 2012.
He stands trial in Paris along with his lawyer Thierry Herzog (65) and the magistrate, Gilbert Azibert (73).
They face a prison sentence of up to 10 years and a maximum fine of €1 million. They deny any wrongdoing.
Sarkozy and Herzog are suspected of promising Azibert a job in Monaco in exchange for leaking information about an investigation into suspected illegal financing of the 2007 presidential campaign by France’s richest woman, L’Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt.
Sarkozy arrived at the court surrounded by his lawyers and bodyguards, in the presence of dozens of journalists.
The Paris court has been placed under high security as hearings in the case, scheduled until December 10, are taking place at the same time as another key trial — that of the 2015 attacks at the Charlie Hebdo offices and a kosher supermarket.
The trial started today in the absence of Azibert, whose lawyer requested the hearings to be postponed. He argued his client’s bad health makes it risky for him to travel and appear in court amid the coronavirus pandemic, leading the court to suspend proceedings pending an expert medical report. The trial will resume on Thursday.
2014
In 2014, Sarkozy and Herzog used secret mobile phones – registered under the alias “Paul Bismuth” – in order to have private talks, as they feared their conversations were being tapped.
Sarkozy and Herzog explained that they bought the phones to avoid being targeted by illegal phone tapping. Investigative judges, however, suspect they actually wanted to avoid being tapped by investigators.
Judges have found that discussions between Sarkozy and his lawyer suggested they had knowledge that judicial investigators at the time tapped their conversations on their official phones, as they mentioned “judges listening”.
Sarkozy argued that he had never intervened to help Azibert, who never got the job and retired in 2014.
Investigative judges consider that as soon as a deal has been offered, it constitutes a criminal offence even if the promises have not been fulfilled.
Legal proceedings against Sarkozy have been dropped in the Bettencourt case.
Sarkozy has claimed judicial harassment, accusing judges of breaching lawyer-client privilege via wire-tapping.
“I don’t want things that I didn’t do to be held against me. The French need to know… that I’m not a rotten person,” he told news broadcaster BFM earlier this month.
He said he was facing the trial in a “combative” mood.
Sarkozy’s predecessor, Jacques Chirac, was found guilty in 2011 of misuse of public money, breach of trust and conflict of interest and given a two-year suspended prison sentence for actions during his time as Paris mayor, before he was president from 1995 to 2007.
Sarkozy’s name has appeared for years in several other judicial investigations.
Allegations, which include illegal financing of his 2007 campaign by then-Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, cast a shadow over Sarkozy’s comeback attempt for the 2017 presidential election.

After failing to be chosen as a candidate by his conservative party, he withdrew from active politics.
Sarkozy remains the most popular figure amid French right-wing voters in recent years. His memoirs published this summer, The Time Of Storms, was a bestseller for weeks.
He was handed preliminary charges including “illegal campaign financing” in the Libyan investigation, which has been under way since 2013 — and prompted the wire-tapping of his phones.
Earlier this month, French-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine retracted his previous statements that he delivered suitcases from Libya containing €5 million in cash to Sarkozy and his former chief of staff, Claude Gueant.
Instead, he told news broadcaster BFM and magazine Paris-Match that there was “no Libyan financing”.
Sarkozy said that the truth “finally comes out”.
Meanwhile, the former president will stand another trial in spring 2021 along with 13 other people on charges of illegal financing of his 2012 presidential campaign.
His conservative party and a company named Bygmalion are accused of using a special invoice system to conceal unauthorised overspending.
They are suspected of having spent €42.8 million, almost twice the maximum amount authorised, to finance the campaign, which ended up in victory for Sarkozy’s Socialist rival Francois Hollande.","The trial will resume on Thursday.",5,0,0,29285,"Mon 9:33 AM"

As the lockdown ends on 2 December, more parts of England are expected to be placed into higher tiers than they were before the national restrictions were imposed.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson also said the new tiers would be tougher than their predecessors, after government scientific advisers said the previous regime did not do enough to tackle the virus.
The announcement of the new measures came as the Oxford-AstraZeneca team announced its vaccine had proved 70% effective.
Appearing via video link from  coronavirus self-isolation in Downing Street, Johnson told MPs the three-tiered approach had been beefed up.
Under the new system:
– In Tier 2, alcohol may only be served in hospitality settings as part of a substantial meal.
– In Tier 3, pubs and restaurants will only be able to offer takeaway and delivery services, while indoor entertainment, hotels and other accommodation will close.
The 10pm curfew will be relaxed, with last orders now closed at that time and premises ordered to shut at 11pm.
Setting out other measures that will be eased as the lockdown lifts, Johnson said: “From next Wednesday people will be able to leave their home for any purpose and meet others in outdoor public spaces, subject to the rule of six, collective worship, weddings and outdoor sports can resume, and shops, personal care, gyms and the wider leisure sector can reopen.

Zuma left the commission hearing without permission after Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo dismissed an application asking him to recuse himself as chairman of the inquiry.
Zuma alleges Zondo is biased against him.
Zuma has been asked to respond to various allegations implicating him from at least 35 affidavits by witnesses who have appeared before the commission.
These include allegations, among others, that he was involved in ensuring that members of the controversial Gupta family secured lucrative state contracts and influenced his appointments of cabinet ministers.
Zondo announced today that he would also file an application to the Constitutional Court, the highest court in the country, to enforce a summons issued against Zuma and compel him to appear before the commission.
Judge Raymond Zondo
Zuma appeared before the commission last week for the first time in over a year after abandoning his evidence at the inquiry in 2019.

His lawyer Muzi Sikhakhane SC told the commission that Zuma would appeal against Zondo’s decision to dismiss his application, and would also file a complaint with the Judicial Services Commission, a statutory judicial regulatory body, against Judge Zondo for presiding over a matter involving himself.
Zuma’s legal steps against the commission and its chairman are widely seen as delay tactics to avoid facing questions about his role in corruption and state capture allegations that occurred largely from 2009 to 2018.
The criminal complaint will add to Zuma’s legal woes, which include corruption charges related to the country’s 1999 arms procurement deal in which he is accused of receiving bribes and for which he will possibly stand trial in 2021.","The former head of state walked out of an inquiry investigating alleged corruption.",1,0,0,11601,"23 hours ago"

THE LEVEL 5 exit plan will be decided and made public “either Thursday or Friday”, Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said.
Speaking to reporters at Dublin Port today, he said coalition leaders are set to meet tonight, while a full Cabinet will be held tomorrow morning.
He said that “no decisions have been made as yet” as to exactly what restrictions will follow Level 5.
The Taoiseach said there will be meetings with the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and Covid-19 subcommittee this week, with an announcement later this week.
“We will engage with NPHET and I’ve been in touch with the Chief Medical Officer.  NPHET obviously will give its advice but government will decide how we exit Level 5 and that will be a decision of government that will be taken this week, either towards Thursday or Friday,” he said.  
Ireland’s Level 5 restrictions are set to come to an end on Tuesday next week, 1 December, and the government is set to decide later this week what will be implemented to replace them.
Martin said Level 3 and Level 5 restrictions have worked, saying that the narrative stating otherwise recently is not helpful. The numbers have come “way down”, he said, adding that he wants them to drop further in the coming days.
The Taoiseach said that the government would have to “bear in mind” the effect that household visitor restrictions had on stemming the spread of the virus. 
“What has emerged is that the restriction of visitors to households, after we had introduced Level 3, seems to have had an impact. So we have to bear that in mind,” he said.  
Martin added the government will be looking at international evidence as well as the Irish experience about how best to plot a course forward. 
“We have looked at a lot of research on this, we’ve looked at what happened from August, September, October, we looked at international data. There are super spreader events, gatherings and congregation facilitate the spread of the virus. Gatherings and congregation with events with alcohol facilitate the spread of the virus. Ultimately, vigilance is key, human behaviour is key,” he said.

The Taoiseach would not speculate on specific sectors and whether they might re-open, but sounded positive about exiting Level Five next week.
“I haven’t made any specific comment in relation to any specific sector or any specific area or sub sector so that will be a matter for government to consider,” he said.  
He added that he would not “go into specifics” about what and wouldn’t be open. 
“Suffice to say that the Irish people have made a lot of sacrifices. And this Level 5 has been difficult, and the restriction on households has been difficult for people. And we get that we understand that. But the good news is that what you were doing is working,” he said. 
Christmas
At today’s regular leaders’ meeting, the three-party leaders will be continuing discussions on what the country will look like over the Christmas period.
NPHET had previously indicated that it was targeting an average number of daily Covid-19 cases in and around 100 when the six-week lockdown ended but at present, the average is 360.
Martin has made it clear previously that the country will move back to Level 3 restrictions, with possibly some “modifications”, from 1 December, allowing non-essential retail to reopen in time for the Christmas trade. 
What those modifications are are yet to be decided but he has cast doubt on whether wet pubs would reopen.
His comments come after Minister of State Pippa Hackett said that people needed to “buckle down” for the next few weeks and warned that a Christmas “free-for-all” could lead to another lockdown in the new year. 
Hackett said it is difficult for the government to provide certainty for businesses, but that they did not want a situation where they could reopen before Christmas and be forced to close again.
She acknowledged that there is a “deep frustration” among publicans and restauranteurs about the ongoing restrictions but they still cannot open.

There have been increasing calls from Opposition parties, as well as businesses for clarity around what will happen in December.
In an open letter to the Taoiseach, nearly 500 businesses in the hospitality and tourism sector called on the government to give them an opportunity to reopen, or open to a greater extent next month. 
The industry signatories criticised the country’s response to Covid-19, which they say has hit parts of the economy like the hospitality and experience sector disproportionality and “without sufficient evidence” to back such moves.
The letter says that the ability to open in a sustained manner, with restrictions, from December will give them what could be a “final lifeline” for many in the sector.
The letter also claims the sector can play a crucial role in the economic recovery after the pandemic, but that “won’t be the case if many of these businesses are forced to permanently shut their doors”.
These businesses will work hard to ensure everyone is kept safe, operating to the strict guidelines set down by Government, whilst also importantly giving people the opportunity to connect with the people they love, in the place they love.
CEO of the Vintners Federation Padraig Cribben told Morning Ireland that the industry needs all pubs to be reopened for indoor, drinking, and dining, no distinction between the different types of pubs, and that the restrictions that would be in place would be based on the capacity to social distance.
“December is an important month for the trade. We do realise that December 2020 is going to be different from any other December but people are going to socialise,” he said.
“The real question that government has got to ask itself is, do they want to be in a controlled environment with social distancing with masks or do they want it to be in the domestic setting that we know has led to most of the spread of the virus that has been there in the last number of weeks and months.”
Cribben said that due to demand it would be safer for all pubs to reopen as it would mean fewer unregulated large gatherings. 
“The broader that demand is spread, the better it will be for allowing for less congregation for people.
“I think it’s actually in the public health interest to have as broad a range of outlets open as possible.”

POLICE IN NORTHERN Ireland have released CCTV footage of the suspected gunmen involved in the shooting of a 61-year-old woman in her home. 
Shortly before midnight on 5 October, ten shots were fired at the front of a property on the Bushmills Road in Coleraine striking the woman inside in the house. 
The PSNI said the grandmother had been sleeping in a chair downstairs due to her various health problems when she was shot in the head by one of the many bullets fired at the house by a gang of three men.
The woman was taken to hospital where she is now making good progress, however, police are treating the incident as attempted murder.
“I have stated previously that I believe the attack was carried out by members of the North Antrim UDA and that two different types of weapons were used,” Detective Chief Inspector John Caldwell said. 
“I know one of the guns has been used multiple times to hurt other members of this community over recent months and it needs to be removed from the clutches of these dangerous individuals.”

The CCTV footage shows two of the suspects walking in a lane behind the house following the shooting. They are both wearing hats and police believe the man on the left-hand side of the screen is carrying the shotgun used in the attack.
The third suspect is thought to be seen in the second piece of footage showing a man running along the lane carrying a handgun. 
“It is my assessment that this handgun has been used been used multiple times to hurt other members of this community over recent months and it needs to be removed to prevent further attacks,” Caldwell said. 
Caldwell appealed to the Coleraine community to “help us remove these violent criminals and this weapon from their streets by bringing any information they have to either the police or Crimestoppers which is completely anonymous”.

The one concern I’d have is that maybe there is a complacency among some SMEs out there, that everything will be okay and ‘sure if we get a deal, won’t that be okay?’ It will be different, and you’ve got to get that into your heads. Businesses have to get it into their heads that life will be different, unfortunately, after the first of January.
Despite the warning, Martin sounded an optimistic note about the prospect of a post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and the EU.
The Taoiseach said there have been “intensive” engagement for weeks and there is now “texts on all areas”. He added that it remained to be seen whether the text on the outstanding areas could be agreed.
Over 90% of topics have been agreed upon and drafted but three main obstacles have remained as a block to securing a final deal before the deadline: the level playing field, governance, and fisheries.  
Martin said this morning that a deal is “in the best interest of the United Kingdom, of Ireland and of the European Union”.
“President von der Leyen did say to EU leaders last Thursday night at our virtual conference meeting that there were texts now on all areas. So I would be hopeful that by the end of this week we could see the outlines of a deal,” he said.
But that remains to be seen. It’s a down to political will in the United Kingdom and I’m clear the political will is there in the European Union. So one must remain hopeful that a deal can be arrived at.
On a disputes mechanism that could be in place following a deal, Martin also said he was confident, noting that there is “a lot more in common between the United Kingdom and Europe than that which divides us.”.

Martin was visiting Dublin Port to inspect the Brexit-related infrastructure in place and said that he observed “tremendous interagency cooperation” at the port. 
Trade arrangements for Northern Ireland, being researched and discussed by a separate committee, remain unclear ahead of 31 December when the UK will leave the Brexit transitionary period. 
Addressing concerns that Northern Ireland consumers will be left with less choice on shelves and more expensive goods, the Taoiseach said: 
“There are issues that people have genuinely raised on the UK side and within Northern Ireland. The First Minister and Deputy First Minister wrote jointly to us in relation to that and however it goes, the discussions on the protocol have gone well and so I would be confident we can resolve those as well.”","The UK’s post-Brexit transitionary period ends on 31 December.",4,0,0,23422,"Mon 2:12 PM"

ONCE UPON A time I used to limit my caffeine consumption in the evenings.
Breaking the no-coffee-after-6pm rule could keep me awake at night, so it was a risk not worth taking.
Nowadays that rule is obsolete. Since kids arrived and seized control of my life, there are nights when I wouldn’t back myself to make it up the stairs to bed without the aid of a double espresso.
Coffee was at the forefront of my plans for the Saturday morning of the weekend before last, which began with the rugby international between New Zealand and Argentina.
The presence in my home of a boy who has yet to develop an appreciation for staying in bed beyond 6am ensured that I’d be up just in time for kick-off. Every cloud etc…
When his older sister emerged as half-time approached and expressed her disapproval of my choice of programming, it set the tone for what was to become of my naive hopes of spending a decent portion of the weekend in front of the television.
“Look,” I pleaded with my four-year-old commander-in-chief while flicking through the channels, “Paw Patrol isn’t on at the moment.”
“So just put on Netflix and we’ll watch it there,” she countered.
And so it came to pass that while the Pumas were recording their historic win over the All Blacks, our TV was devoted to a team of canine superheroes.
Later in the day, while Jake Morris made shit of Cork’s All-Ireland prospects with a late goal for Tipperary, I was preoccupied with a type of excrement that brings in €7 billion a year for Pampers.

Raising children requires the making of sacrifices – it’s what you sign up for – but can a man not be left alone to suffer through his county’s painful yet inevitable exit from the hurling championship in peace?
Having been deprived of live sport for much of this year, we’re now being compensated with copious amounts of the stuff. As a parent, enjoying any of it has been far more challenging than I could have anticipated, which raises the question:
Is there such a thing as too much sport?

It’s a possibility I found myself considering once again over the past 48 hours as another hectic weekend of fixtures was served up across various codes.
The one-year-old’s afternoon nap on Saturday coincided with the first All-Ireland hurling quarter-final. As I pounded the pavements with the buggy, a glance at Twitter revealed that I was missing out on a championship match for the ages being delivered by Tipp and Galway.
Right on cue, as if directorial control of my life had been taken over by Wes Anderson, the mucky remnants of some spot-flooding were foisted upon my pants by a passing car.
A WhatsApp group populated by friends with children of their own was soon abuzz with in-play analysis, leaving me wondering why I seem to be the only eejit getting the balancing act wrong.
My last-ditch attempt at reasoning with an infant – “please go to sleep so I can go home, Joe Canning has just made it a draw game” – unfortunately fell on deaf ears.
That evening, I thought I had identified an opportunity to get a look at the Tottenham-Manchester City game when my wife, upon recognising my growing levels of despair, temporarily released me from the shackles of fatherhood.

My plans were scuppered, however, when I discovered that the TV was being commandeered for the first Christmas movie of the season. The Grinch, not content with stealing Christmas, was now coming for the Premier League title race too, the selfish git.
The last two weekends have revealed that a sporting schedule as stacked as the one we’re currently in the midst of doesn’t go hand-in-hand with effective and responsible parenting.
Indeed, no one wants to look back in years to come and realise that they missed something significant in their child’s upbringing for the sake of the 12.30pm kick-off between Bournemouth and Reading.
But without this deluge of live action, getting through these bleak winter weeks and months, of which there are many still to come, would be a much grimmer proposition.
Too much sport? Try telling that to the football people of Tipperary and Cavan this morning.

318,197,"New online mental health service launched for frontline workers",https://www.thejournal.ie/new-mental-health-service-5276290-Nov2020/,"A NEW MENTAL health service has been launched for frontline workers.  
Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly announced the service, which is being provided by turn2me, and said it’s for anyone who is working on the frontline, from healthcare professionals to those working in retail, and from teachers to tradespeople.
The new tool for frontline workers is an instant chat service. Each session is facilitated by a mental health professional and supported by trained volunteers.
There are 20 groups available each week and there are job-specific groups available, as well as groups based on shared issues such as stress, burnout and how to maintain a healthy work-life balance. 
Groups are scheduled at different times in the day throughout the week to accommodate shift workers, and participants can remain anonymous when online. 
Donnelly said: “It has been a difficult year for everyone across the country, but especially for our frontline workers. While the majority of people were asked to stay at home, our frontline workers went to work.
“Among them were our healthcare professionals who acted selflessly, putting their own health at risk, in order to care for their patients. We owe them, and all frontline workers, a debt of gratitude. These experiences will have taken a toll on many, which is why this online professional mental health service from turn2me is so important.”
Demand for turn2me’s services has increased significantly. At the peak of the pandemic earlier this year, demand spiked by 386%.

Brian Holohan, clinical manager at turn2me, added: “The adverse psychological impact of working in such stressful circumstances, while at the same time dealing with the reality of Covid-19 in their personal lives, should not be underestimated.
“There’s a large evidence base that peer support, like the service we’re launching for frontline workers, is effective and that it can also act as a helpful gateway for people who haven’t reached out for help before. If you’ve been struggling in any way, please know that you are not alone and that talking will help.”","The new tool for frontline workers is an instant chat service.",60,0,4,10466,"Mon 2:56 PM"

“The last few weeks have not seen devolution at its best. That is something of an understatement,” he said.
The Stormont Executive also today agreed a support package ahead of two weeks of strict restrictions from Friday to suppress the spread of coronavirus.
Finance Minister Conor Murphy said the funding comes from £400 million which Stormont received from the Treasury two weeks ago.

“They’re working very energetically on this. He [McCraith] hopes to have a strategy for government by the 11th of December, in terms of how we will distribute vaccines.
“It will require a national effort to get the vaccines out properly and safely. And we are working with all stakeholders and people generally to cooperate with us.
“And again, a bit like the inter-agency cooperation on Brexit, we will need inter-agency cooperation. All hands on deck for a national effort around the vaccine as well,” said the Taosieach.

He was part of the county squad until 2011 before emigrating to Australia for three years and then returning in 2014. 
In 2016 he featured as Westmeath played Dublin in the Leinster senior football final and his brother Ray played for the county against the Sam Maguire kingpins earlier this month at the quarter-final stage.
He has plenty experience of inter-county football but has huge concerns about the future of the game in Leinster, which was again brought into sharp focus after Dublin cruised to a 21-point win in Saturday night’s final in Croke Park.
Connellan articulated those issue in a thought-provoking open letter that he tweeted yesterday and it’s reproduced here with his permission.
“A chairde,
“I am writing this open letter out of an abundance of concern for the game of football following the most recent mauling at the hands of Dublin of a proud county in the Leinster Championship.
“I will start this letter by saying that I am a huge admirer of Dublin. The work that has been done in the Capital over the last 20 years, on and off the field, has been immense and the Dubs are reaping the rewards of that human and financial investment.
“Dublin GAA is operating at an absolute optimal level on and off the field within the framework that the GAA has provided it, and that is all that any player/supporter can ask of their county board, team management and players. They deserve nothing other than enormous credit for that.

“Under the tenure of ex-President of the GAA, Sean Kelly (2003 – 2006), a committee was established to “rescue” the GAA within the Capital. Football and hurling were under threat from other sports, socio-economic factors, and a lack of investment in areas where the GAA was struggling to gain a foothold.
“In 2003, Dublin had not won a football All-Ireland since 1995 and had only won three of the previous ten Leinster titles. Following the formation of this committee and its ensuing work, Dublin from the years 2007 – 2017 received in the region of €16,612,847 in centrally-administered GAA coaching and games development funding. By contrast, the runners-up in last night’s Leinster Championship, Meath, during the same period received €822,647. My own county, Westmeath, received €725,501.
“Within this timeframe, Dublin GAA also managed to maximise its own commercial and marketing potential. In 2013, Dublin GAA announced its partnership with American insurer, AIG, which was understood to be valued at €800,000 per year for five years. In 2018, Dublin announced that this partnership was to be extended for a further five years for a figure in the region of €4million. That would equate to €8million over ten years. In March 2018, The Irish Times reported that Ballygowan and Britvic Ireland had renewed its three-year sponsorship with Dublin GAA, thought to be in the region of €350,000 over the following three years. Among its other “official partners” which Dublin GAA lists on its website are O’Neill’s, Mitsubishi Motors, Intersport Elvery’s, Kinetica, The Gibson Hotel, and Gourmet Food Parlour.
“Of particular interest to the writer is that The Irish Times in February 2016, reported that Dublin GAA had chosen to remain with O’Neill’s as its official gear supplier for the following three years, despite huge interest from other manufacturers to secure the lucrative Dublin GAA supplier contract. The interest to the writer is, that in 2016, as a member of the Westmeath senior football team in advance of the Leinster final, I gladly and willingly together with all my teammates handed over €35 of my own money to pay for O’Neill’s leisure shorts that we could wear them on the bus to the final, rather than tracksuit bottoms given the warm summer we were having. I also note that one of the major challenges facing county boards across the country is kitting out their underage and senior teams year-in and year-out. It appears that while Dublin GAA has the marketing clout to attract significant financial offers from various competitors to supply their gear, other counties pay for the privilege.

“It is also noteworthy to see the commercial success of clubs within Dublin, none more noteworthy than Cuala GAA, who announced its partnership with biotech giants Amegen in 2019. It should also be noted that one of the largest expenses incurred by county boards is travelling expenses for its players and management teams. Dublin GAA does not have to incur this expense to a fraction of what other counties have to.
“None of the foregoing is to mention the obvious and natural advantage that Dublin’s ever-growing population provides. Aside from having a larger pool of players to pick from, this presents further financial advantages. One would think, given the amount of registered players in Dublin, that the ratio of coaching and games development funding allocated per registered played in Dublin would be lower than the other counties. However, that is not the case. Mayo GAA received approximately €22.30 per club registered player between 2010 and 2014 in coaching and games development money. Tyrone received €21 and Kerry €19. Dublin GAA received €270.70 per club-registered player during the same period. The figures for smaller counties within Leinster are not known to the writer.
“What Dublin have achieved with this allocation of GAA resources and its own marketing and commercial firepower is nothing short of phenomenal, and credit must be given. The committee formed under Sean Kelly as President of the GAA has more than achieved its objective of “rescuing” the GAA in the Capital, and sustainability has now been assured for our games in Dublin.

“Be it down to the success of the work of this committee, or any other factor, following last night’s triumph in the Leinster final, Dublin have now won 15 of the last 16 Leinster Championships and are chasing six in-a-row All-Irelands. An interesting statistic is that in Leinster Championship finals Dublin’s average winning margin over the last eight finals is 14.25 points. My own county’s experience of playing Dublin in championship football has yielded a 153-point losing margin over the last 12 games. As a competition, the Leinster Championship is broken and, this writer fears, beyond repair in its current form. It may be the case that, ultimately, drastic changes to the inter-provincial and All-Ireland structures, together with the fair allocation of resources, might not even be enough to bring football back from the brink. However, we must do something.
“The ultimate conclusion that I hope you can infer from the aforementioned is that Dublin GAA is now largely self-sustainable. It is on that basis that I would call on county boards across the country, but more immediately in Leinster, to demand a fair allocation of centrally-administered GAA resources. Leinster football is, to all intents and purposes, dead. It’s not dying. It is a once-great competition that can no longer be considered a viable entity due to Dublin’s dominance. The committee established under Sean Kelly recognised that the GAA in the Capital was under threat and it jumped to immediate and affirmative action. The GAA is failing to recognise, or is wilfully obtuse to the fact, that the GAA is, and has been, under serious threat in all of the other counties in Leinster for quite some time now. All we are asking is for the GAA to take the same action to address the threats faced by all the other counties outside the Capital which are every bit as important as those faced by Dublin GAA back in 2003.
“I call on county boards as representatives of the GAA in your counties to demand immediate action and parity. I call on players, and the GPA as the players’ representative body, to demand change. We are year-in and year-out sending hugely committed and talented footballers out to run in a race in which they are starting 200 metres behind the eventual winner, while on social media they are told to “train harder” and “believe more”. We all owe current and future players, and supporters, a duty of care to address the inequity which has been created, and to bring meaningful proposals to the GAA on how to address these inequities. Players across the country under the current status quo are being robbed of meaningful inter-county careers. As a GAA community, our inaction is failing them.
Jordan Morris dejected after Meath's loss to Dublin.

“I would encourage all of the county boards in Leinster to come together and discuss potential proposals to bring to the GAA. I believe that we must all be united on this front if we are to cause the GAA to take any meaningful action. Failing the GAA’s agreement to make significant changes, I would encourage county boards to stop the practice of sending players, who give so much to the cause of their counties, to compete in a competition where they are set up to fail. The GAA have too much to lose through TV image rights etc not to listen. Instead, invest the monies allocated to prepare your teams for the Leinster Championship in competing to the highest level in your respective leagues. Invest in your Club Championship, which this summer has shown to be the jewel in the GAA’s crown.
“Unfortunately, I’m of the view, given the perilous state of the Leinster Championship and Leinster Council, and the GAA’s failure to act heretofore, that drastic action such as that suggested might be the only way we can achieve equality in how our games are being run and administered.”

O’Brien said this was the correct decision given the number of applications and permissions to date are “comparatively high in the international context”.
The decision to amend the 2018 Planning Guidelines to seek to restrict all future commercial co-living development in Ireland was made on the back of a report on co-living from officials in his department.
The report raised concerns that the number of developments were become less niche and were now playing a greater role in the country’s housing system, and that many potential sites are outside the city centre. 
A total of 14 planning applications for shared accommodation schemes, all located in Dublin, comprising more than 2,100 proposed bedspaces have been made to date.
Source: Department of Housing
“I believe the number of applications and permissions to date are comparatively high in the international context. Given the unprecedented nature of these developments, I have concerns that the scale of the developments is moving away from the niche quantity of units the concept originally aimed for to a significantly larger role in the housing system,” O’Brien said. 
“I also believe the location of a substantial number of the potential co-living sites is not in keeping with the high density urban centres originally envisaged and that inappropriate locations away from the core city centre have undermined the concept.”
O’Brien added that there is a serious risk that co-living permissions will add to upward pressure on land prices.
The ban will only apply to future developments as any “amendments to the planning guidelines could not be applied retrospectively”. 
“Given the new nature of co-living developments it is appropriate that we draw lessons from the existing permissions once they are built out in keeping with the review originally attached the idea in 2018.” 
The department said an updated guidance document is currently being finalised. 
Former housing minister, Fine Gael TD Eoghan Murphy told TheJournal.ie that O’Brien is right to act. He said:
Co-living was only ever intended to play a limited and niche role in the housing market. It was never intended as an alternative to conventional apartment or housing developments.
Minister O’Brien is of the view there are enough developments in the system to meet anticipated demand and so he is right to act.
‘Dickensian’
Provisions that would allow for co-living were brought in by then Housing Minister Eoghan Murphy in 2018 when he published a document on Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for New Apartments Guidelines for Planning Authorities.
Within this document were guidelines on co-living – or shared living – and how it could emerge as a “distinct segment within the overall urban accommodation sector”. 
Such developments should have a minimum 12 metres squared space for single rooms and a 18 metres squared space for double rooms, according to the Housing Department’s guidance. 
Since this guidance was published, a number of planning applications have been made to try secure permission for co-living developments in Dublin.  The first major proposed development to come to light was located in Dun Laoghaire in May 2019.
At the time, local Fianna Fáil councillor – and now TD – Cormac Devlin told TheJournal.ie that he “wouldn’t even call them bedsits they’re so small”. Green Party MEP Ciaran Cuffe called them “Dickensian in nature”. 
Murphy faced criticism for his defence of such developments in the past, after telling a conference that such blocks offer an “exciting” choice to young workers.
At the time Fianna Fáil’s spokespersons on housing Darragh O’Brien, now the Housing Minister, said he was opposed to the concept of co-living and called on Murphy to amend legislation around co-living
Since taking up office as Minister, O’Brien promised to carry out a review of all housing models, including co-living.
Labour Senator Rebecca Moynihan welcomed O’Brien’s decision but said he should have moved on it as soon as he was appointed.

“Minister O’Brien’s opposition to co-living well documented and he knows well that it is not a solution to the housing crisis,” said Moynihan.
She urged O’Brien to urgently issue new guidelines on the location and balance of purpose-built student accommodation to stop developers converting student accommodation into tourist accommodation.
“There are numerous luxury student accommodation builds across Dublin and we cannot allow developers to convert them into tourist apartments at a whim.
“The number of applications to convert PBSA to tourist accommodation indicates an oversupply of luxury student accommodation. He needs to ban developers applying to convert PBSA into tourist accommodation which is effectively co-living by the backdoor.”
Sinn Féin spokesperson on Housing Eoin Ó Broin has today called on the minister to clarify whether he intends to ban or co-living or just restrict it.
“I welcome in the publication of the Minister for Housing’s review into co-living. However, I am concerned that the government is only restricting co-living developments rather that issuing an outright ban,” he said.
Ó Broin said there are already co-living planning applications in for more than 2,000 co-living bed spaces in Dublin.
“If the proposal is simply to restrict this accommodation, undoubtedly some developers will find a way around this. We have witnessed this approach around purpose-built student accommodation and owners seeking to change this accommodation to co-living.
“We needed to see an outright ban so that there is no wriggle room in terms of any new co-living spaces being developed,” he said.","O’Brien said the number of applications and permissions in Ireland are “comparatively high in the international context”.",20,0,2,34044,"Mon 11:15 AM"

A DONEGAL SWIMMER, who is aiming to become the first person to swim around the coast of Ireland, says he has been inundated messages of goodwill from the public who are following his progress online.
Henry O’Donnell, 56, has been getting requests from people across the country asking him to swim a kilometre in remembrance of a loved one who has lost their life.
The father of six, who is raising money for two charities – The Irish Cancer Society and Water Safety Ireland, is a third of the way through his epic challenge having completed 500 kilometres through choppy waters with the aid of fins and a wet suit.
So far he has raised €10,000, but his target is to raise €100,000. 
“We get requests in from people who have lost a loved one from drowning and they say: ‘will you swim a mile or two for my daughter or son who drowned’,” he said.
“We’ve also had requests from parents whose children are sick. That gives me a little bit of push and inspiration that I’m doing a mile for a particular person on a particular day.
“It inspires me to keep going and to raise as much as I can for the charities.”
He believes people are getting “a lot of positivity” from the event in the midst of the lockdown because they see that the team helping him is doing it for a good cause.
He said: “You look at the website and you see these amazing stories coming in and people are responding to it,” he said. “They realise that there’s a huge effort going into it.”

The security consultant started his marathon swim at Carrickfin beach in Co Donegal in September after four years of training. He has been swimming between five and 15 kilometres a day, depending on conditions.
He has conquered some challenging stretches of water including Tory Island, Malin Head and the sound of Rathlin where the Atlantic Ocean meets the Irish Sea.
His aim is to complete the swim within a year.
“I’ve been swimming in the sea since I was four years of age so it’s natural enough for me to do this but to do it out at sea about 12 to 20 miles off the coast is a little different,” he said.
“Nothing can take away the effect of cold water on the body and mind. It’s all about preparation in advance of an expedition like this.”
“But no matter how much prep you do nothing really prepares you for days when you end up in a really strong swell and you have to get out of the water for safety reasons,” he added.

O’Donnell is no stranger to challenges, having previously become the first Irishman to swim the 14km around Tory Island, and later completed the 38km Donegal Coastal Challenge Swim in 1997 after recovering from a sporting accident in the 1990s which left him paralysed for a period of time.

“I, unfortunately, had a smash off a racing bike in the cycle phase of a triathlon event. I can’t remember it – I was told when I woke up in hospital. I was in a critical state. I was in a coma for quite a long time and paralysed from the neck down,” he said.
“The medical team went to work over a period of time. They saved my life. I had broken C1, which is critical, I broke C2, C3 and I had a fractured skull and multiple bone breaks. I could only move my eyes initially, so they communicated by asking me to move my eyes.”
After a number of operations, he got the sensation back in his body.

He said: “I remember saying to the surgeon get my feet back on the ground and I’ll do the rest. He said: ‘I know you can do it. It’s going to be tough but I know you can do it. Within a year I was back competing.”
He said he didn’t feel sorry for himself, he “got on with it”.
“I know some people haven’t been so lucky,” he said. “I’ve been so fortunate. I don’t dwell on it. It was something that happened in my life. That’s why I like giving back.”

A COVID-19 VACCINE developed in the UK can prevent 70.4% of people from getting the virus, according to new data.
AstraZeneca and Oxford University announced their jab is effective in preventing many people getting ill and it has been shown to work in different age groups, including the elderly.
One of the dosing patterns used by the scientists suggested 90% effectiveness if one half dose is given followed by a further full dose.
Another dosing pattern showed 62% efficacy when one full dose is given followed by another full dose.
The combined analysis from both dosing regimes resulted in an average efficacy of 70.4%.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC Breakfast that the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) would now assess if the 90% effectiveness dosing regime could be used.
He said: “I’m really very pleased, I really welcome these figures – this data that shows that the vaccine in the right dosage can be up to 90% effective.
“Of course, it’s vital that the independent regulator, the MHRA, will need to look at the data, will need to check to make sure that it’s effective and safe of course.
“But we’ve got 100 million doses on order and should all that go well, the bulk of the rollout will be in the new year.”
Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted: “Incredibly exciting news the Oxford vaccine has proved so effective in trials.

There are still further safety checks ahead, but these are fantastic results.
Professor Andrew Pollard, chief investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial at Oxford, said: “These findings show that we have an effective vaccine that will save many lives.
“Excitingly, we’ve found that one of our dosing regimens may be around 90% effective and, if this dosing regime is used, more people could be vaccinated with planned vaccine supply.”
Speaking on BBC Radio 4 Today’s programme about the 90% finding, he added: “There is just a hint in the data at the moment that those who got that regime with higher protection, there is a suggestion that it was also able to reduce asymptomatic infection.
“If that is right, we might be able to halt the virus in its tracks and stop transmitting between people.”
Pascal Soriot, chief executive officer at AstraZeneca, said the news is an “important milestone” in the fight against the pandemic.
He added: “This vaccine’s efficacy and safety confirm that it will be highly effective against Covid-19 and will have an immediate impact on this public health emergency.
“Furthermore, the vaccine’s simple supply chain and our no-profit pledge and commitment to broad, equitable and timely access means it will be affordable and globally available, supplying hundreds of millions of doses on approval.”
Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at the University of Oxford, said the announcement took everyone a step close to a time when vaccines can be used to bring an “end to the devastation” caused by Covid-19.
“We will continue to work to provide the detailed information to regulators,” she said.
“It has been a privilege to be part of this multinational effort which will reap benefits for the whole world.”

Dosage
The results from the Oxford and AstraZeneca trial showed that the arm where one half dose was given followed by a full dose at least one month apart involved 2,741 people. This was the 90% finding.
The other dosing regime involving 8,895 people showed 62% efficacy when given as two full doses at least one month apart.
Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health at the University of Oxford, tweeted: “Oxford jab is far cheaper, and is easier to store and get to every corner of the world than the other two.”
He said the vaccine could be stored in a fridge rather than the minus 70C to minus 80C needed for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
He added: “This is very welcome news, we can clearly see the end of tunnel now.
“There were no Covid hospitalisations or deaths in people who got the Oxford vaccine.
“Although no serious reactions were reported in people who got the Oxford vaccine, we do need to await the full safety data and to monitor safety of all vaccines carefully if and when they are rolled out.
“The reported efficacy of 70% is an interim measure and, as more data accrue, we will get a better idea of the protection it affords.
“Importantly, from what we have heard the vaccine seems to prevent infection not just disease.
“This is important as the vaccine could reduce the spread of the virus as well as protect the vulnerable from severe disease.”

Professor Azra Ghani, chair in infectious disease epidemiology at Imperial College London, said: “Once again we are waking up on a Monday morning to further good news about a Covid-19 vaccine.
“The results from this trial of the Oxford/AZ vaccine are highly encouraging, demonstrating significant efficacy.
A particular strength of this vaccine is that it can be stored in a fridge; this means that it can be distributed around the world using existing delivery mechanisms.
This could therefore have a truly significant impact across the globe and enable an end to the Covid-19 pandemic.
“Of course much will be made of the difference in overall efficacy between this vaccine (70%) and the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines (95%).
“However, it is encouraging to see that, in a sub-analysis, a fractional dosing schedule in which the first dose was administered at a lower level than the second resulted in higher efficacy and gave results comparable to the other vaccines (90%).”
Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: “We have further exciting news that vaccine development is proving successful.
“It’s not yet fully clear why a half dose and then a full dose was potentially more protective, but if the final results continue to show this pattern of around 90% effectiveness, this would allow greater vaccine supply not just in the UK but also globally.”","The vaccine has been developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University.",42,0,0,38550,"Mon 7:21 AM"

THINK ABOUT IT, only for a man eating a bat in a Wuhan fish market in late 2019, Cavan and Tipperary probably wouldn’t be waking up this morning as provincial champions.

A magical day of GAA started with Tipperary landing their first Munster football crown in 85 years and concluded with Cavan ending a 23-year drought in Ulster against the might of Donegal.
The Tipperary win was an upset but not unexpected. Cavan’s four point winning margin over Donegal was very much in the latter category. 
Tipperary had recent experience of beating Cork. They dumped them out in the 2016 Munster semi-final and have regularly met the Rebels over recent years in the league. Cork only beat them by a point in the spring encounter.
Even Meath, who were subjected to a 22-point beat down by a machine-like Dublin the night before, were more talked up than Cavan coming into this weekend. 
Cavan are backboned by the four in-a-row Ulster U21 winning teams. The excitement around Meath was down to the seven goals they put past Division 4 side Wicklow and the 35 minutes when they scored five goals against a weak Kildare defence.
As if 2020 couldn’t get any weirder, Tipperary and Cavan are two of the last four teams left in the race for the Sam Maguire.
But back to how the pandemic benefited David Power and Mickey Graham.

Cast your mind back to early January, before the madness of Covid-19 had properly entered our lives. The big talking point in those innocent times was about the high number of GAA players opting out of inter-county set-ups.
By 8 January, it was estimated that at least 63 players were known to have dropped off county panels for 2020. In truth, the figure was probably higher than that. 
Among the two worst affected by the drop-outs were Tipperary (7) and Cavan (6).
Michael Quinlivan and Liam Casey were among the Premier players who decided to jet off and see a bit of the world. Killian Clarke, Dara McVeety and Conor Moynagh were the high-profile Cavan departures.
Meanwhile had the Munster final taken place as expected in the summer, Colin O’Riordan would have been still in the grind of an AFL season with Sydney Swans. Instead, O’Riordan was back home for the AFL off-season. He was involved with the Premier panel since they reconvened for the final two rounds of the league. 
He travelled to challenge games and trained with the squad, but, concerned by the risk of injury, O’Riordan’s club were reluctant to allow him tog out for a game.
You wouldn’t blame them for wrapping him in cotton wool either. Back in 2016 he broke a bone in his back and punctured a lung during a game for the club’s reserves. His 2020 season with the seniors was disrupted by a hip injury.
Watching Mark Keane strike a late winning goal for Cork against Kerry was the straw that broke the camel’s back for O’Riordan. His requests to Sydney had repeatedly been rejected so he changed tack. 
He contacted Sydney Swans leadership group of Josh Kennedy, Luke Parker and Dane Rampe, explaining the significance of the game and asking them to make a case to head coach John Longmire.

It did him no harm that Keane’s stunning winner had reverberated on social media all the way Down Under and into the AFL bubble.
After giving a powerful display in his first game for his native county since 2015, an emotional O’Riordan thanked the Swans for releasing him for the remainder of the 2020 season. 
“I just want to say I’m extremely thankful to Sydney for allowing me to play this game,” he told The Sunday Game. 
“They were exactly 100% in their rights to say no to me and to refuse me permission to play. But they had no problem. It was John Longmire and all these lads over there at the Sydney Swans.
“They’re an incredible organisation and without them giving me the permission I wouldn’t have been able to play so on a side note I just want to give them a massive thanks.”
The travel plans of Quinlivan and Casey were scuppered and they found themselves back at home with little else to be at when the delayed championship rolled around. By that time they’d already rediscovered their grá for the game after giving their undivided attention to the club campaign.
When the call came from Power, the fitness levels were good and a condensed season of knock-out football didn’t seem so bad.
Clarke left the Cavan squad to get off the inter-county hamster wheel but likewise fancied a return after the club season. 
Could anyone say with any conviction that Tipperary would have beaten Cork without Quinlivan, Casey and O’Riordan? Or Cavan upset Donegal without Clarke restricting Donegal talisman Michael Murphy to a single point?
Cavan’s win was more impressive considering Cian Mackey retired last winter and both Moynagh and McVeety stayed in the southern hemisphere.
The pandemic did them no harm at all. After seven championship wins between them in 23 days, it’s evident that momentum counts for a lot when the games come thick and fast.

The nature of their come-from-behind and extra-time win over the heavily fancied Monaghan turned their season on its head. Just a week earlier, they had suffered relegation from Division 2 after losing to league winners Roscommon.
Cavan played six games in six weeks, beating the Farney, Antrim, Down and Donegal in the championship. They trailed Monaghan by seven and Down by eight at half-time. Four weeks after dropping to the third tier of the league, Cavan were crowned Ulster champions.
In the final game before the shutdown, Longford beat Tipperary by five points. They’ve gone 5-0 since the resumption. Power pointed to narrow league wins over Offaly and Leitrim that sealed their survival in Division 3 as the catalyst for their winning run. 
They made things hard on themselves too. The Premier came from seven behind to force extra-time with Limerick thanks to a wonder free from the sideline by Conor Sweeney. They prevailed in extra-time and a fortnight later Sweeney lifted the Munster title.
Cavan’s winning margins across the four championship games was one, four, one and four. Tipperary’s over four games was three, one and three. Every game went right down to the wire.
For both counties to wind up as provincial champions in the same season is remarkable.

It also ensured that the All-Ireland semi-final line-up is the exact same as it was for the  1920 version, confirmed on the weekend of the 100th year anniversary of Bloody Sunday.
100 years and a day after Michael Hogan and 13 supporters were killed in Croke Park, a Tipperary side wearing commemorative jerseys did their former player and county proud.
You genuinely couldn’t make it up. It’s a promotional tap-in for the GAA’s marketing department. Expect a few more references to the 1920 All-Ireland SFC in the two weeks leading up to the semi-finals.
For what it’s worth, the 1920 All-Ireland final wasn’t played until June 1922 due to the War of Independence. Tipperary sealed their fourth title after beating Dublin by 1-6 to 1-2. After leading by two at half-time, Dublin were held scoreless for the entire second-half game.
It was the first day the teams had met on the field since Bloody Sunday less than two years earlier. 17 days after Tipperary’s victory, the Irish Civil War started.
And it’s another fairytale victory for Mickey Graham, who was a player the last time Cavan lifted the Anglo-Celt Cup.
In 2018 he led Longford half-parish Mullinalaghta to a shock Leinster club title win over Dublin superclub Kilmacud Crokes.
Graham stressed to his players that they were finishing games strong. If they were still in the game with 15 minutes to go they were going to be right in the mix come the final whistle. 
Their come-from-behind wins over Monaghan and Down helped invigorate this group and instill confidence that their time had come. It was thought that Cavan’s golden generation that delivered those four Ulster titles had missed their chance of collecting Ulster silverware at senior level.
But Graham knows a thing or two about upsetting the odds. Cavan’s achievement in winning despite playing with 14 men for 20 minutes against the second favourites for the All-Ireland was exceptional.
Conor Madden arrived on the field three times as a blood sub in the opening half and then shipped a harsh looking black card midway through the second.
It was Cavan’s second black card of the game. A Donegal power play took full advantage of Killian Brady’s first-half black card and outscored them by 0-7 to 0-1 in those 10 minutes.
Conor Smith celebrates after the game.

When Madden was ordered off the field, Cavan knuckled down. They had Graham’s words from the second-half water break assuring them they legs to win the game still ringing in their ears.
By the time he returned, they had turned a one point deficit into a 0-13 to 0-12 lead.
Madden then struck for the game’s decisive moment. He capitalised on Shaun Patton’s failure to gather Gearoid McKiernan’s free that dropped short and smashed the ball into the back of the net.
Cavan’s Padraig Faulkner said after the game he listened to the radio coverage of Tipperary’s victory on his drive over to the Athletic Grounds, and that it added to the collective belief than an upset was possible. 
So Tipperary and Cavan advance into the All-Ireland semi-finals after what might have been the greatest day of shocks in the football championship.
It’s certainly been the strangest All-Ireland football championship since 2010, when the last four consisted of Cork, Down, Kildare and Dublin. 
But watching two Division 3 sides deliver provincial success after such long waits puts 2020 ahead in the pecking order.
Knock-out football, bloody hell.

Pat Quinn was diagnosed with motor neurone disease – known as Lou Gehrig’s disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in the US – in 2013, a month after his 30th birthday.
In 2014, Quinn saw the ice bucket challenge on the social media feed of professional golfer Chris Kennedy, who first dared his wife’s cousin Jeanette Senerchia to take a bucket of ice water, dump it over her head, post a video on social media and ask others to do the same or to make a donation to charity.
Senerchia’s husband had the disease.
Quinn and co-founder Pete Frates, along with their teams of supporters, helped popularise the challenge.
The ALS Association said Quinn “knew it was the key to raising ALS awareness”, calling it “the greatest social media campaign in history”.
Frates, a former Boston College baseball player, died in December 2019 at the age of 34.
When the two men picked up the challenge, the phenomenon exploded, the organisation said. Thousands of people participated in the viral trend, including celebrities, sports stars and politicians — even Donald Trump before his election, and cartoon character Homer Simpson.
Online videos of the challenge were viewed millions of times.

The ALS association said: “Pat fought ALS with positivity and bravery and inspired all around him.
“Those of us who knew him are devastated but grateful for all he did to advance the fight against ALS. Our thoughts are with the Quinn family and all of his friends and supporters. Pat was loved by many of us within the ALS community and around the world.
“It dramatically accelerated the fight against ALS, leading to new research discoveries, expanded care for people living with ALS, and significant investment from the government in ALS research.
Motor neurone disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that leads to paralysis due to the death of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain. There is no known cure.

In the US it was named Lou Gehrig’s disease, after the New York Yankees baseball great who also lived with it.
The organisation added that Quinn continued to raise awareness and funds after popularising the challenge.
In 2015, the association honoured him, among others, as ALS Heroes – an award given to people living with the disease who have had a significant positive impact on the fight against it.
On the fifth anniversary of the challenge, Quinn, who was from Yonkers, New York, addressed a crowd in Boston.
“Nobody knew the ice bucket challenge would become a worldwide phenomenon, but we united as one because that is what it takes to change a disease like ALS,” he said.
“There are warriors all over the world unwilling to accept it as a death sentence.
“We will never stop fighting together. I will not leave this Earth until I know the next person diagnosed with ALS has a real plan to live with this disease, not just die from it.”","Pat Quinn helped raise millions of dollars to help others with motor neurone disease.",74,0,1,78066,"Mon 7:59 AM"

US PRESIDENT-ELECT Joe Biden will name his first cabinet picks on Tuesday, his chief of staff said, even as Donald Trump clung to unsubstantiated claims of fraud despite growing dissent from within his own party.
Biden has pushed ahead with preparations to assume the presidency on 20 January, regardless of Trump’s bid to undo the results of the November vote.
“You are going to see the first of the president-elect’s cabinet picks on Tuesday,” Biden’s chief of staff, Ron Klain, told ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday.
Several US news organisations, including Bloomberg and The New York Times, reported that the president-elect will nominate seasoned diplomat and long-time aide Antony Blinken as secretary of state.
Biden also said last week he had already decided his pick for the key position of Treasury Secretary.
US media also widely reported he will name Linda Thomas-Greenfield, who served as assistant secretary of state for Africa under President Barack Obama, as his UN ambassador.
A growing number of Republicans have either recognised Biden’s victory or at least urged the General Services Administration — the usually low-profile agency that manages the federal bureaucracy — to release federal funds for the Biden transition.
With Trump refusing to acknowledge the election outcome, Biden and his top aides have been denied briefings on sensitive domestic and foreign policy issues — most urgently the coronavirus pandemic battering the country.
Former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who in 2016 advised the Trump transition, said on ABC that the president’s legal team was a “national embarrassment.”
Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, another prominent Republican, told CNN that Trump was making the country look like a “banana republic,” later tweeting the president should “stop golfing and concede.”
Trump has golfed on every weekend day since the election, though he took part virtually in the conference of the G20 leading economies this weekend – skipping a Saturday session on the pandemic.
And even Representative Devin Nunes, an ardent Trump loyalist, conceded backhandedly on Fox News that Biden had “run a successful campaign from a basement.”

Trump again tweeted on Sunday about “massive numbers of fraudulent ballots,” a claim dismissed by a long list of judges in several states.
Appearances by Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani have drawn mockery, as have claims by another former member of his legal team, Sidney Powell.
Powell has alleged baseless conspiracy theories involving a possible hack of the election, earning her widespread derision but also praise from some of Trump’s most ardent supporters.
Giuliani announced Sunday that Powell had been dropped from the team.

Trump’s latest legal setback came Saturday when Pennsylvania judge Matthew Brann threw out the president’s fraud claims in a scathing judgment.
Pennsylvania was a must-win state, and flipped to Biden after backing Trump in 2016.
Brann’s ruling paved the way for Pennsylvania to certify Biden’s victory in the state.

Biden won the state-by-state Electoral College votes that ultimately decide who takes the White House by 306 to 232.
The Electoral College is due to formally vote on 14 December, with state certifications to take place beforehand.
‘Incredibly damaging’ 
State certification of popular vote results in presidential elections is usually routine.
But Trump’s refusal to concede has raised concerns that he could cause long-term damage to public trust in the voting system that underlies US democracy.
The judgment in Pennsylvania came hours after Republicans also requested a delay in certification in Michigan, another battleground state won by Biden.
They requested a two-week delay to allow a full audit of results in Wayne County – home to majority-black Detroit, which overwhelmingly voted for Biden.
Michigan’s board of canvassers, which includes two Democrats and two Republicans, is due to meet today to certify the results.
There were reports that a Republican member of the board was considering voting against certification.
Biden has so far moderated his criticism of Trump’s actions, though he has spoken of “incredibly damaging messages being sent to the rest of the world about how democracy functions.”","Trump’s latest legal setback came when a Pennsylvania court threw out his fraud claims in a scathing judgment.",4,0,0,26788,"Mon 7:26 AM"

334,205,"Opinion: Let's call 'revenge porn' what it really is - sexual abuse",https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/revenge-pornography-5275703-Nov2020/,"LAST WEEK IT was reported that thousands of intimate sexual images, including images of Irish women, had been shared without their consent through the online messaging platform Discord.
Once notified of the fact, Discord identified and removed the source of the images, as well as the more than 500 users with whom the images had been shared. How the images came to be shared on Discord to begin with, however, is the more troubling issue.
Sharing these types of images, a practice commonly referred to as “revenge porn” is now an offence in Scotland, Australia, New Zealand and in England and Wales. In the US, over forty states have passed legislation to punish such activity.
While some of these laws are more successful than others Ireland is now an outlier in having no law which explicitly punishes sharing these types of images without consent.
This is abuse
Language is important here – “revenge porn” suggests that there is a justification for sharing these images. More fundamentally, it suggests that whatever the perceived wrong committed by the victim can and should be righted by the exploitation of their intimate image. Referring to such images or content as pornography, meanwhile, suggests that these images were created for the purpose of public consumption and amusement. 
Professor Mary Anne Franks, a lawyer who has helped to draft many of the laws which criminalise this activity in the United States refers instead to this kind of activity as ‘non-consensual pornography,’ a term which tries to articulate the alarming transformation these images undergo from intimate parts of personal and private relationships to sources of public entertainment and shame.
These images should not be spoken about as revenge porn but instead, they should be viewed as ‘image-based sexual abuse.’ This term captures the non-consensual exploitation involved and the seriousness of the harm which results when they are shared and a person’s sexual privacy is invaded.
While Discord has removed the server and users connected with the images we (and they) know about, the alarming reality is that the images themselves probably live on.
It is highly likely copies of the removed images are still held by those who initially shared them as well as by anyone who downloaded them, or to whom they were then subsequently sent. 
It is important not to think of this share and share again pattern as isolated to a small group (if you can consider 500 people a small group).

On the Friday evening after the reports about the Discord images were made public, the leading searches reported on free pornography sites in Ireland included “discord nudes,” and “Ireland girls nude photos.”
The very real social and psychological distress which image-based sexual abuse causes for victims is compounded by this casual indifference to participating in their public exposure. This is made all the worse because such images are most frequently published not from hacks by a distant third party but as a result of voluntary sharing by current and former partners. 
Where is the Law for the victim?
Irish law offers few remedies to victims of image-based sexual abuse. From reports, it appears that some of the images shared on Discord were of women who are under eighteen or were under eighteen at the time the images were taken.
Where this is the case Sections 5 and 6 of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act, 1998 (as amended by the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017) make it a criminal offence to knowingly possess, produce, distribute, transmit, disseminate, print or publish child pornography or to  supply it, make it available to any person or to encourage or facilitate others in doing the same regardless of whether the person depicted consented to the images being taken, or shared.

Gardaí looking into allegations that large number of images of women were shared online without their consent
However, Irish law provides little assistance to those who were over eighteen when the images were taken. While s.10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 provides for an offence of harassment, it does not provide any remedy for victims who are not persistently followed, watched, pestered, beset or communicated with.
Even where a victim of image based sexual abuse experienced harassment s.10 would permit the prosecution of conduct which was instigated by the sharing – not the sharing itself.  
The result is that individuals who are over eighteen have few avenues of redress. A non-legal route might include seeking to have a sharer who is a member of a regulated profession sanctioned by their professional body.
But this seems inadequate relative to the gravity of the action involved. Availing of alternative routes like this also relies on the capacity of a victim to definitively identify the individual responsible for sharing their image.
When sharing occurs online it is often hard to identify these individuals without an injunction, and a court will only grant such orders where there is evidence a law has been broken. Given the absence of legislation it is hard to see how a court could make an order and without one, a false accusation could leave a victim open to a claim of defamation. 
Claims premised on the GDPR (or the right to privacy) while potentially effective in seeking the removal of images are accompanied by the additional risk of paying an opponent’s costs if an action is unsuccessful, expose the victim to potentially more damaging public attention and cannot provide a victim with the support of the State and its resources which a public prosecution involves.
Equally, a victim can approach a platform where these images are being shared and request they be removed as a breach of the platforms terms of service. Again, however, this places the responsibility and burden of redress on the victim.
While civil actions provide possible alternatives, the crucial question is why victims should be happy with a system which does not recognise this activity as criminal.
What now?
In response to the Discord sharing the Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has announced she intends to work with Brendan Howlin TD to pass the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill 2017 when it comes before the Dáil again next month.

The Bill was previously introduced in 2017 and reached its third stage before lapsing when the Oireachtas was dissolved prior to the general election. This Bill is a welcome development and in its current form would criminalise the distribution of intimate images without the consent of those depicted.
It would also make it an offence to communicate with a person with the intention of causing alarm, distress or harm to them through the publication of threatening, false, indecent or obscene material.
Once in force the legislation could not be applied retrospectively and could only be used by affected individuals from the date on which it entered into force. However, where the images remained online, and continued to be shared, or in circulation the offence would be ongoing and individuals engaged in that process could then be prosecuted.
While we wait for, what must be a speedy adoption of the legislation, it bears repeating that the failure to ensure the 2017 Bill was passed when it was last before the Dáil has enabled a context in which the distress of victims is compounded by the fact the law does not recognise what has happened to them as wrong.
This does not mean the legislation which is passed should be reactive or should not be carefully considered. It does mean that we owe it the victims at the centre of this story to acknowledge that the law has failed to protect them and to ensure it does not continue to fail others in a similar way.

Councillors last week rejected plans for developer Glenveagh to build 850 homes at the 17-hectare site – which is owned by the Council – at the junction of the Port Tunnel and Oscar Traynor Road. 
The proposed redevelopment formed part of Dublin City Council’s Housing Land Initiative, drawn up in 2015, which aims to work alongside developers to build a mix of social, affordable and private housing on large council-owned sites. 
Under the scheme, 50% of the homes would have been private, 30% social and 20% affordable-purchase. 
The plans included 428 homes to be sold privately by Glenveagh, 253 homes which would be bought by Dublin City Council for social housing and 172 homes to be sold to low and middle-income workers. 
Critics of scheme had raised concerns about the affordable units under the redevelopment which were to be provided at €325,000 to €385,000 with the Help-to-Buy Scheme reducing the cost to purchasers.
Councillors had also raised concerns that the Council would be tied to the price it would pay for the social housing units until 2024, a price that wasn’t made public to Councillors due to contract privacy. 
There was also no guarantee the scheme wouldn’t be delayed due to Covid-19. In addition, it would be left up to the developer how they would dispose of the new homes, which some Councillors said could include selling them in bulk to a private investment trust. 
Following Monday’s meeting where Councillors rejected Glenveagh’s plan, Sinn Féin called on Dublin City Council to immediately pursue an alternative redevelopment. 
The party’s Housing spokesperson Eoin O’Broin said the redevelopment should be partly funded by a Sites Service Grant from the Department of Housing and that a three-phased approach should be taken by Dublin City Council to building public homes at Oscar Traynor.
The party issued a circular to all parties and Council management last week calling for the Oscar Traynor site to be financed and redeveloped like the St Michael’s Estate in Inchicore. 
St Michael’s Estate has been designated for Dublin City’s first cost-rental project for low and middle-income workers. 
Sinn Féin has said that Central Government and European Investment Bank funds should be used to develop public housing at the Oscar Traynor site to deliver a mix of social rental and cost rental units. 
However, part of the issue looking ahead is that political parties in the Council don’t agree on a future approach for Oscar Traynor Road. 
Labour Councillor Alison Gilliland told TheJournal.ie that she does not favour a development similar to St Michael’s. 
“We don’t want to duplicate St Michael’s,” said Gilliland. “Every area is of a different housing need, is of a different size and has different constraints.”
The Labour councillor said she is not convinced that cost-rental is the best model to pursue at the Oscar Traynor Road lands. It could impact on those who are renting under a cost-rental scheme but who may lose employment in the future, she said.
Gilliland said Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien and the Council are “going to clash” on the definition of public housing on public land for the site but said “a lot of the work is already done” in terms of design groundwork carried out.

Dublin City Council’s Head of Housing Brendan Kenny said last week that it could take another five to eight years before the site is redeveloped. 
Kenny has argued that the Council does not have the resources available to be a developer on a site like Oscar Traynor Road. 
He told TheJournal.ie that “it is back to drawing board”.
“We’ve a lot of housing schemes going on so now we’ve to figure out how we do this. We’ve no difficulty building a housing estate but this is more than a housing estate, this is a village” said Kenny. 
Kenny said he’d be concerned about the Council borrowing money to fund a cost-rental or affordable housing scheme for the site.
“The key point I’ve been trying to make is that we don’t think we’ll get better value or better quality than what was proposed.”
Councillors have requested an urgent meeting with Housing Minister Darragh O’Brien to discuss the future of the Oscar Traynor development and potential Central Government funding to pursue an alternative project. 
A spokesperson for O’Brien said he has “noted the decision of DCC Councillors” and “will be seeking a report from the Chief Executive”. ","Councillors last week rejected plans for developer Glenveagh to build 850 homes at the 17-hectare site.",3,0,0,26911,"Mon 12:05 AM"

STEPHEN KENNY WILL remain as manager of the Republic of Ireland for next year’s World Cup qualifying campaign after being cleared of any wrongdoing by an internal FAI investigation over a supposed ‘anti-English’ video.
A statement from the association released on Sunday evening confirmed that the Dubliner will face no sanction for his choice of pre-match preparation prior to the friendly with England earlier this month.
“Earlier this week issues regarding content shared with the senior Ireland men’s team ahead of the recent friendly against England at Wembley Stadium were brought to the attention of the FAI,” began the statement.
“Following this development, the FAI decided it was appropriate to look into the matter. Since then the FAI has had discussions with a number of staff members and players, including the team manager, Stephen Kenny.
“The Board has accepted the explanations provided and considers that the matter is now closed.”
It is believed that captain Seamus Coleman and vice-captain Shane Duffy both voiced their support for Kenny over the matter, with other senior players such as Robbie Brady firmly in his corner.
Kenny had a motivational video put together with historical clips of the Great Famine, 1916 Rising and Proclamation of Independence, followed by Ray Houghton’s famous goal against England at Euro 88 and David Kelly’s strike at Lansdowne Road in 1995, prior to that game being abandoned because of English hooligans.
There was a mock-up of ‘1916’ on the Wembley scoreboard at the end, followed by an impassioned speech by the Ireland boss in which it can be confirmed Kenny made it clear that he was not anti-English, but felt it was important for the players to understand the significance of the history and the fixture, as well as what the rivalry means.

Former interim chief executive Gary Owens, who has been retained by the FAI on a temporary advisory basis while the incoming CEO Jonathan Hill works remotely from London due to Covid-19 restrictions, met Kenny for a one-on-one meeting on Friday to hear his side of the matter, and also spoke with assistant manager Keith Andrews, as well as coach Damien Duff.
Senior players were canvassed over the weekend, while goalkeeper coach Alan Kelly is also understood to have been spoken to after he expressed concerns about the video to Kenny prior to it being shown.
Kelly also angrily denied claims he was the leak of the initial story earlier this week when he released a personal statement on social media over the weekend.
While the Ireland boss was described as ‘calm and relaxed’ during his one-on-one meeting with Owens, it’s understood that senior members of his coaching staff made clear their support for the manager in the strongest terms.
The matter is now at an end, with Kenny’s focus able to turn to the World Cup qualifying draw next month.

A DAY OF Gaelic football shocks and landmark victories has ended with the 2020 All-Ireland senior football semi-final line-up quite incredibly replicating that of the 1920 championship.
Last night the GAA staged their emotional and fitting Bloody Sunday commemorations at Croke Park while today it was an afternoon of celebrations on the pitch as Tipperary and Cavan won the Munster and Ulster finals respectively.
Tipperary defeated Cork by 0-17 to 0-13 for a first Munster crown since 1935 while Cavan ended their Ulster wait for glory that had stretched back to 1997 when they defeated Donegal by 1-13 to 0-12.
That sets up semi-final ties with Cavan taking on Dublin and Tipperary will play Mayo on the weekend of 5-6 December.

UK  Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to set out the basis of plans for the festive period tomorrow, as well as detailing a new tougher three-tier system for England when its national lockdown ends on December 2.
But Johnson will be unable to say how many households will be allowed to mix over Christmas and for how many days restrictions will be relaxed for until a later date, the PA news agency understands.
Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove met with leaders of the devolved administrations over the weekend when they “endorsed a shared objective of facilitating some limited additional household bubbling for a small number of days”.
The UK public will be “advised to remain cautious” and told that “wherever possible people should avoid travelling and minimise social contact” under the plans which are expected to be finalised this week, a statement from his department said.
The statement also said that the UK government is in discussions with Dublin over travel arrangements on the island of Ireland over Christmas. 
“In respect of Northern Ireland, Ministers also recognised that people will want to see family and friends across the island of Ireland, and this is the subject of discussions with the Irish Government,” the Cabinet Office statement said. 
New system
Johnson will also detail the strengthened tiered system in a statement to the House of Commons, but the full details of the festive relaxation are not expected until after the first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland agree the plans with their own cabinets.
He is facing the threat of a backbench revolt to his “winter Covid plan” for England after dozens of Conservative MPs warned they could not back further restrictions without extensive evidence.
Downing Street said more areas are expected to enter higher tiers, or levels, next month while those tiers will be strengthened to safeguard the gains made during the four-week lockdown.
The Prime Minister was warned in a letter by the Covid Recovery Group (CRG), said by a source close to the group to be signed by 70 Tory MPs, that he will have to provide a cost-benefit analysis to show the restrictions “will save more lives than they cost”.
But UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak suggested providing the evidence they require will be a tall order, paving the way for a significant challenge to get Parliament’s approval for the restrictions when MPs get a vote in the days before the restrictions are to come into force.
“It’s very hard to be precise in estimating the particular impact of a one-week restriction,” he told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday.

The Prime Minister is understood to be preparing to unveil a plan so that while last orders must be called at 10pm, people will get an extra hour to finish their food and drinks, with opening hours to be extended until 11pm.
Downing Street will hope an easing at Christmas, potential vaccines on the horizon and new scientific evidence will lessen the scale of a rebellion, with the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) expected to publish papers tomorrow saying the previous tiers were not strong enough.
The plans emerged as the Government said a further 739 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Coivd-19 as of the weekend, bringing the UK total to 55,024.
Johnson was to meet with his Cabinet to get their approval for the plans today, while ministers will set out on Thursday what tier each area will be placed in to when the lockdown ends.
Gove, Scotland’s Nicola Sturgeon, Wales’s Mark Drakeford and Northern Ireland’s Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill “reiterated the importance of allowing families and friends to meet in a careful and limited way” in a meeting on yesterday.
They also recognised it “will not be a normal festive period” while “the risks of transmission remain very real”, according to the Cabinet Office statement.","Boris Johnson is to set out the basis of plans for the festive period tomorrow.",7,0,0,44240,"Sun 7:20 PM"

It’s a loneliness on top of a loneliness. You’ve been thrust into a changed world because somebody has died, so every aspect of your world is now new and you’re trying to make sense of that. It could be the person that you usually turned to is the one who has died. They could be the person you ring first thing in the morning and they’re not there anymore. You’re reminded all the time that they are not around, your world is intrinsically changed. You’re left trying to adapt and that’s hard, hard work. And on top of that we’re all adapting to the loss of our normal world because of Covid. So it’s the layer upon layer of stress that people are facing.

Finucane, 39, was shot by loyalist paramilitaries in front of his family in 1989 amid claims of collusion with state security forces.
In February last year, the UK Supreme Court ruled that investigations into the fatal shooting of the solicitor have not been effective and fell short of international human rights standards.
Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has indicated that a decision over how the government will proceed will be announced.
Today it emerged that four of Northern Ireland’s six largest parties wrote a joint letter to Lewis urging a public inquiry.
A letter, signed by senior members of Sinn Fein, the SDLP, Alliance and Green Party, emphasises that establishing the full facts around the killing is a matter of “the utmost public interest”.
“Thirty years on, it remains a matter of the utmost public interest that questions remain unanswered about who ordered the killing, about who knew what, and when,” they wrote.
Only a public inquiry can now assist the Finucane family to get the truth about the scope and extent of state collusion into Pat’s killing. How the British government responds to the Supreme Court is also now a matter of public interest.
“Holding a public inquiry provides the British government with an opportunity to restore wider confidence in the rule of law and the administration of justice.
“We are therefore calling on you, and the British government, to act in the public interest and hold a public inquiry into the 1989 killing of Pat Finucane.”
The letter is signed by Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry and Green Party leader Clare Bailey.
Meanwhile, Finucane’s son John, the current Sinn Fein MP for North Belfast, has written to every member of parliament asking for their support.

In his letter he contends that “only a public inquiry can assist in ascertaining the true extent and scope of British state collusion in the killing of my father”.
“It is a matter of public interest, not just in Ireland, but in Britain and internationally too, that answers are provided to the questions around the full circumstances which led to the deliberate targeting and murder of a human rights solicitor and subsequent cover-up,” he wrote.
“The denial of a public inquiry will have far-reaching implications for confidence in the rule of law and the administration of justice.

Donegal 0-12
Declan Bogue reports from the Athletic Grounds
A DAY THAT began under the most dramatic of circumstances went stratospheric in Armagh City on Sunday evening, when Cavan bridged a 23 year gap to their last Ulster title by beating champions Donegal.
It was the Breffni sides’ sixth game in six weeks and reversed a four point defeat to the same opposition in last year’s final.
A century on from Bloody Sunday, the same four teams have emerged out of their provinces; Dublin, Mayo, Cavan and Tipperary, the last two pretty much unbackable at the start of the day.
Cavan’s start was as determined as it was frantic and over the course of the first half they would have enjoyed more possession than the champions.
They had 14 shot attempts in the first half and jumped into a 0-5 to 0-2 lead after the first ten minutes. James Smith, Oisin Pierson, Gerry Smith, Ciaran Brady and Conor Madden all finding their mark against a Donegal team who appeared off colour.
In response Michael Murphy got his first score from play in the Championship and Peader Mogan chalked up a point.
Cavan went down to 14 men in the 12th minute when Killian Brady was black carded for a challenge on Ryan McHugh coming out of defence. And for the next ten minutes, Donegal simply squeezed the life out of the Cavan kickout and outscored them 0-7 to 0-1 in this period.
Cavan’s challenge was slightly faltering, not helped by a lack of continuity with Conor Smith having to come off twice in the opening half as a blood sub.
Donegal went man for man and put Cavan’s restarts under severe pressure, Paddy McBrearty starting the comeback with two points in as many minutes and Niall O’Donnell adding the equaliser just before the water break.
Another scoring  burst took Donegal in ahead at the break, 0-9 to 0-7.
Cavan hinted they might be onto something with two half-chances at the start of the second half, and a clear gilt-edged chance came on 44 minutes when James Smith had a clear chance skite wide of Shaun Patton’s post.
Donegal spurned their own chances through Peader Mogan and Jamie Brennan, while the point scoring took the sides level.
It looked like they spurned the best chance when Martin Reilly got free of Neil McGee but Patton was equal to his drive on 69 minutes.
The goal when it came was so untidy, but will live forever in Cavan folklore. A heroic Thomas Galligan catch when goalkeeper Raymond Galligan was under severe pressure.
Galligan was injured in making the ‘mark’ so Gearoid McKiernan floated in the high ball. Uncharacteristically, Patton flapped at the ball, it fell kindly to Conor Madden who stuffed it into the net.

Speaking on RTÉ’s The Week in Politics, Minister of State Pippa Hackett said that people needed to “buckle down” for the next few weeks. 
Ireland’s Level 5 restrictions are set to come to an end on Tuesday week, 1 December, and the government is set to decide later this week what will be implemented to replace them.
The government’s decision will be based on advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), with the advisory health body expressing concern about Covid-19 infection rates over the past week. 
Intense talks between NPHET and the government are expected to take place over the coming days.
Hackett said it is difficult for government to provide certainty for businesses, but that they did not want a situation where they could reopen before Christmas and be forced to close again.
“There is no point indicating to people we are going to open up for two weeks at Christmas because that is just a free for all,” the Senator said.
As difficult as it is now to get people to adhere to the regulations, a free-for-all two-week holiday at Christmas, that will be lockdown after Christmas.
“Do we open for a couple of weeks and then shut back down in January? I don’t think that suits any business model and I don’t think that is particularly the message that we should be sending out.”
She added: “We have a week or so now to really buckle down, obey what we have been asked to do. Young and old should be really coming together to do this.”
Hackett acknowledged that there is a “deep frustration” among publicans and restauranteurs about the the ongoing restrictions that they have “put in place measures” but still cannot open.

Speaking on the same programme, Sinn Féin TD Pádraig Mac Lochlainn said that people wanted to have “as normal a Christmas as possible” but that “we have to continue to monitor the public health advice”. 
“We need to get those numbers down as low as possible. So what I would say to government is that they need to be frank with all sectors of business and they need to ensure that the financial supports are there to keep these businesses afloat and to ensure that next year they can continue on,” he said. 
NPHET had previously indicated that it was targeting an average daily Covid-19 of in and around 100 when the six-week lockdown ended but at present the average is closer to 400.

Labour’s Ged Nash TD said that there will be some “flexibility” about restrictions ahead of Christmas. 
“I think there’s probably a certain inevitability that there will be some flexibility built into the system as we approach Christmas,” he said.
“I think the government wants to see a move to something around ‘Level 3.5′ next week to allow certain sectors to reopen. And then there’s a reality that at Christmas week and the week between Christmas and New Year where people will be determined to spend some time with their families. 
The comments from the politicians come as Downing Street said following a meeting between devolved leaders in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales that the UK government is in discussions with Dublin over travel arrangements on the island of Ireland over Christmas. 
“In respect of Northern Ireland, Ministers also recognised that people will want to see family and friends across the island of Ireland, and this is the subject of discussions with the Irish Government,” a Cabinet Office statement said.

Cork 0-14
ON AN EMOTIVE weekend when the GAA commemorations for Bloody Sunday 1920 took place, Tipperary delivered a landmark football moment.
After 85 years of waiting they can now enjoy the mantle of Munster senior football champions, deservedly taking down pre-match favourites Cork in Páirc Uí Chaoimh.
Years of underage accolades and an extended run in 2016 at senior level took them to this game where they made a major breakthrough. After Cork had toppled Kerry, Tipperary entered under the radar but David Power’s team exploded to life in the decider
They got huge joy out of their twin attacking act as Conor Sweeney and Michael Quinlivan excelled throughout. They shot 0-12 between them, Sweeney contributing seven and Quinlivan notching five.
Colin O’Riordan was pitched into the starting side beforehand and the Sydney Swans player made a huge impact at half-forward. He showcased his range of passing, feeding inside forwards and making a few towering catches. Steven O’Brien was highly influential at midfield with the likes of Alan Campbell and Jimmy Feehan anchoring the challenge at the back with solid displays.
Cork were a massive disappointment. They led 0-5 to 0-4 just before the first water break but that was the only time they pushed in front on the scoreboard. Tipperary dragged it back to 0-5 apiece at that juncture, a phase where the teams had looked evenly-matched. But then the winners took over, stitching together four points in a row, between the 27th and 34th minutes.

Cork, four in arrears at the break, were always chasing the game from there. They cut the gap to two at one stage in the second half but their performance was too error-strewn, patchy in their attacking movement, poor in point-taking towards the finish and unable to get much fluency going in their play.

Luke Connolly sparkled early on as he fired over four points but limped off injured at the interval. With Sean Powter having been ruled out during the week with a shoulder problem, those absences hit Cork hard.
But Tipperary were worthy victors and deserving of a spot against Mayo in the All-Ireland semi-final on 6 December. They wavered in the third quarter, a period where both teams were guilty of sub-standard fare. It was 0-12 to 0-9 in Tipperary’s favour entering the final quarter and they saw a goal disallowed for an infringement.
Cork were fortunate there and when Sean White lobbed over a 63rd-minute point, they trailed 0-14 to 0-12. However, Tipperary steadied themselves to outscore their opponents 0-3 to 0-2 in the closing stages. Goalkeeper Evan Comerford fired over a vital free, Quinlivan popped over another after a Cork mistake on their kickout, and fittingly long-serving figure Philip Austin came off the bench to grab their last point.
A day of glory for the Premier, one they will savour.

Murphy says the motion will be moved along with his colleague in the Solidarity-People Before Profit alliance Bríd Smith TD. 
The potential removal of a judge is possible under Article 35.4 of the Constitution for “stated misbehaviour” but this would have to be approved by both the Dáil and Seanad.
Such an impeachment motion can be lodged by any TD for the above reason.
The motion comes after it was revealed a fortnight ago that Chief Justice Frank Clarke had informed Woulfe of his personal view that Woulfe should step down from the highest court in the State.
The move came following the fallout from Woulfe’s attendance at the controversial Oireachtas Golf Society dinner in Clifden in August.
A review into Woulfe’s attendance at the dinner by former chief justice Susan Denham found it would be “unjust and disproportionate” for the judge to resign, and he has subsequently declined to step down. 
Speaking to TheJournal.ie today, Murphy says he is bringing the motion because it is “a question of accountability” and due to both Woulfe’s attendance at the Clifden dinner and his subsequent response.

Golfgate: Woulfe resignation from Supreme Court would be 'unjust and disproportionate' - Denham report
“I think it is the case that Seamus Woulfe’s actions, both in attending the dinner and his response to the criticisms of him attending the dinner undermines the public health effort. And he gave the impression that the rules didn’t apply to him,” Murphy said.  
In a transcript of Woulfe’s answers to Denham as part of her review, he had said the media coverage of the Golfgate scandal was “appalling” and claimed the social event was treated like the “Ku Klux Klan”. 
Last week, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the government would be taking “no further steps” in the ongoing controversy, stating that there is a “deliberately high constitutional standard” required to remove a judge.  It means that government TDs would be unlikely to support such a motion.
Murphy said this afternoon that Martin’s view on the bar to be reached is only an interpretation. 
“When he said last week that there’s a very high bar, that’s not based on anything, it’s not written down anywhere, that’s not a lawyer’s interpretation of what it is. Basically, what is set out in the Constitution is that the Oireachtas may remove a judge for ‘stated misbehaviour. In other words, misbehaviour and which will be set out in our motion,” he said.

Speaking on RTÉ’s The Week in Politics this afternoon, Sinn Féin TD Pádraig MacLochlainn suggested his party would not be minded to support the motion.
“It’s been our view that there are not grounds there for impeachment and indeed Justice Susan Denham had interrogated this matter and didn’t find grounds for him to resign,” he said. 
Labour TD Ged Nash said that his party would discuss the motion but that there is “a sense that this would be a matter for the judiciary”.","The judge would only be removed if both the Dáil and Seanad supported such a motion.",88,0,1,33104,"Sun 1:29 PM"

Police were called to Cable Beach, a popular tourist spot on Australia’s Indian Ocean coast, at about 8.40am.
The man, 55, was pulled from the water with serious injuries and treated by police before paramedics arrived. He died at the scene, police said.
Police said later that they shot at the shark, which lingered close to the shore, for almost half an hour after the attack.
The species of the shark was not immediately confirmed, but locals told reporters it may have been a tiger shark, which are sometimes drawn close to the shore by shoals of small fish.
Kimberley District Office police inspector Gene Pears told reporters that the victim had been body boarding about 30 to 40 metres from the beach when he was attacked.
A couple on the beach saw thrashing in the water and rushed to drag the man to safety. The man suffered injuries to his leg and hand.
“It’s a tragic incident, very unexpected, a person going out to have a bit of fun in the water,” Pears said.
Park rangers immediately closed the beach and a fisheries vessel was assigned to patrol the area.
The victim was the eighth to die in a shark attack in Australia this year, the highest toll since 1929 when nine died.

The introduction of shark nets at popular beaches in the 1930s led to a significant fall in fatal attacks.
The most recent previous attack in Western Australia occurred on October 9, when a surfer was taken by a shark at Esperance on the state’s south coast.
Companions saw the man, Andrew Sharpe, dragged from his board. His body was not found despite a three-day search but his surfboard and parts of his wetsuit were located.
Broome, near where the latest shark attack took place, is about 1,000 miles north of Western Australia’s largest city, Perth.","It is the eighth shark attack death in Australia this year, the worst toll for over 90 years.",7,0,0,48433,"Sun 12:21 PM"

The gathering took place as a farewell to a long-time RTÉ employee on their last day.
O’Callaghan was photographed alongside other high profile RTÉ presenters and staff, such as presenters David McCullagh, Eileen Dunne and Bryan Dobson.
Speaking this morning on RTÉ Radio One’s “Sunday with Miriam”, O’Callaghan apologised and said that it was her own fault.
“I let everyone down and for that I will be forever sorry,” said O’Callaghan.
O’Callaghan said that as someone in the public eye, it is her job to “lead by example”.
This comes as multiple RTÉ personalities apologised for breaking restrictions earlier in the week.
Both presenters McCullagh and Dunne apologised live on the Six One and Nine o Clock News respectively.
“I am unfortunately one of the people who failed to properly observe social distancing here in RTÉ last week,” said McCullagh.
It is an error of judgement I deeply regret, for which I take full responsibility and for which I unreservedly apologise to you our audience.
Dunne apologized for her lack of judgement by attending the gathering, particularly to other employees of RTÉ who have kept the broadcaster Covid-free since the crisis began.

360,202,"A breakthrough at Liverpool and senior caps for Ireland in a career to be proud of",https://www.the42.ie/darren-potter-retirement-interview-5273067-Nov2020/,"THE LENSES WERE already pointing at the Liverpool bench when Darren Potter went to take his place on it at the Arnold Schwarzenegger Stadium.
With the attention of the press photographers directed towards two men in particular, Potter tried to play it cool in the hope that he wouldn’t look like a rabbit in the headlights in the following day’s newspapers. Aged 19, he was the youngest of the 18 players selected to travel for Rafael Benitez’s first game as Liverpool manager.
It was a new beginning for the Spaniard, but for Michael Owen it was the beginning of the end. To preserve his value ahead of a move to Real Madrid that was completed within 72 hours, the England striker remained an unused substitute.
Liverpool’s tie against Grazer AK marked the start of a Champions League campaign that would culminate nine months later with Steven Gerrard lifting the silverware.
When Steve Finnan was called ashore in the 85th minute of the 2-0 victory in Austria, Benitez summoned Potter to make his debut for the European champions-elect.

“There’s a photo of me sitting on the bench with Michael Owen – clearly Liverpool didn’t want to cup-tie him before his transfer,” Potter recalls. “I do remember sitting there and being convinced that I didn’t have any chance of getting on the pitch, so it came as a bit of a shock to be brought on.” 
For Potter, a career in competitive first-team football that commenced on that August 2004 evening came to an end this week. From the highs of playing for Liverpool in the Champions League to the lows of a long-term injury and relegation, the midfielder has found himself in reflective mood over the past few days amid a deluge of well wishes from former team-mates.
He turned 35 last season while playing in League One for Tranmere Rovers, where his spell was cut short when Covid-19 brought the campaign to a premature conclusion.
There was a brief link-up with National League club Altrincham in October, but after nearly 20 years as a professional, he deduced that being involved in a part-time set-up for the sake of prolonging his playing days was a prospect that didn’t appeal. 
“I only registered with Altrincham for one game because they were short players with Covid,” he says. “It was in my mind that I might explore playing part-time but I quickly realised that I’m not up to speed at the moment, having not trained since the lockdown started in March and I hadn’t played since December, so I was short on match fitness.
“My phone wasn’t exactly ringing off the hook with offers from teams either. Obviously I wanted to stay within the league, but with that not being the case I took everything into consideration and thought now was the right time to finish.”
When Rafa Benitez succeeded Gerard Houllier in the summer of 2004, Potter benefited from the ex-Valencia boss’s desire to accelerate the development of Liverpool’s homegrown talent.
A born and bred Liverpudlian, Potter’s displays for the reserve side had already earned him a reputation as one of the club’s most promising youngsters. Benitez had faith from the outset and gave him all 90 minutes of the return leg against Grazer AK at Anfield.
“Starting in that game was a massively proud moment for myself and my family,” Potter says. “Even after coming on as a sub in the away leg, it’s not something I would have expected. It was a little bit daunting but it was something I had been working towards.
“I remember Alex Miller, one of the coaches at Liverpool, pulling me in one day and saying the manager wanted to promote the youth and that he wanted me to be a part of it. Rafa then gave me some opportunities, which was a great experience.
“Gerard Houllier had obviously been there before but, certainly for the young lads coming through, the way Rafa dealt with us and showed us his way of coaching was something new.
“We were used to English coaches who thought us the English way, so to have this European experience and an international style, for want of a better way of putting it, was real eye-opener.”
Potter made his Liverpool debut in 2004.

Potter made 10 appearances for Benitez’s side – including a Premier League debut in a win at Charlton Athletic – during the 2004-05 season. For an untested novice seeking to shine while in the shadow of players like Steven Gerrard, Dietmar Hamann and Xabi Alonso, it was an encouraging start.
“It’s only now that I can start to reflect to any kind of degree,” he says. “It’s phenomenal to look back at the kind of world superstars you were in a dressing room with. At the time I was just going along for the ride without thinking too much about it.
“Stevie Gerrard was obviously the best player at the club and he always gave time and a few words of advice. Dietmar Hamann was a big influence on me as well; he was always guiding me through and giving plenty of help along the way if I needed it. If you had any questions, he’d be there to answer them.”
During Liverpool’s journey towards their Champions League triumph of 2005, Potter played again as a substitute in the first leg of the last-16 win over Bayer Leverkusen.
He was also included on the bench for both legs of a quarter-final tie against a ludicrously talented Juventus team that boasted the likes of Gigi Buffon, Fabio Cannavaro, Lilian Thuram, Gianluca Zambrotta, Pavel Nedved, Alessandro Del Piero, David Trezeguet and Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
When Liverpool produced a remarkable comeback to beat AC Milan in the final, however, Potter didn’t receive a medal after being omitted from the matchday squad.
The tally of 25 medals presented to the winners in those days was increased to 40 by Uefa in 2012, widening the scope for ensuring that those who play a part are rewarded with a memento.
“I had only played a bit-part, it wasn’t like I was in every single squad,” Potter insists. “I had no qualms. It would have been nice to take home a Champions League medal, of course, but there’s no disappointment over it.” 
Potter played seven times for Liverpool the following season, before embarking on a loan move to Southampton. While there, he played in a 2-0 win over Millwall alongside 16-year-old left-back Gareth Bale, who was making his debut in senior football.
There was another loan switch for the 2006-07 campaign, this time to Wolverhampton Wanderers, where the impression he made convinced manager Mick McCarthy to table a £250,000 bid in an attempt to make the transfer permanent.
With Liverpool en route to another Champions League final, and the path to the starting line-up obstructed further by Mohamed Sissoko and Javier Mascherano, Potter recognised that opportunities at Anfield were likely to remain limited. In the circumstances, a three-and-half-year deal with a club of Wolves’ standing was too good to turn down. 
“It was clearly going to be very difficult for me to play at Liverpool. It was also just as important for me to start making my own path at that stage in my career,” says Potter, who had just turned 22 when he cut ties with the Reds.

“The years I spent at Liverpool are something I hold very dear to my heart. Do I still feel a connection to the club? Yeah, nobody can ever take away the fact that I was there. I played a part, albeit a small one, and it gave me some incredible memories. But it was the right choice for me and my family and it’s something I never regretted.”
A key player during his first season at Molineux, Potter played 43 times as Wolves missed out on promotion to the Premier League with a play-off semi-final loss to West Bromwich Albion. 
Thereafter, his role under McCarthy was reduced, causing a deterioration in their working relationship. Ahead of the 2008-09 season, which concluded with Wolves securing their return to the top tier of English football, Potter was told he was free to leave. 
“The first season went really well and the second wasn’t too bad either, but Mick told me he was going to bring other midfielders in and that I’d be down the pecking order, so if I wanted to move on to another club I could. I said I wanted to stay and fight for my place because I really enjoyed it there, but Mick saw things differently.

“I felt as though I was training really well every day. I wasn’t somebody who decided to toss it off just because I wasn’t involved. I never really had that mentality, so I kept coming in and doing what I was supposed to in the hope that it would impress Mick. 
“He didn’t think there was a place for me so things became a bit strained. I knocked on his door a few times to see what I could do to force my way into the team, but it wasn’t to be. To be fair, they got promoted to the Premier League that season, which probably proved that Mick was right in the end.”
By the time Potter eventually left to join Sheffield Wednesday, he was a Republic of Ireland international. His early form at Wolves earned him a debut under Steve Staunton against Ecuador in May 2007. He picked up four more caps, the last of which came in a February 2008 game against Brazil at Croke Park that was settled by a second-half Robinho goal.
Potter qualified to represent Ireland via his paternal grandparents, who hailed from Dublin and Clare. When an U16 call-up came from the FAI, he didn’t need to be asked twice.
“It was always a really big moment for the family when I represented Ireland. They [his grandparents] were absolutely ecstatic so I was very proud to have done it on their behalf. Playing for Ireland was an enormous honour that I never once took for granted. It was such a pleasure to be involved.
“I did get a phone call from someone involved in the English set-up asking if I’d come and train, but I was already embedded in the Ireland youth set-ups at that stage. I felt comfortable there and I was really enjoying it so I didn’t feel any desire to switch.”
Although Potter felt he acquitted himself well during the training camp in Portugal that launched Giovanni Trapattoni’s reign, his international career went no further. 
“I look back on that as a bit of a strange period. I travelled to Portugal for the first get-together and we played a couple of games against local clubs. I actually scored as well but that was it for me, which was obviously disappointing, but that’s life.”

Despite eventually suffering relegation, signing for Sheffield Wednesday allowed Potter to get “back on track” following his frustration at Wolves. In 2011 he was on the move again, beginning a spell at MK Dons that he describes as “the most successful and enjoyable” period of his career.
He was troubled by achilles tendonitis for the majority of his time in Milton Keynes, yet Potter was seldom absent. Over the course of his six seasons with the club, he made a remarkable 263 appearances across all competitions.
Promotion to the Championship was the highlight, but an FA Cup goal against Chelsea and a 4-0 win over Manchester United in the League Cup are also among his fondest recollections.
“That was a great night,” he says of the game against a United side managed by Louis van Gaal in August 2014. “They left a few of their big stars at home but they still brought plenty with them. I think they were expecting an easy night at the office but it gave me one of my best experiences.”
Having been mentored during his own formative years by some of Liverpool’s senior players, Potter was never reluctant to impart his knowledge and experience to younger team-mates, such as the talented 16-year-old who made his debut for MK Dons in 2012. 
“I first saw Dele [Alli] when he came to train with us at 16. From the very start he didn’t look out of place. You would have thought he had already been around for a couple of years. The manager, Karl Robinson, had huge belief in him and he said from day one that he’d play in the Premier League.
“With young players, you try to guide them in whatever way you can, whether you’re just talking to them on the training ground or giving them a rollicking during a game if they’re doing certain things wrong. You’re just looking to help them along in the same way that people helped you in the past.”
Although Potter played his part in aiding Rotherham United’s promotion to the Championship in 2017-18, the achilles problem finally caught up with him. 
“It was definitely the most difficult part of my career. I ended up rupturing it and it was the best part of 16 months before I got back to play a game. It was a really tough time.”
He signed for Tranmere Rovers prior to the 2019-20 season, which he didn’t initially intend to be his last, but the global pandemic’s impact on football ultimately expedited the onset of retirement.
“If you asked me a few years ago what I’d be like on the day I retire, I would have said that I’d probably break down in tears. But with the way the last few seasons have gone for me, the decision was probably easier to come to terms with.
“I was hoping to go on a bit longer but circumstances dictated that wouldn’t be the case. The way this year has been has definitely prepared me for it. It has afforded me plenty more time in and around the house with the kids.”

A lazy assessment might determine that a career spent predominantly in the Football League can’t compare to the grandeur of big Champions League nights at Anfield. However, Potter has been in the game long enough to know that he left nothing behind.
Many others who were momentarily exposed to the limelight at elite clubs of Liverpool’s stature have understandably struggled to persevere when attempting to resume their journeys elsewhere. The attachment can be difficult to relinquish.
A fine line separates players who make a healthy living below Premier League level from those who bear the misfortune of drifting out of the professional game entirely. For a decade and a half, Potter stayed on the right side of it while savouring a myriad of notable accomplishments, the memories of which will sustain him long into retirement.
“I think the important thing for me about leaving Liverpool was that I wasn’t actually released,” he explains. “I made the decision to start carving out my own path, which helped, and going to Wolves under Mick McCarthy was a great opportunity.
“Listen, I’m not saying if I had stayed at Liverpool I would have played another 20 or 30 games, because that wouldn’t have been the case. Eventually I think I would have been released.
“I’ve seen it myself where players are let go by big clubs and they find it hard to see another path forward for them, but sometimes you just have to spin it on its head. All is not lost when you leave these big clubs, you just need to have the belief and the right people behind you.
“I do feel a lot of pride about the whole thing when I take a step back and weigh it all up. I never really took stock while I was playing but I can do that now. I think I can be proud of what I achieved, the clubs I played for and the amount of games I racked up.
“The longevity is something I was always proud of. In one season at MK Dons I played all 90 minutes in 55 games. Little things like that give me real satisfaction when I think about them.”
Potter, a father of four, is already taking his first steps as a coach by contributing to the academy at League Two club Port Vale, where his eldest son (15) is also learning the ropes as a young footballer. There’s a busy schedule of school runs to keep him occupied too.
He’ll be able to regale his kids with a few decent tales from the Liverpool and Ireland days when they’re all old enough to appreciate them. For now, they “couldn’t care less”, he laughs.
“To be fair, I think they find it a bit surreal that it was actually me. As time goes by I’m sure it’s something they’ll take some pride in.” 
If paternal utopia is to avoid being classed as an embarrassing dad, Darren Potter can consider his career to have been an unqualified success.","‘It’s phenomenal to look back at the kind of world superstars you were in a dressing room with.’",4,0,0,59478,"Sun 10:00 AM"

The incident came as about 10,000 people were protesting in front of the National Palace in Guatemala City against corruption and the budget, which protesters say was negotiated and passed by legislators in secret while the Central American country was distracted by the fallout of back-to-back hurricanes and the Covid-19 pandemic.
About 1,000 protesters were demonstrating outside the Congress building.
Videos on social media showed flames shooting out of a window in the legislative building. Police fired tear gas at protesters, and about a dozen people were reported injured.

“We are outraged by poverty, injustice, the way they have stolen the public’s money,” said psychology professor Rosa de Chavarria.
“I feel like the future is being stolen from us. We don’t see any changes, this cannot continue like this,” said Mauricio Ramirez, a 20-year-old university student.
The amount of damage to the building was unclear, but the flames initially appear to have affected legislative offices, rather than the main hall of congress.
Protesters also set some bus stations on fire.
Mr Giammattei condemned the fires on his Twitter account on Saturday, writing: “Anyone who is proven to have participated in the criminal acts will be punished with the full force of the law.”
He wrote that he defended people’s right to protest, “but neither can we allow people to vandalise public or private property”.
The president said he had been meeting with various groups to present changes to the controversial budget.
Discontent had been building over the 2021 budget on social media and clashes erupted during demonstrations on Friday.

Guatemalans were angered because lawmakers approved $65,000 (£48,750) to pay for meals for themselves, but cut funding for coronavirus patients and human rights agencies, among other things.
Protesters were also upset by recent moves by the Supreme Court and attorney general they saw as attempts to undermine the fight against corruption.

Vice president Guillermo Castillo has offered to resign, telling Mr Giammattei that both men should resign their positions “for the good of the country”.
He also suggested vetoing the approved budget, firing government officials and attempting more outreach to various sectors around the country.
Mr Giammattei had not responded publicly to that proposal and Mr Castillo did not share the president’s reaction to his proposal. Mr Castillo said he would not resign alone.
The spending plan was negotiated in secret and approved by the congress before dawn on Wednesday.
It also passed while the country was distracted by the fallout of hurricanes Eta and Iota, which brought torrential rains to much of Central America.
The Roman Catholic Church leadership in Guatemala also called on Mr Giammattei to veto the budget on Friday.
“It was a devious blow to the people because Guatemala was between natural disasters, there are signs of government corruption, clientelism in the humanitarian aid,” said Jordan Rodas, the country’s human rights prosecutor.","About 1,000 protesters were demonstrating outside the Congress building.",1,0,0,14741,"Sun 9:48 AM"

No living director surpasses Fincher’s reputation for exactitude. Any account of his methods invariably mentions how many takes he likes to shoot, which can annoy him, not because this is inaccurate but because it abets a vision of him as a dictatorially fussy artiste. Fincher, who is 58, argues that this caricature misses the point: If you want to build worlds as engrossing as those he seeks to construct, then you need actors to push their performances into zones of fecund uncertainty, to shed all traces of what he calls “presentation.” And then you need them to give you options, all while hitting the exact same marks (which goes for the camera operators too) to ensure there will be no continuity errors when you cut the scene together.

And you reinforce that constituency’s sense that they matter more than other people when you pander like this, and pretty much all the problems we’ve faced over the past four years, to say nothing of the last five hundred, come from this sense of white people being more important than nonwhites, Christians than non-Christians, native-born than immigrant, male than female, straight than queer, cis-gender than trans.

When I was a young boy I travelled a lot. I’d stay in one place a week. Now I miss the travelling. Not like when it comes to the winter – there’s a lot of difference then – but in the summertime I loved it. Travelling the road, the horse and wagon and all that. Like when you get the bundles of wood on your back and you had to walk two or three fields to get it and bring it back. It was a bit hard, the life. Any Traveller who you talk to, the old ones, they will tell you, it wasn’t easy, it was hard.

Baystate Health had been forced to turn to unproven entrepreneurs like this after the corporate distributor it had once depended on ran out of N95s, when national and international supply chains collapsed at the beginning of the pandemic. Their predicament wasn’t unique. Many hospitals, states and even federal agencies were also desperate, transforming the normally staid market for health care commodities into a Darwinian competition of all against all

365,209,"G20 Summit opens to a call for leaders to collectively act against the coronavirus pandemic",https://www.thejournal.ie/g20-summit-opens-5275173-Nov2020/,"THE G20 SUMMIT has opened with appeals by the world’s most powerful leaders to collectively chart a way forward as the coronavirus pandemic overshadows this year’s gathering, transforming it from in-person meetings to virtual speeches and declarations.
In a sign of the times, the traditional “family photo” of leaders in the summit was digitally designed and superimposed on a historical site just outside the Saudi capital, Riyadh, which would have hosted the gathering. The kingdom has presided over the G20 this year.
The pandemic, which has claimed more than 1.37 million lives worldwide, has offered the G20 an opportunity to prove how such bodies can facilitate international cooperation in crises – but has also underlined their shortcomings.
Saudi Arabia’s King Salman said in the summit’s opening remarks: “We have a duty to rise to the challenge together during this summit and give a strong message of hope and reassurance.”

While G20 countries have contributed billions of dollars toward developing a vaccine for the virus, they have also mostly focused on securing their own vaccine supplies.
Countries such as the UK, US, France and Germany – all G20 member states – have directly negotiated deals with pharmaceutical companies to receive billions of doses, meaning that the vast majority of the world’s vaccine supply next year is already reserved.
A day before the summit, UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres said that while 10 billion dollars has been invested in efforts to develop vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics, another 28 billion dollars is needed for mass manufacturing, procurement and delivery of new Covid-19 vaccines around the world.
Guterres called on more G20 nations to join Covax, an international initiative to distribute Covid-19 vaccines to countries worldwide. The United States has declined to join under President Donald Trump.
The pandemic has had a far-reaching economic impact on developing countries and pushed millions into extreme poverty.
It has also plagued the world’s wealthiest nations, with nine G20 countries ranking highest globally for the most cases of Covid-19 recorded.
The United States tops the list, followed by India, Brazil, France, Russia, Spain, the UK, Argentina and Italy, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University.
Three G20 leaders participating in the summit have been infected by the coronavirus this year: Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro and US leader Donald Trump.
The virus shows no signs of abating as major cities in the US and Europe bring back lockdowns and curfews.
The World Health Organisation says more cases of Covid-19 have been reported in the past four weeks than in the first six months of the pandemic.
The International Labour Organisation says an equivalent of 225 million full-time jobs were lost in G20 countries alone in the third quarter of 2020.
G20 member countries represent around 85% of the world’s economic output and three-quarters of international trade.
As part of the summit, seven leaders released video messages on “Pandemic Preparedness and Response”. France’s President Emmanuel Macron warned of the challenges in obtaining “universal access to health technologies against Covid-19”.
German chancellor Angela Merkel called for strengthening the World Health Organisation and stressed the pandemic can only be overcome if an affordable vaccine is available to all nations.
In a video statement released ahead of the summit, Johnson appealed to global leaders to harness the resources of the world’s wealthiest nations to end the Covid-19 pandemic and tackle climate change.

“Our fates are in each other’s hands,” said Johnson, who plans to attend two virtual events at the summit while self-isolating at home in London after coming into contact with someone who tested positive for Covid-19.
Bolsonaro, who spent months downplaying the severity of the virus while deaths mounted rapidly inside Brazil, emphasised in a video message that world leaders “should take care of people’s health and of the economy at the same time”.
Mr Trump, meanwhile, is among other G20 leaders expected to participate in the closed-door virtual sessions that are taking place Saturday and Sunday.
It does not appear that any leaders have dropped out of the summit, despite calls by rights groups, legislators and EU parliamentarians for leaders to boycott the gathering to protest against Saudi Arabia’s human rights record and the war in Yemen.
G20 heads of state last gathered virtually for an emergency meeting in March as the coronavirus was spreading around the world. At the time, they vowed “to do whatever it takes to overcome the pandemic”.
The nations have since agreed to suspend debt payments for the world’s poorest countries until mid-2021 to allow those nations to focus their spending on health care and stimulus programmes.
The UN secretary-general, however, has called on the G20 to extend debt repayments through the end of 2021 and expand the scope to middle-income countries in need.

100 years might have passed since the senseless attacks by British paramilitary forces on Jones’ Road, but the GAA remembered those tragic events and the 14 who lost their lives with a poignant ceremony last night.
It’s a pity that circumstances meant that Croke Park was almost empty for the event, apart from the assembled media, GAA officials and those involved in the ceremony itself. But in a way, it added to the uniqueness of the landmark occasion.
On the quiet street outside the Hogan Stand – named in 1926 after Michael Hogan who was the only player killed on the day – a group of people were gathered before the game at a small memorial. There was a plaque and candle for each of the victims. The people looked on in a respectful silence.
Inside, a different, more haunting silence enveloped the darkened, empty arena.
An empty Croke Park is a strange experience, even more so when it’s night time and the lights are off.
The only light in the ground came in the corner of Hill 16 and the current Cusack Stand, where the commemoration was set-up. It was the same corner where a machine gunner in an armoured car shot bullets into the air, causing chaos during the first-half of the challenge match between the footballers of Tipperary and Dublin a century ago.
A mixed force of RIC and Auxiliaries had arrived in at least 12 armoured lorries and fired indiscriminately at the crowds, causing injury, death and several crushes as people tried desperately to escape. The scars from the day never left the Association or Croke Park.
The grounds were only purchased by the GAA in 1913, yet the events of 21 November 1920 forever immortalised the venue as a historical landmark.
Special match programmes were issued for the Leinster football final, with front covers that mirrored the match tickets from Bloody Sunday. 
The names of the 14 victims –  Jane Boyle, James Burke, Daniel Carroll, Michael Feery, Michael Hogan, Tom Hogan, James Matthews, Patrick O’Dowd, Jerome O’Leary, William Robinson, Tom Ryan, John William Scott, James Teehan and Joseph Traynor – were stitched into one-off Dublin jerseys for the game.

Brendan Gleeson appeared out of the blackness to read aloud the names of the victims. He gave details about their lives and how they died. A flame was lit for each of them attached to a plaque, with 14 lights shining up into the night sky behind them.
The specially commissioned piece of music, More Than a Game, echoed out in stirring fashion as a video tribute celebrated the lives of the people who left their homes to attend a game and never returned. Taoiseach Micheál Martin spoke, while President Michael D Higgins and GAA supremo John Horan placed a wreath below the tricolour.

Two members of the Artane school of music stood holding Irish flags in front of where the wreaths were laid.
As lights of north Dublin flickered silently in the background, it was impossible not to picture the unspeakable scenes that unfolded on the field below 100 years earlier.
The image of Michael Hogan in his Tipperary kit lying dead on the field near the Cusack Stand sideline and supporter Tom Ryan slumped beside him, both shot in the 90 seconds of madness. Or Jane Boyle, holding the hand of her fiancee Daniel Byron, before a bullet ripped through her back and a crush of people separated them in her final moments. 
Or Patrick O’Dowd, the 57-year-old who was helping people over a high wall at the back of Croke Park when he was hit by a bullet and killed instantly. His limp body fell on top of the last person he dropped safely to the other side.
It was a privilege to be in Croke Park for a night of such significance, when they remembered events that will never be erased from the GAA’s memory and people that won’t be forgotten.

The game that followed was a massacre in a sporting sense, with Meath offering little resistance to Dublin’s sweep to a 10th straight Leinster title. 
After the game the Dublin players gathered at the commemoration where captain Stephen Cluxton laid a wreath as a mark of respect.
“Obviously it’s a huge occasion for the GAA,” reflected Sky Blues manager Dessie Farrell.
“In some ways, what happened here 100 years ago today is very much part and parcel of our identity as an organisation.
“We touched on it during the week about the importance of the night and the commemoration. We just felt in our own small way that it was important to recognise the people who perished on that night and (who were) struck down in very sad circumstances.
“And to just take the opportunity to be grateful for all we have and the opportunity that we’ve been provided by all those who have gone before us, our forefathers and people like who were killed here 100 years ago.”
It was a thoughtful gesture by Dublin on a night where the GAA struck the right tone in recalling the darkest day in its history.

367,193,"Drug manufacturer Regeneron gets green light for new antibody treatment in US",https://www.thejournal.ie/regeneron-antibody-treatment-5275159-Nov2020/,"A COVID-19 ANTIBODY therapy used to treat President Donald Trump was approved by the US drug regulator on Saturday for people who aren’t yet hospitalized by the disease but are at high risk.
The green light for drugmaker Regeneron came after REGEN-COV2, a combination of two lab-made antibodies, was shown to reduce Covid-19-related hospitalizations or emergency room visits in patients with underlying conditions.
“Authorizing these monoclonal antibody therapies may help outpatients avoid hospitalization and alleviate the burden on our health care system,” said Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Leonard Schleifer, Regeneron’s president and CEO, added the move was “an important step in the fight against COVID-19, as high-risk patients in the United States will have access to a promising therapy early in the course of their infection.”
Regeneron’s antibody treatment is the second synthetic antibody treatment to receive an emergency use approval (EUA) from the FDA after a similar therapy developed by Eli Lilly was granted the status on November 9.
The human immune system naturally develops infection-fighting proteins called antibodies – but because not everyone mounts an adequate response, companies like Regeneron and Lilly have manufactured lab-made solutions.
They work by binding to a surface protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and stopping it from invading human cells. 
The FDA said the data supporting Regeneron’s EUA came from a clinical trial in 799 non-hospitalized patients with mild to moderate symptoms of Covid-19.
For patients who were at high risk because of a variety of underlying conditions – from obesity to old age to diabetes – hospitalization and emergency room visits occurred in 3% of patients who received the intravenous treatment.
This compared to 9% in placebo-treated patients.
Patients treated with the drug also had lower levels of virus remaining compared to those on the placebo.

80,000 doses
The company said it expects to have doses ready for 80,000 patients ready by the end of November and approximately 300,000 patients in total by the end of January 2021.
These will be available to US patients at no out-of-pocket cost under the terms of a US government program.
But with cases surging across the US and globally, that means access will not be widespread. The US has added more than 360,000 new Covid-19 cases in the past two days alone. 
The recommended dose is 1,200 milligrams of each of the two antibodies, for a total of 2,400 milligrams, in a single infusion.
Regeneron has received more than $450 million from the US government for its Covid-19 drug development efforts under Operation Warp Speed. 
Covid-19 vaccines, like those developed by Pfizer and Moderna, work by training the immune system to make its own antibodies so they are prepared when they encounter the virus.","The green light for drugmaker Regeneron came after the antibodies were shown to reduce Covid-19 related hospitalizations.",2,0,0,36484,"Sun 7:44 AM"
368,211,"Larry Donnelly: Joe Biden won, but Democrats don’t get it",https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/larry-donnelly-us-politics-5272911-Nov2020/,"TAKING OUT DONALD Trump is a big deal. It is relatively seldom that a sitting President of the United States is denied a second four-year stint in the White House. George HW Bush was the last incumbent to suffer this sorry end in 1992.
Donald Trump is the most controversial president in living memory. And it was arguably his ugly persona and unbecoming behaviour, together with the administration’s mishandling of Covid-19, rather than any of his policies, that sealed his fate.
That key sliver of the electorate who neither love nor loathe the man had enough of him and yearned for a calmer era and a more measured leader.
Enter Joe Biden. After flirting with a few of his rivals for their party’s nomination, Democrats made the wise choice to opt for a senior statesman who may have lost some speed off his fastball, yet retains the respect of an overwhelming majority of Americans. He faces a difficult and unenviable task.
No clear Democratic victory
Significant as it may be – especially in terms of what it has said to the rest of a mystified world – the decision of the US to install Joe Biden as commander-in-chief is only one element of this election.
The scenes of jubilation in city streets after everyone except President Trump and his unthinking adherents realised that he had lost were a justifiable release of tension and expression of hope. Democrats can find little cause for celebration or optimism in the other election results, however.
Although some have pointed to an impressive raw number of votes or other promising indicators, the bottom line remains. Expecting to take over the US Senate, Democrats have failed, barring huge upsets in two upcoming run-offs in Georgia.
Poised to expand their majority in the US House of Representatives, they lost seats. And the outcome was even bleaker locally.
In a postscript, that bible of the American left, The Nation magazine, put it bluntly: “Nowhere was the news worse than at the state legislative level, where despite unprecedented investment by Democratic organisations and outside groups, and expectations that they’d flip from four to eight legislative bodies – or more, in a ‘blue wave’ election – the party lost ground.”
The Nation quotes strategists who cut to the quick in their assessments. “Bloodbath,” “shit show” and “no way to sugar coat it” are some of the descriptions offered.
Progressive activists are endeavouring to reach a defensible conclusion as to why.
They have floated possible explanations. Democrats were responsible to a fault and didn’t engage, as Republicans did to great effect in Florida and elsewhere, in the ground game due to the pandemic.
Their enemies lied and painted them as socialists, communists and anti-law enforcement. The party’s overarching message attempts at mobilisation and social media tactics were poor.
Latino outreach was weak. Joe Biden didn’t pull Democrats further down the ballot over the top with him because there was scant enthusiasm for the 77-year-old personally.
The depth of the disappointment is directly proportionate to the widespread internal buoyancy ahead of 3 November. Democrats saw a president who they regarded euphemistically as a disgrace and who fired up their wealthy supporters to commit monumental sums of money to beat him and put the US on a radically divergent track.
What they believed to be Trump’s blatant misogyny and racism had engendered the #metoo and #BLM movements and would definitely drive participation and translate into votes for the many women and people of colour who were on the ballot.
As such, they needn’t worry unnecessarily about traditional Democratic constituencies or trying to persuade independents and soft Trump voters. A transformative election was in the making.
As wrong as these mainly leftist Democrats were beforehand, their analysis in the aftermath may be even further off the mark. The factors to which they ascribe defeat played a role.

Larry Donnelly: Here's why the make-up of the Supreme Court is so central to US political debate
But politics is a tough business and perception has always been more important than truth in campaigns. The question that has been studiously avoided is why were Trump and the Republicans so successful in caricaturing them as extremists?
For one thing, notwithstanding the prevalent journalistic narrative of two Democratic camps at odds – liberals like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez versus moderates such as the Clintons and Biden – swing voters don’t discern a sizable ideological gap between them. There may be differences in emphasis, style and tone, but the two ill-constructed factions really aren’t all that far apart on most issues.
Failing to win the centre
Actual centrist Democrats are an endangered and broadly scorned species. That, not one of the aspirants to be the party’s nominee for president – when asked at a debate about the just re-elected Democratic governor of deep red Louisiana, John Bel Edwards – would extend a welcome and offer congratulations to him spoke volumes.
The governor is pro-life and pro-gun. Yet he has also fought tirelessly for equal pay for women and for enhanced access to quality healthcare.

Surely it is better to have a part-time ally than a full-time foe? Why would these putative standard bearers not posit that, while they do not agree with John Bel Edwards on every topic, his triumph proves that Democrats can compete and win in all 50 states when they accommodate deviations from dogma?
Here’s the reason for the silence on that debate stage: The governor is a genuine moderate from Middle America and hence persona non grata in the mindset of the well-heeled donors on the coasts who write the cheques and call the shots.
Whether this proposition is true or not is immaterial. It is what millions of middle of the road voters – disgruntled and former Democrats foremost among them – perceive. In rejecting John Bel Edwards, Joe Biden and Co slighted them, too.
As long as this politically crucial segment of the population feels this way about what ought to be their natural home, the party will underperform, even on its good days. I am convinced that it is nearly that simple.

Of course, much has been made of the Republicans’ drift to the hard right and Trumpism and the fork in the road imminently confronting the GOP. It has to be profoundly disheartening for those whose conservatism is akin to Ronald Reagan’s.
Conversely, there have been political gains from this largely unanticipated and unintentional realignment. Plus, the re-election of two Republicans who are a long distance away from the ascendant right – Maine Senator Susan Collins and Vermont Governor Phil Scott – suggests that their tent may be more open than the opposition’s at this stage.
I’ll leave it to them to solve their own problems. For now, I am perplexed as to why my Democratic Party seems determined to make lots of us feel unwanted. And I am absolutely flabbergasted by the steadfast refusal to recognise the consequent political costs of doing so in the wake of Election 2020.

Republican secretary of state Brad Raffensperger on Friday certified the state’s election results, which had Biden beating Trump by 12,670 votes out of about 5 million cast, or 0.25%.
Republican governor Brian Kemp then certified the state’s slate of 16 presidential electors.
The statement from the president’s legal team said: “Today, the Trump campaign filed a petition for recount in Georgia. We are focused on ensuring that every aspect of Georgia State Law and the US Constitution are followed so that every legal vote is counted.
President Trump and his campaign continue to insist on an honest recount in Georgia, which has to include signature matching and other vital safeguards.
The statement added: “Without signature matching, this recount would be a sham and again allow for illegal votes to be counted. If there is no signature matching, this would be as phony as the initial vote count and recount.
“Let’s stop giving the People false results. There must be a time when we stop counting illegal ballots. Hopefully it is coming soon.”
Georgia law allows a candidate to request a recount if the margin is less than 0.5%. The recount would be done using scanners that read and tabulate the votes.
County election workers have already done a complete hand recount of all the votes cast in the presidential race. But that stemmed from a mandatory audit requirement and is not considered an official recount under the law.
State law requires that one race be audited by hand to ensure that the machines counted the ballots accurately, and Raffensperger selected the presidential race.
Because of the tight margin in that race, a full hand count of ballots was necessary to complete the audit, he said.

370,212,"England are a better team than Ireland and more work is needed to close the gap",https://www.the42.ie/ireland-england-lineout-autumn-nations-5275126-Nov2020/,"AN ENGLAND WIN hardly came as a surprise at Twickenham yesterday and the 11-point margin was almost exactly what had been predicted in most quarters, but the sense of inevitability made it no less disappointing for Ireland.
While Andy Farrell spoke with pride of the character in his team’s performance during his post-match media duties, it’s obvious that Ireland would have shipped a hammering without that very basic requirement.
There is no shame in losing to the World Cup finalists away from home but the frustration will be that Ireland’s own shortcomings played into their hands. 
Nowhere was that clearer than at lineout and maul time as Ireland botched at least four on their own throw at important times and often inside the English 22.
Ronan Kelleher’s throw evading Peter O’Mahony towards the tail of the lineout in the 21st minute was the source for Jonny May’s scintillating second try. It was a wondrous solo score but Ireland should be deeply aggrieved about conceding from deep inside the opposition 22 – a rare occurrence at this level.
Out-half Ross Byrne was unable to gather in the scraps as the ball bounced away from the lineout, then Chris Farrell was skinned by May’s sublime footwork before he dinked the ball ahead, while James Lowe’s effort in tracking back was substandard.
The lineout issues weren’t all on Kelleher and his throwing, of course, and England also deserve credit for two steals as they put pressure on, while the inexperience of James Ryan as a caller did seem apparent as the Leinster hooker was asked to fire some demanding darts to the middle and tail under pressure.
But the entire lineout and maul drill seemed off for Ireland and given that it was so damaging in Paris in the Six Nations too only very recently, assistant coach Simon Easterby will be feeling pressure to turn things around quickly in that area.
Ireland were second best at Twickenham.

The set-piece has been an unhappy one against England on the last four occasions and even for their first try yesterday, penalty concessions and scrum and maul time were the ‘ins’ for the home side into the Ireland 22,  where Owen Farrell used a penalty advantage to give May a one-on-one contest against Hugo Keenan wide on the right. 
Those five-pointers aside, England didn’t do much in an attacking sense as they instead looked entirely happy to smother the life out of Ireland with their superb defence, making 238 tackles as Ireland held possession for 19 minutes and 38 seconds. Those are very high numbers indeed.
Ireland actually started the game brightly and three kicks behind England applied pressure but Farrell’s men then seemingly became over-focused on breaking the defence down with ball in hand. With Byrne set up deep against the English linespeed, there were passages where the defence seemed comfortable.
Not until later in the game, first with Byrne’s grubber for a Farrell near-try and then the consolation score from Jacob Stockdale off Billy Burns’ excellent chip kick did we really see more of that attacking kicking used effectively. 
Farrell could point out that Ireland made six linebreaks to England’s three and offloaded five times to England’s one, while he could argue that had Ireland been able to finish when Keith Earls broke off Jamison Gibson-Park’s snipe and offload in the 30th minute, it might have been a very different story.

The truth is we will never know but most will have come away from this game sensing that England probably had a little more if they needed it.
That Earls linebreak left Ireland only a few metres out but Billy Vunipola produced a questionable turnover penalty – there was little evidence of a clear release – in one of the damaging circumstances of a breakdown turnover against Ireland.
Pascal Gaüzère’s decision-making did perhaps lean towards rewarding England [although they actually conceded 13 penalties to Ireland's 12] but that tends to happen when a team is generally looking the more dominant overall. Ireland’s own lack of accuracy in their cleanout work was obviously a major contributing factor too, leaving Farrell and co. with another area that needs attention.
In the end, we come away from this game with the main pre-match impression confirmed: England are a better team than Ireland. 
James Ryan is clapped off by England.

The vehement message from within the Ireland camp was that the gap is closing.
“I thought that was a much better performance than the last time we were here,” said James Ryan after his first outing as Ireland captain.
“We had a go and we definitely fired some shots. I thought the team spirit was really good. We’re just going to build on that and next time we’re going to look to fire even more shots.
“So, yeah, I thought there was good character there today. I think we’ll get loads from it.”

372,213,"Explainer: Why it's taken a pandemic to get sick pay back on the government agenda",https://www.thejournal.ie/explainer-statutory-sick-pay-5271972-Nov2020/,"IT TOOK AN unprecedented public health crisis to draw attention to it but at long last, Ireland’s sick pay regime is finally set for an overhaul.
This week, the government launched a public consultation on sick pay, the first step in a process towards implementing a statutory right to sick pay and enshrining it in legislation.
But why exactly has it taken so long and why is Ireland considered an outlier in a European context when it comes to this issue?
To find out, we spoke to employment law expert Karen Killalea, partner and head of the employment team at Maples and Calder, the Maples Group’s Law firm in Ireland.
What’s the current legal situation?
As it stands currently, the vast majority of Irish employers are not legally obligated to offer paid sick leave to workers.
That doesn’t mean that huge swathes of the working population have no access to sick pay.
As Killalea explains, outside of the law itself, there are “a number of other sources of obligations” for employers, not least contracts of employment, which often guarantee access to sick pay arrangements.
All permanent public sector workers have a right to sick pay guaranteed by their contracts, she says, “an enormous cohort” within the Irish labour force.
Within the private sector then, certain industries are regulated by Sectoral Employment Orders.
“Those are sort of almost like national collective bargaining agreements,” Killalea explains — legally binding rules that determine the terms of employment within certain industries.
“They apply, for example, across the construction sector; across mechanical and electrical engineering and they cover thousands of people. They also provide for sick pay,” she says.
Finally, many workers within the private sector — mostly in white-collar industries — will have access to sick pay guaranteed by their contracts.
Overall, just about half of private sector workers have access to it through contractual arrangements, she says.
But again, because there is no legal obligation, Killalea explains it means that the vast majority of private sector workers “are dependent on the benevolence of their employer” to pay them for sick days. 
So who does that leave out?
Mostly low-paid, part-time or casual private-sector workers.
The obvious iniquity of this is that precarious and low-paid workers are often not financially capable of taking unpaid leave, meaning they’re forced to work when they’re ill.
These issues are, of course, heightened by the pandemic.
Earlier this week, deputy chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn highlighted the fact that some workers are still turning up for their jobs even though they’re displaying symptoms of Covid.
It’s obvious that for many people, concerns about pay or whether they’ll lose their job if they fail to show up override public health advice.
Killalea says, “People who are working in casual employment; low-paid work, they’re definitely vulnerable… I think if there’s one thing that the pandemic is teaching us that it is a false economy to incentivise people to attend work when they’re sick.” 
So what happens if I’m sick but my employer doesn’t provide sick pay?
You can avail of a State illness benefit.
The normal weekly rate of Illness benefit is €203 per week or €31.33 per day. 
The scheme is available to anyone under the pension age who has paid 26 weeks of PRSI contributions in the relevant tax year, and 26 weeks of PRSI contributions paid in the previous tax year.
An enhanced Covid-linked version of the scheme was rolled out earlier this year. 
Designed to incentivise workers who are diagnosed with the coronavirus or forced to self-isolate to stay at home rather than come into work, the scheme pays out at €350 per week.
Both employees and self-employed people can qualify for the COVID-19 enhanced Illness Benefit.
What do other countries do?
Within Europe, Ireland is an outlier when it comes to statutory sick pay.
Most of our continental neighbours place some kind of statutory obligation upon employers to pay workers for sick leave. 
German employers are required to pay the sick workers’ full wage for up to six weeks, tapering then to 70% of the worker’s salary for a maximum of 78 weeks. 
Denmark has a statutory sick pay system for up to nine months and in Portugal, it extends up to three years.
In many cases, the state will step in to cover some of the cost to the employer.
Killalea says, “In Germany, there is quite a significant government subsidy [to the employer] for statutory sick pay. So in other words, the system in Germany recognises the ability of the employer to pay and I think that’s probably a very sensible approach.”
It’s slightly different in the UK, where employers cover the full cost of sick pay.
“It’s not a very high level of sick pay. It’s relatively modest, but it does extend for up to 28 weeks.” 
Italy and France also operate sick pay systems where employers contribute to the cost of sick pay.
Why is Ireland so far behind on this issue?
Well, for a combination of reasons.
For one, as Killalea points out, compared to France or Germany, for example, a much smaller proportion of the working population here are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
Ireland has a broadly voluntary industrial relations system. This means that employers are not obliged to recognise or to negotiate with trade unions although everyone is free to join one.
“Vast swathes of private sector employees in continental Europe are already covered by heavily negotiated collective agreements,” Killalea says.
By contrast, contract negotiations in Ireland tend to me a lot more “ad hoc”.
What are the other reasons?
Politics, mainly.
In 2012, Joan Burton as Minister for Social Protection began a public consultation on introducing a statutory sick pay model.

As Dr Laura Bambrick, social policy officer at the Irish Congress of Trade Unions highlighted recently, it was actually the Troika — the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission — who raised the issue during the bailout years.
“They encouraged reform that would require employers to pay for the first two to four weeks of sickness, bringing an end to the unusual practice of the state picking up the full cost” through illness benefits.
Unfortunately, the conversation kicked off a major row within the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition government of the time. 
The proposals were also met with fierce opposition from business lobbyists and representative groups like IBEC, who argued against forcing employers to foot the bill.
Widely expected to be introduced in the 2013 Budget, the plan eventually fell by the wayside.
It took a pandemic to put the issue back on the political agenda.
So what’s happening now?
In September, the Labour Party introduced a private members bill.
Entitled ‘Sick Leave and Parental Leave (Covid-19) Bill 2020’, the proposed legislation would entitle employees to a maximum of 30 days of paid sick leave “at the employee’s normal weekly rate of pay”. 
Separately, about a month later, the Oireachtas Committee on Covid-19 Response produced a report, which called for statutory sick pay to be rolled out to protect low-paid workers in high-risk industries like meat processing.
But the government decided to delay a debate on the Labour bill to facilitate a public consultation on the issue.
What is the public consultation and what will happen next?
Beginning this week and ending on 18 December, the public consultation will hear from trade unions and employers groups.
At the end of this process, a report will be produced informed by submissions from the various parties.
Although the exact timeline is yet to be finalised, it will likely be six months before any recommendations will be made
“What will happen is that the views will be taken into consideration. A costing will have to be done,” Killalea explains.
“The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, obviously will be key in reviewing this, and then typically at the end of that, a report is produced, which will summarise the consultation.”
At the end of all of that, the government will either decide to amend the Labour Party’s bill or introduce one of its own, based on the consultation.
Commenting on the launch of the consultation process, Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise Leo Varadkar said the government is committed to introducing new legislation as soon as possible.
“This needs to change and I am committed to introducing a statutory sick pay scheme that works for employees and employers as quickly as possible,” he said.
The government has committed to enacting statutory sick pay legislation by the end of 2021.

Why might you be served 16 ounce pint in an Irish pub rather than 20 ounce?
A legal loophole means pubs can pay less tax if if a certain percentage of their drinks are not sold as full pints.
Most pints are actually 16 ounce - liquid, that is, and there can be as as much as four ounces of foam in the head of a pint.

Irish bartenders have shaky hands and often spill exactly four fluid ounces of your beer.
Craft beers, in particular American craft beers, are often served in a smaller glass.

Meath 0-9
FOR THE 10th straight year Dublin have been crowned champions of Leinster and their dominance has never looked more pronounced.
On a night when the 100th year anniversary of Bloody Sunday was marked in Croke Park with a pre-game ceremony, the main event offered little entertainment. 
Dublin had 16 points to spare over the Royals in last year’s final and despite the talk that the gap had been narrowed in the intervening 18 months, the 21-point margin here suggests otherwise.
A late red card to Cormac Costello was the main talking point from a drab game. He only arrived onto the field in the 58th minute and nine minutes later had received his marching orders for an off the ball incident. 
According to Dessie Farrell after the game, Costello was dismissed for something he said to an official.

Unless an appeal is successful he’ll miss the All-Ireland semi-final against the Ulster champions. On current form Farrell’s main concern will be around whether they’ll arrive into that game undercooked such is the paucity of the challenge they’ve faced in Leinster. 
It took Meath 63 minutes to better their tally of four points from last year’s Leinster final. Dublin swallowed them up at the back and completely shut down the Meath forward line that had scored 12 goals in the previous two games.
They eventually finished with 0-9, though the game was probably over as a contest after Dean Rock’s eight minute goal. 
Dublin almost look like a better side without the crowd because their on-field communication is so good. Captain Stephen Cluxton was a vocal presence, roaring ‘kick-out, kick-out’ to his team-mates every time they were about to get a shot away. 
The Sky Blues almost look insulted by the pre-match talk that Meath would run them close.
The Royals kicked the first score of the game and were still level by the seventh minute when they pressed high on a Dublin kick-out. Cluxton bombed his kick-out down the middle on top of Con O’Callaghan, who played mostly at centre-forward. 
Dublin clearly expected a heavy Meath press and they dragged bodies into their own half, leaving oceans of space either side of O’Callaghan. It was the first of four kick-outs he fetched in the game.
Niall Scully raced past the Cuala man and forwarded it onto Brian Fenton. Dean Rock peeled off to the back post and received the pass for a simple finish that has become Dublin’s hallmark. 
By the interval, Dublin’s all-time leading scorer had 1-5 on the board after a few sweetly struck placed balls. He finished the game with 1-7. Sean Bugler grabbed his second goal in as many games, fisting in a chance he fashioned himself after playing a one-two with Kilkenny. 
The game was practically over at that stage. Niall Scully, Kilkenny and O’Callaghan all added points to leave Dublin in an unassailable 2-12 to 0-2 half-time lead.
They lost Jonny Cooper to a foot injury before the start of the second-half, but the introduction of Brian Howard hardly weakened Dublin. By the 43rd minute, two of Meath full-back line had been replaced, indicating their struggles against the Dublin attack. 
John Small broke forward for a point and O’Callaghan added another. Kilkenny had an opportunity to go for goal when Fenton slipped him through, but he showed mercy on Meath and popped it over. 
The Castleknock man mainly played at full-forward and finished with 0-4, adding to the 1-9 he clipped in the previous two outings.

Cluxton made a good save to deny Wallace but Dublin counter-attacked immediately.
Cormac Costello, only off the bench minutes earlier, was speeding through for a certain goal chance when he was downed by Ronan Jones. The offender shipped a black card and Meath were down to 14 men for the remaining 10 minutes of normal time. 
Meath scored more in the last 10 minutes than they did in the previous 60.

375,214,"Opinion: ‘Self-regulation is no regulation’ - what the Lobbying Act has failed to tackle",https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/lobbying-act-abroad-5268892-Nov2020/,"A JUNIOR MINISTER loses his seat. He then gets elected to the Seanad. He subsequently quits the Seanad to take up a new job as CEO of a powerful lobbyist group within the industry he used to regulate as Minster. Surely there’s a law against that?
There is – and to be clear, the aforementioned former junior minister has confirmed he will not be lobbying until the 12-month cooling-off period has passed.
However, the debate has highlighted that while Ireland’s Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 has been held up as the gold standard, there are no sanctions in the act for failure to comply with the rules it sets out.
Our colleagues at Noteworthy want to connect the dots between the State and former officials turned lobbyists. Support this project here.
Sherry Perreault, head of ethics and lobbying regulation at the Standards Commission (SIPO), has made repeated calls to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to increase SIPO’s powers in this regard. These calls have been persistently disregarded.
If the regulator cannot effectively investigate such matters, then it’s a regulator in name only and there is concern that a regulator without teeth could allow ex-politicians to interpret the legislation themselves.
International lobbying
If you think that the light touch with the cooling-off period is worrying, then the issue of international lobbying is quite frankly alarming.
The 2015 Act only legislates for lobbying that takes place within Ireland. If a public official is lobbied while abroad there is no regulation to oversee this. Lobbyists don’t even have to tell SIPO that the meeting took place. Instead, international lobbyists are merely encouraged to disclose such information, without any legal obligations whatsoever. 
This issue was highlighted on several occasions during the development of the legislation to Brendan Howlin, then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform who guided the legislation through the Oireachtas. 
Amendments were proposed that would have removed the loophole which allows for an international lobbyist to influence Irish politicians without informing the regulator and suffer no consequences.
Deputy Seán Fleming explicitly attempted to close this loophole during a debate on the Bill. He proposed that when a public official is lobbied outside of the State, they “shall be obliged to register the fact” and “shall provide the necessary information [to SIPO] for inclusion in the register”.
Fleming supported his argument by referencing the potential for the then-Minister for Finance Michael Noonan to be lobbied by the financial sector at the 2014 meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos that “cannot be captured under this legislation”. 
Trusting the fox to guard the hen house
During the debate in the Select Sub-Committee on Public Expenditure and Reform, Minister Howlin said that Fleming was “staying up too late at night thinking about these difficult cases”.
Most interesting during this debate was his defence that placing the obligation to report on public officials when they were lobbied abroad was “a burden which [Howlin] would not be keen on taking on, and [he] would not be keen to place it on a range of colleagues”.
Rather than make it an explicit obligation for public officials to report overseas lobbying, Howlin’s opinion was that the onus should rest with the lobbyist.

The expectation was that overseas lobbyists would register, with Howlin citing “reputational issues” as a promising deterrent. This effectively transferred the interest of the Irish people away from public officials and staff away to private foreign companies.
The golden umbrella
Reforming lobbying legislation is difficult for any administration. Developing legislation that captures all communications appears to be practically unattainable. That’s not to say that it’s not worth a better shot.
International lobbying of Irish public officials must be regulated and transparent. The Irish public needs to know exactly who is lobbying our politicians so as to limit undue influence from powerful corporations at events such as Davos.
The regulator must have the power to enforce the legislation. Both public officials and lobbyists must be held to account for not adhering to it.
Unregulated lobbying poses a serious threat to democracy and political legitimacy because it happens in the shadows. 
Paying lip service to the legislation means that both parties can act with impunity, all protected by the umbrella of having the ‘gold standard’ legislation.

It’s a time when people think a bit more about helping the less fortunate. In a year when most people are just hoping to be able to see their families for Christmas, and shopping is curtailed, that may be a more important theme. 
Because of restrictions prompted by the Covid-19 pandemic, Christmas fundraising events have been cancelled, so charities have to ask for funding in a different way.  
Here are some of the charities that have begun their Christmas appeals for donations. We will add to it in the run up to Christmas.
1. Aware’s Christmas 5K
The annual Aware Christmas 5K was launched during the week, urging people to come together ‘virtually’ and take on a 5K challenge in support of mental health.
Aware has said it has seen a dramatic increase in demand for its services since March. The NGO’s services include a support line and support mail service, which operate 365 days a year. Aware also delivers a range of wellbeing programmes.
The charity is hoping that the Aware Christmas 5K will raise funds to ensure the organisation can continue to deliver its free support, education and information services.
The challenge runs from Fri 11 – Sun 13 December, and costs €25 to enter.
Participants can walk, run or jog the 5K distance close to home. Private companies are also encouraged to get involved.

During the week, 11-year-old Symone turned on the Christmas lights on Grafton Street, Henry Street, and Capel Street, among others.
This was part of an initiative with Dublin Town, to help promote local, independent businesses in the run up to Christmas, and raise money for Temple Street Children’s Hospital. 
Here are ways you can donate toys or funds to the children’s hospital:
You can physically donate toys to Temple Street by dropping them off to our hospital
Make a donation to our play department and help us to provide our patients with toys, activities and events throughout the year
Support us by purchasing vouchers for our patients such as Penny’s, Smyth’s & One4All vouchers
Or make a half & half donation – due to current restrictions it may be easier for your company or community to make a smaller toy donation than usual and make a donation to the play department.

The Cork and Kerry branch of the poverty and housing charity has said that over 200 people in Cork are making calls to them daily asking for assistance in the run-up to Christmas.
It said that the “staggering” number of calls to the regional office come as the charity says it’s facing unprecedented fundraising challenges this year because of Covid-19.
The charity has expressed concerns that up to 40% of its income from its core fundraising could be lost this year as a result of the pandemic, with their annual collections in mid-December set to be significantly reduced, if allowed to take place at all.

The cancer community centre based in Bray offers support and services to people affected by cancer free of charge, and supports families affected by cancer all over Ireland.
In order to continue its helpline in the run up to Christmas, the charity has produced a book called ‘The Music of What Happens’ published by New Island books.
It features a wide range of stories and poems from many Irish writers including a previously unpublished story by the late author Emma Hannigan who passed away in 2018.

Counter-attacking goals in each half from Son Heung-min and substitute Giovani Lo Celso handed Spurs a statement victory despite Pep Guardiola’s men dominating possession in the capital.
The City boss signed a contract extension this week, but was not able to toast it with three points after his team failed to breakdown the disciplined and organised hosts.
It meant Mourinho, who celebrated a year in charge of Tottenham on Friday, again got one over his old rival to send the north Londoners back to the top of the table for at least 24 hours.
Both clubs paid tribute to the late Ray Clemence before kick-off with a minute’s applause while Spurs’ players wore black armbands for their former goalkeeper, who won trophies at White Hart Lane and with Liverpool.
Mourinho had predicted Raheem Sterling would start for City despite being unavailable for England due to a calf injury, but he was only named on the bench where he was joined by the fit again Sergio Aguero.
Without their number seven, Guardiola recalled Riyad Mahrez while Bernardo Silva came in for Ilkay Gundogan and yet it was at the other end of the pitch where familiar problems reared their ugly head.
Only five minutes had been played when Tanguy Ndombele threaded a pass into the path of Son, who ran into space vacated by Aymeric Laporte and Ruben Dias and slotted through the legs of the onrushing Ederson for his ninth league goal of the campaign.
It was a poor lapse in concentration for the visitors, who switched off and were then not tight enough to the in-form South Korean.
City may have been level with nine on the clock, but Toby Alderweireld impressively denied Gabriel Jesus inside the area before the Brazilian inadvertedly blocked a goalbound shot by captain Kevin De Bruyne.
The ball was in the away net again in the 13th minute; yet Kane had strayed into an offside position after a selfless Son pass.
Spurs were happy for City to control possession with Mourinho watching his side produce the type of disciplined display which has become his trademark.

A momentary drop in focus was all Guardiola’s side would need and they thought it arrived with 27 on the clock.
Rodri’s cross into the area came through to Jesus, who set up the unmarked Laporte and the French defender drilled past Hugo Lloris from inside the area to make it 1-1.
No one had picked up the centre-back but Tottenham were saved by the pitchside monitor after VAR recommended Mike Dean use the technology to review if Jesus had used his arm to control the ball and City’s number nine duly had.
The frustration of the away side was visible at half-time and even though Mahrez tested Lloris early into the second period, it was routine for the Spurs captain.
Eric Dier and Alderweireld produced timely interventions on the hour mark in the face of relentless pressure before Mourinho replaced the excellent Ndombele with Lo Celso in the 65th minute.
It was an inspired change with the Argentinian scoring 35 seconds into his arrival from another Kane assist.
Alderweireld found the England skipper in the middle of the pitch, who spotted Lo Celso had run away from De Bruyne and after the substitute took a touch into the area, he steered into the corner for his first ever Premier League goal.
Mourinho was able to celebrate another masterstroke and Tottenham were within touching distance of a statement win.
Guardiola responded by introducing England duo Sterling and Phil Foden, but the closest they came was when Lloris produced a point-blank save from a Dias header.
It was not all positive for Spurs who saw Alderweireld leave the pitch with an injury nine minutes from time, but they have replaced Chelsea at the summit and extended their unbeaten league run to eight games.
For City, in spite of a match in hand, they now trail the leaders by eight points and continue to lack a clinical edge in both boxes.","Goals from Son Heung-Min and Giovani Lo Celso sealed a victory.",1,0,0,36153,"Sat 7:59 PM"

The partial skeletons were found during excavation of an elegant villa on the outskirts of the ancient Roman city that was destroyed by the eruption in 79AD.
It is the same area where a stable with the remains of three harnessed horses was excavated in 2017.
Pompeii officials said the two men apparently escaped the initial fall of ash, then succumbed to a powerful volcanic blast that took place the following day.
Source: PA
Casts were created of the entire skeletons, taking advantage of the impressions the shape of the victims made in the hardened ash.
Judging by cranial bones and skull, one of the victims was a youth, probably aged 18 to 25, with a spinal column with compressed discs.
That finding led archaeologists to hypothesise that the young man did manual labour, like that of a slave.
The other victim, found nearby, had a robust bone structure, especially in his chest area, and probably was about 30 to 40 years old, the Pompeii officials said.
Both skeletons were found in a corridor, which led to a staircase to the upper level of the villa.

Based on the impression of fabric folds left in the ash layer, it appeared the younger man was wearing a short, pleated tunic, possibly of wool.
The older victim, in addition to wearing a tunic, appeared to have had a mantle over his left shoulder.

IRISH GOALKEEPER COACH Alan Kelly says he has never leaked dressing room information, and has hit out at what he sees as a “disgusting” media narrative around the reasons for his early departure from the recent international camp.
Information from the Irish dressing room appeared in the UK Daily Mail on Thursday, claiming players were upset at the political nature of a motivational video and pre-match team talk delivered by manager Stephen Kenny before last week’s defeat to England at Wembley. 
Goalkeeper coach Kelly left the camp the following Monday following a defeat to Wales.
In a statement released via the FAI that night, Kelly explained he declined to board the squad’s flight to Dublin for personal reasons as he suffers from asthma. 
In a personal statement on social media today, Kelly hit out at a supposed conflation of his exit from the camp with the leaking of information from the Irish dressing room. Kelly says he is “absolutely furious and disgusted” at the notion the stories are linked, and says “with 100% certainty” that he has never “bleated to the media in 35 years as a player and coach.”
“I recently made a difficult decision to put my health first & football second as I continued to work, travel, eat & sleep, in camp, with the Republic of Ireland national team during the recent International break”, reads the statement.
“Covid-19 was present in the camp & continuing to spread from person to person during this period. 
“I made the decision to ‘sit out’ the last match because the risk was becoming too high for me as an asthmatic. 
“I am now absolutely furious and disgusted with the narrative & innuendo being created in the media that this decision is somehow linked with stories leaked to the press out of OUR dressing room. 
“I can say with 100% certainty that I have never bleated to the media in 35 years as a player and coach & I’ve been in some pretty interesting dressing rooms. 
“This narrative is wholly and totally wrong & it should beg the question who is spreading & who is benefitting from this? What I can say is it’s not me. 
“I have been a loyal servant to Irish football for over 30 years and to now find my name & reputation being dragged through the mud is shameful.

“Enough is enough.”
Earlier today, James McClean criticised the leak in the Irish camp. McClean answered back to a newspaper report claiming he was among Irish players restless with recent issues in the Irish camp by posting on Instagram, “Didn’t want to public speak on the matter but this absolute gutter press…any issues within a camp should remain in a camp, nothing worse than a tout.” He concluded the post with a rat emoji.
The FAI are presently looking into a complaint from a member or members of the Irish camp regarding the material of Kenny’s pre-game presentation. It remains unclear who made a complaint to the FAI about what was said and/or shown in the dressing room, and indeed whether there was more than one complaint made. 
The42 understands the video was roughly three minutes long, and was a montage splicing previous Irish goals against England with scenes from Anglo-Irish history, including the Easter Rising.  
Outgoing FAI CEO Gary Owens is looking into the matter, and is speaking with a number of people involved to establish the facts of the situation. Owens spoke with Kenny yesterday, in what has been described as a “positive” meeting for the Irish boss, and there is no suggestion his job is in jeopardy. 
It’s understood Owens is seeking to speak with many more people involved, and will then decide whether the matter is worth referring to the full board. 
Asked about Kelly’s departure on Tuesday, Kenny said, “I think it was probably connected to the positive tests of Matt Doherty and James McClean. That was probably an influence. To try and look for something else is not right. He just spoke and gave an honest reason.” 
The FAI conducted an extra round of Covid tests prior to boarding the flight, and it returned positive cases for players James McClean and Matt Doherty. All other members on the flight were negative, and they all tested negative again in Dublin the following day.
Kelly made 34 appearances for Ireland between 1993 and 2002, and was the only member of the backroom staff appointed by Mick McCarthy to be retained by Stephen Kenny.

THE SENSE OF familiarity will be most hurtful of all for Ireland.
Andy Farrell’s men were a clear second-best in their fourth consecutive defeat to Eddie Jones’ side in a game where didn’t fire a shot until the contest was over.
England’s defence was brilliant but they didn’t even need to be at their best to overcome an Ireland side that was very poor at the scrum, breakdown, and in their decision-making. The lineout and maul, meanwhile, was a horror show for James Ryan and co.
England had too much quality for Ireland.
Source: Craig Mercer/INPHO
Led by the dominant Maro Itoje, England smothered Ireland’s attack but Farrell’s side did at least avoid being nilled thanks to a late try from Jacob Stockdale off a clever chip kick from replacement out-half Billy Burns.
Ireland did keep battling in the second half, having trailed 12-0 at half time, but they never had the quality to genuinely worry the English, who remain top of Group A in the Autumn Nations Cup.
Eddie Jones will likely be a little frustrated that England didn’t rack up a bigger scoreline after two first-half tries from right wing Jonny May, the second of them a stunning effort on turnover that started inside his own 22.
For Ireland, it will be a miserable journey home after their latest failure against the English. James Ryan’s first outing as captain was a very tough one as he contributed to Ireland’s damaging penalty count but there weren’t any particularly strong individual performances from the Irish side.
Farrell’s men dominated the possession stakes but only rarely stretched the English defence as the likes of Itoje, Tom Curry, Sam Underhill, and Kyle Sinckler repeatedly cut them down with some stunning tackling. The English excelled at the breakdown too and while they had some favourable calls in that area, Ireland’s work there was poor.
Ireland face Georgia next up in this Autumn Nations Cup so should get back to winning ways in Dublin next weekend but the reality is that there is still a big gap in quality to the best teams like England.
Jonny May scores two first-half tries.
Source: Craig Mercer/INPHO
Ireland had a decent start as they used their kicking game to pose questions to the English defence but the early signs at set-piece were ominous and Jones’ men gradually began to take control.
They threatened off a quick-tap penalty in the ninth minute only for CJ Stander to get a hand to Farrell’s offload. The set-piece issues at scrum and lineout were seriously harmful for Ireland and helped provide the platform for England’s opening score. 
The home side very nearly went over from a five-metre lineout maul before they used penalty advantage to cross kick off Farrell wide to the right, where Jonny May leaped above the isolated Hugo Keenan to gather and dot down.
The second England score came four minutes later from another Irish lineout failure – Kelleher’s throw flying over and beyond Peter O’Mahony as England sparked on the counter-attack as the bouncing ball eluded Ross Byrne.
The English shifted it wide left to May inside his own 22 and he skinned Chris Farrell to break upfield, chipping ahead and then nudging the ball on as he beat a lazy Irish trackback for a stunning solo score converted by Farrell.
The English defence was hitting hard to deny momentum although there was brief hope as Keith Earls broke clear off a snipe and offload from scrum-half Jamison Gibson-Park, only for Billy Vunipola to win a turnover penalty – one of several in the first half from England.

Jones would have been frustrated that his men didn’t end the half with a third try as they pressured Ireland in their 22. First, O’Mahony and the Irish pack did well to force a maul turnover and then the TMO ruled out a possible Underhill score. That came from a bizarre Ireland exit play that saw Gibson-Park snared by the English flanker, who illegally stripped the ball on the ground after his tackle.
Trailing 12-0, Ireland needed an excellent start to the second half but instead conceded another three points as TMO Nigel Owens intervened to call a penalty against Quinn Roux for grabbing Tom Curry around the neck near a ruck. Farrell extended the English lead.

Keenan’s aerial win under a Byrne garryowen soon gave Ireland hope in attack but Gibson-Park followed up with a dire kick that bounced over the deadball line.  
Farrell pushed the scoreline out to 18-0 in the 52nd minute when referee Pascal Gaüzère pinged Ireland skipper Ryan for going off his feet at the breakdown, just after Farrell had used his bench to get Conor Murray, Iain Henderson, and Rob Herring on.
A poor pass from Murray saw Henderson knock-on in their first real involvement as Ireland struggled to get any grip on the game, although a Doris turnover penalty relieved pressure heading towards the final quarter. 
And a scrum penalty in the 61st minute gave Ireland a five-metre platform but England’s  defence bullied Ireland once again and the magnificent Itoje produced another turnover penalty at the breakdown.
Maro Itoje was superb for England.
Source: Billy Stickland/INPHO
Chris Farrell came close to scoring for Ireland with just over 10 minutes left, gathering a Byrne grubber kick on penalty advantage, but the TMO review confirmed that Henry Slade had held him up over the tryline. 
The sustained Irish pressure ended with another error from the Irish pack, the ball bobbling out the back of the subsequent five-metre maul and England swooping for yet another turnover penalty. 
But Ireland did manage a consolation score as replacement out-half Burns dinked a lovely kick over the top for Stockdale to gather on the full and swerve past the last defender for a converted score. 
That try doesn’t gloss over the reality of the English dominance.

Tipperary 2-24
Declan Rooney reports from the Gaelic Grounds 
AIDAN HARTE STRUCK the winning goal for Galway three minutes from time to send Shane O’Neill’s side into an All-Ireland semi-final with Limerick next week.
Tipperary looked certain winners when they led by six points shortly after the break, but with Cathal Mannion leading the line well for Galway they raced back into the game.
Seamus Callanan and Patrick Maher goaled for Tipperary in the first half, but crucially Brian Concannon and Cathal Mannion also hit the net for Galway, who made the most of their extra man in the closing stages following Cathal Barrett’s sending off.
Both teams lined out with a spare player in front of the full-back line with David Burke handed the duty for Galway, while Padraic Maher swept for Tipperary.
And although Galway got off the mark inside the first minute when Joe Canning clipped over a free, it was at the other end that all the early action happened. Daithí Burke picked up Tipperary captain Seamus Callanan, but the defender struggled to keep the Drom-Inch man quiet in the first ten minutes. 
Jason Forde hit Tipp’s first point after four minutes, but a slip from Daithí Burke allowed Callanan to cut back on his right side and he hit the net for a 1-1 to 0-2 lead.
Wearing number eight, Noel McGrath also started in the full-forward line and he scored the first of four first-half points, before Callanan won a free off Daithí Burke to put his side four points clear.
Tipperary needed Brian Hogan to to pull off a great save to deny Brian Concannon after ten minutes, but Canning followed it up with a free, while Conor Cooney sent Cathal Mannon in for a brilliant goal to level the scores again. Points from Joseph Cooney and Canning out Galway 1-5 to 1-3 at the water break.
With Noel McGrath very dangerous Tipp continued to stay in touch, but Galway pulled three clear when Conor Whelan sent Concannon in for Galway’s second goal in the 21st minute. A couple of missed frees from Joe Canning meant Galway didn’t pull clear as they should have, and after Noel McGrath and Forde hit good points, Alan Flynn landed a leveller for the Munster side.
Two minutes from half-time Tipperary made the most of another slip in the Galway defence to strike their second goal, with Patrick ‘Bonner’ Maher getting the finishing touch after two good Eanna Murphy saves, which gave them a 2-13 to 2-9 lead at half-time.
Galway manager Shane O’Neill made a couple of big calls at the break, withdrawing Johnny Coen and David Burke, but it was Tipperary that added to their lead with Forde and Michael Breen on target.
Galway warmly welcomed a great Cathal Mannion point and a couple of Canning frees – they second following a cynical pull back by Ronan Maher on Whelan – but Tipp had a strong reply through Dan McCormack.
Cathal Mannion continued to carry the Galway challenge with a great score on the turn hear halfway, but Callanan scored an even better one at the other end when he got out in front of Daithí Burke again to make it 2-17 to 2-13. 
Following a yellow card at the end of the first half, Cathal Barrett picked up his second for a foul on Concannon 18 minutes from time, and from the free Canning cut Tipp’s lead to a point.

A Forde free was cancelled out by a sweet Canning sideline cut, and the Portumna man levelled the game again with a well struck free from the right seven minutes from time.
Willie Connors reclaimed the advantage for Tipperary, before Ronan Maher converted a free with his first shot at the posts all day.
But three minutes from time substitutes Flynn and Tuohey linked up and sent Harte in on goal and his bullet shot from distance found the net and proved to be the winner.

The UK has said the agreement paves the way for negotiations to begin next year on a new comprehensive deal with Canada, which has been touted as one of the benefits of leaving the EU.
Boris Johnson and Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau sealed the “agreement in principle” in a video call today, the Department for International Trade (DIT) said.
The agreement does not give any new benefits to businesses but rolls over the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement reached by the EU and Canada after seven years of negotiations.
Welcoming the continuity deal, Trudeau suggested a new comprehensive trade agreement with the UK would take several years to negotiate.
‘Maximise trade opportunities’
Industry groups expressed relief that businesses will not face higher trade tariffs with Canada next month but warned that similar deals were urgently needed.
Johnson said the extension was “a fantastic agreement for Britain”, adding: “Our negotiators have been working flat out to secure trade deals for the UK and from as early next year we have agreed to start work on a new, bespoke trade deal with Canada that will go even further in meeting the needs of our economy.”
Speaking during the video call, which also included International Trade Secretary Liz Truss and her counterpart Mary NG, Trudeau said the deal meant that “now we get to continue to work on a bespoke agreement, a comprehensive agreement over the coming years that will really maximise our trade opportunities and boost things for everyone”.
British Chambers of Commerce director general Adam Marshall said the deal “will be warmly welcomed” but warned that similar continuity deals were urgently needed with other key markets, including Turkey and Singapore, to avoid “a damaging cliff edge for both importers and exporters”.

And he repeated his call for a deal to be struck with the EU , describing that as the “single most critical trade agreement our business communities need”.
Federation of Small Businesses chairman Mike Cherry said: “There was always a danger that the end of the transition period would mean losing wider international market access that we enjoyed as part of EU membership.
“The fact that this new agreement upholds the small business chapter that was previously in place is very welcome. We look forward to such chapters being at the centre of all future UK trade deals.”
Confederation of British Industry director-general Josh Hardie said it was “great news for businesses” and that the agreement can “lay the foundations for an even deeper trade agreement”.
Before it is formally signed, the UK-Canada Trade Continuity Agreement will be subject to final legal checks.","Business groups welcomed the announcement but warned that firms face a ‘cliff edge’ without deals with the EU and other nations.",7,0,0,33152,"Sat 4:08 PM"

Speaking to RTÉ’s Saturday with Katie Hannon, CEO of the Restaurants Association of Ireland (RAI) said 30% of the sector’s annual income comes in December.
“It is actually in a very precarious position where we could see a complete and total collapse of our industry in January if we’re not allowed to open for December,” he said.
Cummins said banks are “moving in on businesses” to make sure they pay their loans and landlords are looking for rent because they have to pay their mortgages.
“Over the next five days, the politicians need to, in our opinion, give us a clear definitive answer and allow us to open in a safe controlled manner so that we can get the thousands of workers that want to get back to work in December, so they can have a Christmas to look forward to”
He said restaurateurs want to be able to open their indoor spaces because “outdoor dining doesn’t work for our industry at all”.
Cummins said if the government does not allow hospitality to open, socialising in December will still happen but in less controlled environments such as households.
“That’s a recipe for disaster in our opinion,” he said.
Also speaking on the show this morning, Dr Tomás Ryan, associate professor at the school of biochemistry and immunology at Trinity College Dublin, warned that allowing restaurants to re-open at a time when there is a high level of the virus in the community could result in a surge in cases in January.
“There is no point in opening for a week or two in the Christmas season in a distanced matter if we are at hundreds of cases a day because the current situation is that by the first of December, we will be somewhere between 200 and 250 cases a day,” he said.
“We won’t be at the target of 100 cases a day until the middle or the end of the third week of December, and even 100 cases a day is quite a lot.
“So if we open up on the 1st of December with hundreds of cases a day, and we allow restaurants to open at that point in time, we could be at up to 1000 cases a day by New Year’s.”

He said he acknowledged the efforts made by the hospitality sector to make their premises as safe as possible, but said there is evidence of super-spreader events in restaurants. 
“We know internationally that restaurants are a site for super-spreader events – and this is a key point – when you have a large number of the virus in the community.
“So if you want to make restaurants safe, if you want to open them up, you need to get the virus down to very low levels, ideally to single digit levels. And we have done that in Ireland, it is realistic, we’ve done it before.
“If we get the virus down to single digit numbers per day, and we keep them down, then you can have a situation where restaurants can open and then hopefully eventually wet pubs can open and without a third wave and without a third lockdown if that’s managed correctly.”","The sector has warned it will lose out on 30% of its annual income.",23,0,0,32174,"Sat 2:29 PM"

THE ISLAMIC STATE group has claimed responsibility for the deadly Kabul attack that has killed eight people and injured 31 after a barrage of rockets hit the Afghan capital.
The rockets hit various parts of central and north Kabul – including near the heavily fortified Green Zone that houses embassies and international companies – just before 9:00 am local time.
“The terrorists fired 23 rockets on the city of Kabul. Based on the initial information, eight people were martyred, and 31 others were wounded,” said interior ministry spokesman Tariq Arian, who blamed the Taliban for the attack. A police source also confirmed the toll.
Photos and videos circulating online showed several buildings with damage to walls and windows, including at a large a medical complex.
The group confirmed that 28 Katyusha rockets were fired at the city earlier this morning. 
Recent attacks in Kabul, including two horrific assaults on educational institutions that killed nearly 50 people in recent weeks, follow a familiar pattern in the aftermath, with the Taliban denying any involvement while the Afghan government pins the blame on them or their proxies. 
“The rocket attack in Kabul city has nothing to do with the mujahideen of the Islamic Emirate,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said, using the insurgents’ name for Afghanistan.
“We do not blindly fire on public places.”

The Taliban are under pressure not to attack urban areas, having pledged not to do so under the terms of a US withdrawal deal signed in February.
Any acknowledgement of overt involvement in such incidents could slow the American pull-out, though outgoing US President Donald Trump has made clear that he wants US forces out regardless of the situation on the ground. 
The Islamic State group claimed the two attacks on educational centres, but Kabul said the Taliban’s ultra-violent Haqqani network was responsible.

The announcement comes from Ministers Darragh O’Brien and Malcolm Noonan during a week where a public campaign to save Dublin Zoo has raised over two million euro since it began on Wednesday.
The €1.1 million will be split amongst Dublin Zoo and Fota Island Wildlife Park, with the remaining €500,000 being used to support 69 small and medium-sized zoos across the country.
While Minister Noonan admitted that the State does not usually provide funding to the zoo sector, he made clear that this was due to the challenging year zoos have faced due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
“The outpouring of public support sparked by the Dublin Zoo appeal is testament to the great love so many people have for our zoos. I am mindful too of the staff, whose primary concern has always been the animals in their care,” said Noonan.
I do hope that Government can continue to support our zoos and aquariums until they can open their doors again and thrive.
Earlier in the week, Dublin Zoo’s director, Dr Christopher Schwitzer said that there was a risk that the attraction could close for good due to the impact of the pandemic.
He had expected cash reserves to last until next spring, “and not beyond right now”.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin pledged his support, taking to Twitter to confirm that the government would take action on funding issues.

A general view of Croke Park.

Behind this historic development is Na Gaeil Aeracha, which will be an inclusive place for one and all, based in Dublin initially with big plans to grow countrywide. 
The news first emerged at a webinar to help increase inclusion in sport, hosted by DCU’s Centre of Excellence for Diversity and Inclusion two weeks ago, but the club has been in the works for quite some time now.
Emma Loo is one of the seven founding members (the others being Karl Shannon, Luke Nolan, Craig Woods, Caoimhe Baxter, Tadhg Jenkins and Hugh Carr) and she explains the story behind it all.
“Na Gaeil Aeracha came about from a group of very like-minded people,” she tells The42. “We came from all different backgrounds and experiences, but we have one common passion and that was sport and GAA.
“We were just discussing it as friends and people who knew each other, and then another co-founder, Karl, he put out a very casual tweet just saying, ‘Okay, we have an idea to launch an LGBTQ+ inclusive club. Would anyone be interested? We’re thinking starting off, we’ll have all four codes; hurling, camogie football — ladies and men’s.’
And the tweet nearly has, I think, 1.5 thousand likes so far, the engagement rate was just phenomenal. We realised, ‘Wow, there’s a need for this. There’s a want.’
“We headed to the GAA and we were in contact with Geraldine McTavish, who’s the diversity and inclusion officer, and Dermot McCarthy from Sporting Pride.
“Between them both and so many other people, the club has just taken off. We’ve had so much support and we’re really happy that it’s taking off now.”
With 100 people or so on their mailing list already, and interest garnered in all four codes, the plan is to establish one team, at least, in each. Through the early days, the focus will be on social competitions but the idea is to contest at a higher level in the future. 
The registration process is front and centre at the moment, with paperwork and conversations plentiful but the club is focused on getting it all right with an Irish language officer and welfare officer key to the committee going forward.

“It’s not just, ‘Okay, here’s the team,’ we’re really making sure that we have so many facilities in place for people to be made feel welcome,” Loo notes, with keeping culture and tradition paramount.
“We do have huge aims and we want to be competitive and be recognised. We will be in Dublin for the moment but we’re hoping to expand right across and just know that everyone is absolutely welcome.”
That’s the key message coming from Na Gaeil Aeracha (the Gay Gaels as Béarla, or Rainbow Gaels). The tight-knit community feel is evident already, with many who walked away from sport keen to get back involved.
Many members of the LGBTQ+ community didn’t feel comfortable in sport when they were younger, whether that was down to being excluded, experiencing discrimination like homophobia or transphobia, or simply feeling like they didn’t belong.
And Loo stresses that this club is entirely inclusive and welcoming to one and all.
“From our own experiences, we noticed this, that we maybe all have experienced some discrimination in some form. It’s even important to note that some of our committee members, not everyone’s LGBTQ+ but we’ve all experienced some kind of discomfort or unwelcome-ness.
We definitely notice as well that there’s a huge drop-off rate with the LGBTQ+ community in sport.
“Homophobia and transphobia, it doesn’t just affect queer people, it affects everyone; heterosexual people as well, because it creates this environment where it’s unwelcoming. And no one wants to be a part of that if they don’t feel valued or welcomed.
We just know that we want to create a space where everyone is absolutely welcome, we’re on the same page and that there’s a mutual understanding and respect.”
Looking at Gaelic games on a wider scale, plenty of progress has been made over the past few years, particularly since the Marriage Referendum in 2015.
The GAA marched in the Dublin Pride Parade for the first time in its 36-year history, and employed a full-time diversity and inclusion officer last year, while many have spoken out and opened up — David Gough, Valerie Mulcahy, Dónal Óg Cusack and Nicole Owens a few who spring to mind, the former two holding positive meetings with GAA President John Horan.

But there’s no doubt that discrimination still exists; swept under the carpet rather than discussed out in the open. Former Dublin footballer and current Irish rugby player Lindsay Peat is one who has revealed homophobic sledging on the pitch in the past, as has referee Gough.
“Lindsay Peat would be a role model of mine for many reasons, not just for her sporting abilities, but for what she stands for,” Loo says.
“It’s people like Lindsay; they’re high profile, they’re role models and they’ll start the conversation to make people aware that you can’t just throw these sly derogatory terms at people and try and put them off their game. It’s not acceptable.
We need them to start the conversation so people can feel comfortable in their own clothes and they can start talking about it and standing up, whether that’s a fellow player or maybe a manager to say, ‘Okay, now this isn’t on. We need to respect people and stop discriminating against them.’”
While several ladies Gaelic games players have spoken out of late and been a lot more open about their sexuality, there is no active inter-county-playing openly-gay GAA player out there.
Dublin star Owens delved deeper into that with The42 last year and explored how and why the GAA is a hetero-normative environment for men but being gay is accepted in the women’s game.
Fear is a big factor, she feels. It’s physically impossible that there are no gay players, so it’s thought that people hide their sexuality. Loo is of the same opinion, though is pleased to see openness in the ladies’ game.
“More and more, you’re just seeing people being happy to express who they are. Even the littlest things, it doesn’t have to be someone of a high profile, it could be your clubmate. That will make a huge difference. Without even knowing, you’re making a huge change.
“I think for men, maybe they just need the support of their fellow team-mates. I think they’re put at such a high standard with this masculinity that they don’t feel safe. But absolutely, we just need time and role models and visibility.”
Gough, the first openly-gay top-level GAA match official, and former Cork star Mulcahy are certainly two of those role models, paving the way as the GAA marched in the Pride Parade last year.
That was a significant step, but Na Gaeil Aeracha is even more so, undoubtedly sparking conversations across the length and breadth of the country over the past few weeks.
“We do find a balance,” Loo concludes. “We have such an overwhelming response of positivity but of course, there’s always going to be a bit of backlash, or people will have opinions about us. But we’re mostly just focusing on the positives.
“There hasn’t been an LGBTQ+ GAA club before, there’s been Emerald Warriors with rugby and Dublin Devils with soccer but we’re just focusing on how we can make a change.
“We’re just a small group but with the likes of David and Valerie, we’re getting so much support and backing and even the GAA, they’re supporting us in every way possible.
“And we’re looking forward to maybe one day marching in the Dublin Pride Parade with everyone.”

398,209,"Trump attempts to leverage power of office to subvert Biden win",https://www.thejournal.ie/trump-subvert-biden-win-5274096-Nov2020/,"US PRESIDENT DONALD Trump sought to leverage the power of the Oval Office yesterday in an attempt to block President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, but his pleas to Michigan lawmakers to overturn the will of their constituents appeared to have left them unswayed.
Trump summoned a delegation of the battleground state’s Republican leadership, including the state’s Senate majority leader and House speaker, in an apparent extension of his efforts to persuade judges and election officials in the state to set aside Biden’s 154,000-vote margin of victory and grant the president the state’s electors.
It came amid mounting criticism that Trump’s efforts to subvert the results of the 2020 election could do long-lasting damage to democratic traditions.
Trump’s efforts extended to other states that Biden carried as well, amounting to an unprecedented attempt by a sitting president to maintain his grasp on power, or in failure, to delegitimise his opponent’s victory in the eyes of his army of supporters.
Rick Hasen, an election law expert and professor who has been meticulously chronicling the 2020 race, wrote that there would be “rioting” in the streets if an effort was made to set aside the vote in Michigan, calling it tantamount to an attempted coup.
“We should worry because this is profoundly antidemocratic and is delegitimising the victory of Joe Biden in a free and fair election,” Hasen wrote on his blog.
It is profoundly depressing we still have to discuss this. But it is extremely unlikely to lead to any different result for president.
In a joint statement after the White House meeting, Michigan Senate majority leader Mike Shirkey and House speaker Lee Chatfield said allegations of fraud should be investigated, but indicated they were unmoved by Trump’s claims thus far.
“We have not yet been made aware of any information that would change the outcome of the election in Michigan and as legislative leaders, we will follow the law and follow the normal process regarding Michigan’s electors, just as we have said throughout this election,” they said.
“The candidates who win the most votes win elections and Michigan’s electoral votes,” they added, saying they used the meeting with Trump to press him for more pandemic aid money for their state.
The president on Friday again falsely claimed victory, declaring as an aside during a White House announcement on drug pricing, “I won, by the way, but you know, we’ll find that out”.

Trump’s roughly hour-long meeting with the Michigan legislators came days after he personally called two local canvass board officials who had refused to certify the results in Wayne County, Michigan’s most populous county and one that overwhelmingly favoured Biden.
The two GOP officials eventually agreed to certify the results. But following the president’s call, they said they had second thoughts.
The Board of State Canvassers is to meet on Monday to certify the statewide outcome and it was unclear whether Republican members of that panel would similarly baulk.
White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters that the meeting with Michigan officials was “not an advocacy meeting” and insisted Trump “routinely meets with lawmakers from across the country”.
But such meetings are in fact rare, particularly as the president has maintained a low profile since the election.
Trump’s effort to set aside the Michigan vote was sure to fail. Experts on Michigan election law said the Michigan Board of State Canvassers’ authority was limited in scope.
“Their duties are to receive the canvass and certify the canvass, that’s it,” said John Pirich, a former assistant attorney general who teaches at Michigan State University Law School.
“They have absolutely no power to investigate allegations, theories or any half-brained kind of arguments that are being thrown around.”
The Michigan Legislature would be called on to select electors if Trump succeeded in persuading the board not to certify the results.
Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer could seek a court order forcing board members to certify the election and could remove those who refused, said Steve Liedel, another election attorney.

Trump’s play for Michigan was among a series of last-ditch tactics in battleground states that his team is using to challenge his defeat.
President-elect Joe Biden will take office on January 20th 2021
They also have suggested in a legal challenge that Pennsylvania set aside the popular vote there and pressured county officials in Arizona to delay certifying vote tallies.
There have been multiple lawsuits in battleground states that have failed so far to reverse any votes.
In two Democratic-leaning counties in Wisconsin that are recounting votes, Trump’s campaign sought to discard tens of thousands of absentee ballots that it alleged should not have been counted.
The objections were twice denied by the three-member Dane County Board of Canvassers on bipartisan votes.
Trump was expected to make the same objections in Milwaukee County ahead of a court challenge once the recount concludes.
The increasingly desperate and erratic moves by the president and his allies have no reasonable chance of changing the outcome of the 2020 election, in which Biden has now received more votes than any other presidential candidate in history and has clinched the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win.","It comes amid criticism that Trump’s efforts to subvert the results of the election could do long-lasting damage to democratic traditions.",32,0,0,133593,"Sat 9:21 AM"

At 9 o’clock in the morning, IRA assassination teams were moving into positions across the city, most of them in a small area of the south inner-city.
Reading the addresses today – Lower Baggot Street, Earlsfort Terrace, Upper Mount Street, Morehampton Road – it’s almost claustrophobic to imagine the killing zone that morning. But the Gresham, on the other side of the Liffey, was geographically removed from much of the action.
James Cahill, one of the IRA men dispatched to the hotel, later recounted “three groups, consisting of three men each, were detailed to carry out the shooting. The remainder of our party were given the tasks of controlling members of the hotel staff and residents, covering the exits and preventing communication with the outside during the operation.”
In Cahill’s recollections, they had been sent to the hotel to eliminate “three intelligence officers who were residing in the Gresham.”
Within minutes, two men were dead in the hotel. Cahill remembered entering the room of one of the targets, Captain Patrick Joseph MacCormack. Sitting up in bed, MacCormack fired a shot on the raiding party, “We fired almost in the same instant, killing him outright.”

In the hallway of the hotel, the IRA party encountered another man, who introduced himself as “Alan Wilde, British Intelligence Officer, just back from Spain.” He was shot, dying instantly.
The mystery of MacCormack and Wilde
In subsequent years, the families of MacCormack and Wilde were adamant their loved ones were not secret service agents. MacCormack was a qualified vet and respected athlete who had joined the Royal Army Veterinary Corps.
His mother, writing to Michael Collins and Richard Mulcahy later for answers, was informed that there was no particular charge against him except “that he was an enemy soldier.” 
Wilde proved more baffling still, and while he had a chequered British Army past, just what he was doing in Dublin is still unclear.
Three days before his death he had written to Arthur Henderson of the British Labour Party, telling him that as an eyewitness to what was happening in Ireland, “I must say first it is not British rule and second Ireland will not be coerced. Ireland is essentially a tradition-loving people and her traditions must be respected by those who govern her.”
Perhaps Wilde in his innocence felt he could solve the Irish problem; three days later, he was a fatality of it. The question remains, had he panicked on seeing the men in the corridor that day, presumed them police, and told them what he felt they wanted to hear?
A fateful and bloody morning
There are no such mysteries around most of the dead of the morning we now know as Bloody Sunday, and which the British press labelled Black Sunday. It marked a major escalation in an intelligence war which had been playing out on the streets of the capital for more than a year.
Through targeted assassination, The Squad – a team of IRA assassins which operated directly under the control of Michael Collins and his intelligence network – had neutralised the intelligence division of the Dublin Metropolitan Police throughout 1919.
But the men killed on the morning of Bloody Sunday were mostly of a different breed entirely, top-level intelligence agents who Collins felt had to be removed from the picture.

Reflecting on that need, Collins would insist that “my final goal was not to be reached merely by beating it [The British Secret Service] out of existence—I wanted to replace it with a better, and an Irish Secret Service. The way to do this was obvious, and it fell naturally into two main parts—making it unhealthy for Irishmen to betray their fellows, and making it deadly for Englishmen to exploit them.”
Collins maintained that the death of an intelligence agent was a hammer blow by comparison to the death of a soldier, as “even when the new spy stepped into the shoes of the old one, he could not step into the old man’s knowledge.”
The Twelve Apostles
The men Collins recruited into The Squad were primarily young volunteers, some still in their teens. Despite this, they were often already veterans of violence, as survivors of the 1916 Rising. There is a detached coldness in how some of them later spoke of their work; Vinnie Byrne telling the historian Tim Pat Coogan:
We were all young, twenty, twenty-one. We never thought we’d win or lose. We just wanted to have a go. We’d go out in pairs, walk up to the target and do it, then split….On a typical job we’d use about eight, including the back-up. Nobody got in our way. One of us would knock him over with the first shot, and the other would finish him off with a shot to the head.
The counter-intelligence war waged by Collins on the streets of Dublin had several facets. Charlie Dalton, just a teenager on the morning of Bloody Sunday, recounted that “we compiled a list of friendly persons in the public services, railways, mailboats and hotels. I was sent constantly to interview stewards, reporters, waiters and hotel porters to verify our reports of the movement of enemy agents.”
Perhaps the most important assist at their disposal was Lily Mernin, a typist in Dublin Castle, who had access to internal paperwork that was crucial in drawing up the Bloody Sunday hit list.
The Squad consisted of just a dozen hand-picked operatives, earning the moniker The Twelve Apostles. An operation like Bloody Sunday required more hands. The IRA’s Seán Russell, a 1916 veteran and later IRA Chief of Staff who sought military assistance from both Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany, was tasked with finding the additional men.
A Volunteer recounted the tensions the night before the operation, as Russell told them it was “vitally necessary for the success of our fight that they [the spies] be removed; that no country had scruples about shooting enemy spies in wartime; that if any man had moral scruples about going on this operation he was at full liberty to withdraw and no one would think any the worse of him; that he wanted every man to be satisfied in his conscience that he could properly take part in this operation.”

Some IRA men struggled with what they were being asked to do – Charles Dalton remembered sitting up the night before, and that “I was wrought up, thinking of what we had to do the next morning, and I could the other men were the same.”
But on the day itself, there was a sort of adrenaline that moved through them all. In the words of Frank Thornton, they knew they had been asked that day “to do something which was outside the ordinary scope of the soldier.”
The dead of the morning killings
Accounts of the IRA arriving at addresses that morning survive from both sides of the opening doors. Vinnie Byrne recalled arriving at 38 Upper Mount Street, where two suspected secret service agents were residing:
I ordered the British officer to get out of bed. He asked me what was going to happen and I replied: ‘Ah, nothing.’ I then ordered him to march in front of me… I marched my officer down to the back room where the other officer was.
He was standing up in the bed, facing the wall. I ordered mine to do likewise. When the two of them were together I thought to myself ‘The Lord have mercy on your souls! ’ I then opened fire with my Peter. They both fell dead.
At 117 Morehampton Road, Thomas Herbert Smith, the landlord, is shot by a raiding party. He is a forgotten and accidental civilian casualty of the morning. Smith’s wife later told the inquiry:
I saw some men coming up the stairs, who appeared to number about twenty, with revolvers in their hands. They then told me to put my hands up and my husband came out on the landing and asked for a little time to put on some clothes, which they granted. I then asked if I could go into my baby in the next room and they pushed me roughly into it. I then heard about eight shots.
In London, there was ultimately fury in the press at the events of that morning but little sympathy from the political class, Hamar Greenwood telling the King’s Private Secretary that “he was astonished at the carelessness of those who lost their lives yesterday morning – not one of them had a revolver, whereas he never goes to bed without a revolver by his side and always carries one on his person.” 
To Greenwood, the men had been out-soldiered, beaten at their own game. To a government which referred to the IRA only as the ‘murder gang’, and insisted it had ‘murder by the throat’, the events of that morning were proof that the IRA was a capable opponent not only in the rural terrain of guerilla warfare but in the populated urban environments too.
The drama of Bloody Sunday, in those chaotic morning minutes, was only beginning.

The previous year, when Ireland beat England at Lansdowne Road, there’d been a shock. “They came to Dublin expecting to walk over us and get all their players picked on the Lions,” Johns recalls. “But, instead, we battered them.”
Twelve months on, March 1994, Johns and his team of improbables were in Twickenham, trying to stay relevant, a challenge that would persist throughout the decade. Grim times led to a pre-game pact: if we are going to lose, then best go down swinging.
They’d one target in particular. Kyran Bracken, born in Skerries, had committed the cardinal sin of declaring for England. And now here he was, at Twickenham, red rose on his chest, ball high over his head, staring into the eyes of a couple of zealots.
“I was trying to unsettle him,” Johns remembers. “Mick (Galwey) had grabbed hold of him and had swung him around.  It was a line-out, Kyran had grabbed the tap down, his arms aloft. All I could see were his ribs. I went low to put in a tackle. But Mick had the same idea. He didn’t get Bracken but he certainly got my nose. I hit the deck. There was blood everywhere.”
Bracken wasn’t hanging around to offer sympathy. He took the ball from one end of the field to the next while Galwey and Johns examined the scene of the crime. “It’s busted,” Galwey said.
Welcome to Irish rugby in the 1990s. Someone, at some time, always had their nose out of joint.

Over a quarter of a century on Ireland are back at Twickenham, this time in the Autumn Nations Cup. The circumstances are different; the stands are empty, not filled with raucous, merry, drinkers, a consequence of the pandemic. Ireland’s opponents, multi-cultural, powerful, athletic, dominant, are remoulded. These days a poor man’s Mourinho coaches them, someone who isn’t afraid to stick the boot in metaphorically.
“I was thinking the other day about what Rassie Erasmus said, Ireland being soft, and honestly, I hardly think the players will be one bit bothered by that,” says Johns. “But what Eddie Jones said, ‘Ireland being the United Nations’, taunting (Andrew) Porter about his scrummaging; that’ll motivate them. Without question, England have hardened up in the last couple of years, Jones opting for players who are a lot more physical.
“People have said they’ve bullied Ireland in the last few matches. Well, there’s the motivation for us. It’d be lovely to see the Irish pack coming up with an answer to that.”
As yet another competition is added to rugby’s congested calendar, we will hear about the withering of tradition, but today’s match at Twickenham is a reminder that although the game has been transformed from a hobby into a business, something hasn’t been lost. When Ireland go to London, there is always hope, always possibility. There is proof: England lost that day in ‘94.
“No one gave us a chance,” Johns says.
Come and have a go if you think you are hard enough. Johns in 1997.

And with good reason. England had beaten New Zealand the previous autumn; Ireland had lost eight of Johns’ first 11 internationals.
He made his debut in 1990, aged 22. “I found out on the radio, listening to the sports bulletin, living in digs in Dublin at the time. ‘There is a place in the team for debutant Paddy Johns, from Ulster’. ‘Yesssssss’, I said. All you’d ever thought about, for the previous ten years or so, was about to happen.”
And then for two years nothing happened.
Twenty-two when he won his first cap, he was 24 when the second came along. Dunedin, 1992. Jim Staples scores one try, Vinny Cunningham two and is inches away from gathering an intercept and racing away for his hat-trick. New Zealand win 24-21, another near miss to add to a lengthy list.

There was Australia in ’96,  France in ’98 and ’99, Scotland just about every year. “Every defeat hurt,” Johns says. It was a feeling he had to get used to, 18 of his 20 caps ending in defeat in a two-year spell between January 1996 and November 1998.
“Do you know what it was like?” Johns says. “It was like Crystal Palace going up against Manchester City. We weren’t going to go to Paris and outplay France. We had to get stuck into them because we just weren’t as skilful. Often we weren’t as strong, either. Or as fit. In fact, we just wouldn’t have had the depth,” Johns adds.
“We’d have had 12 or 13 really solid players, but we probably had chinks which good, opposing teams exploited. Teams weren’t stupid. They could pick out a weakness and exploit it. International rugby comes down to fine margins. The days we’d 15 good men out, we did well then. But if we were missing a centre, an outside back, we just didn’t have the cover. It’s not like now, where the depth chart in Irish rugby is impressive. Things were different. They’ve evolved.”
But before the evolution there was revolution. After all those defeats, Johns’ days ended in relative glory, victories chalked up in five of his last six Ireland appearances, coinciding with the arrival on the scene of a kid from Clontarf.
“(Brian) O’Driscoll is the greatest all round player we have ever had,” Johns says. “Almost every trophy we won in those years he played, the Triple Crowns, the ‘o9 Grand Slam, the 2014 Six Nations, it almost always came down to him; a 20-yard burst, a tackle. Think about his two-yard dive over the line against England in ’09. Ireland won that game by a point. He influenced so many big games.
Johns compared O'Driscoll's impact in Paris to Lomu's at the '95 World Cup.

“I only knew him as a young fella but as soon as he came on the scene, we knew he was special. He was humble, unassuming. He lit up the Stade de France with that hat-trick in 2000. For Irish rugby, that arrival was like Jonah Lomu bursting onto the scene at the ’95 World Cup.”
Part of him wonders about the games that got away, the 24-21 loss in ‘92 against New Zealand, the France defeats towards the end of the decade, the Australia one in the middle of it. What would have happened if fate had have been kinder, had Johns – a shining light in a dark decade – been born a little later or O’Driscoll a bit sooner?   
“Look, had he been around, we’d have won more, no question,” Johns says, “because the man was class, absolute class. But you play in the time you are allotted and you give your best. I’m glad I got to experience both worlds. I loved being a professional, the training, the regime, but the amateur days were also special. Some of the stories from nights out.”
Life was simpler. “It was not your job; you could let your hair down,” he says. “These days, the players are on the bus and heading up the road an hour after the final whistle. When we played interpros, we stayed the night in Limerick, Galway or Dublin, had a laugh, drank the pints, got to know the guys on the other team. We trained hard, too. It was not a busman’s holiday when we went abroad. But it was fun.”
It remained fun when rugby went professional, Johns packing in his dentistry job to get his teeth stuck into the task Saracens set him. “We all had a choice — it was either do this or be left behind. I was half-way through my international career. I loved it. I didn’t want it to end.”
**
Back in Twickenham, 19 February 1994, 77 minutes on the stadium clock, he did want the end. Ireland were hanging on, 13-12 ahead, with a put-in deep inside their own half. The shove went in. No movement. Seconds passed. Still nothing. “Just keep it in there Paddy,” Michael Bradley, the scrum half said to his No8.
If anything sums up Irish rugby’s mentality back then, that was it. There wasn’t trust in the backline to see the game out. Understandable, too. They scored a grand total of three tries in the ’93 and ’94 championships. Ambition was a dirty word.
These days it’s not but even so Ireland go into today’s game with question marks hanging over them, Erasmus suggesting they are ‘soft’; Jones asking if they have the ability to bring a ‘dominant’ display to Twickenham.
“We had similar questions asked of us way back then,” says Johns.

403,212,"'Eddie Jones is just playing games' - Ireland aim to walk the walk in Twickenham",https://www.the42.ie/ireland-england-preview-2-5273494-Nov2020/,"WHILE EDDIE JONES has thrown a few of his usual “little bombshells” their way this week, Ireland are intent on doing their talking on the pitch today at Twickenham.
Walking the walk against England certainly feels well overdue for Ireland, who have been damaged by their defeats on the last three occasions the sides have met.
With head coach Andy Farrell having picked a rather different-looking Ireland XV that is missing injured captain and out-half Johnny Sexton, this feels like a very important occasion for this squad, even if the Autumn Nations Cup itself means very little. 
Jones’ mischief mainly focused on Ireland being “the United Nations” due to five players in the starting XV having qualified on residency grounds but Ireland haven’t been sidetracked.
“He seems to like to throw a few little bombshells over the wall,” said assistant coach Richie Murphy after yesterday’s captain’s run at Twickenham, led by 24-year-old James Ryan for the first time.
“We don’t focus on any of that. We know what we need to control and what we can control. We’ll just move on with that.”
Perhaps Farrell will harness Jones’ jibe as an extra little hit of motivation for his players, not that they should need it.
Humiliation is a very strong word but there’s no doubting that England have dominated this fixture for the last two years, with Ireland’s Grand Slam-clinching win in London in 2018 seeming like a very long time ago. Pulling off a victory today would be a massive momentum boost for the Farrell era, which is still only six games old.
England are clear and deserved favourites. World Cup finalists last year, Jones’s side sealed their the Six Nations title recently and have a team bristling with physical power, experience, and tactical acumen.

It is likely to be a brutal affair for those at the coalface, with the scrum sure to be a key battleground. Jones looked to land an early blow in that regard by questioning the legality of Ireland tighthead Andrew Porter’s scrummaging.
“I think Eddie Jones is just playing games in that situation,” said Murphy.
“He obviously thinks Porter is a very good player, which he is. No one has ever come to us and made any comments about Ports’ scrum technique.
“So, we have no issues. We have had no feedback from World Rugby in relation to what he does. It’s just one of those games.”
Ireland will hope that Pascal Gaüzère – who awarded seven scrum penalties to Saracens against Leinster in September – doesn’t come into this one with any pre-conceived notions, with Sarries loosehead Mako Vunipola and hooker Jamie George starting against the all-Leinster front row of Cian Healy, Ronan Kelleher, and Porter.
With Joe Launchbury adding a bit more heft in the England second row, they will be aiming to do real damage at scrum time, even if Ireland will feel Connacht man Quinn Roux provides a bit of stability behind Porter.
The set-piece has gone decisively in England’s favour in these sides’ last few meetings, with Farrell retaining Peter O’Mahony in his back row to aid captain Ryan in that area.
The pair of them worked together superbly last time out against Wales, although Maro Itoje and co. will intend to slow and stop the Irish supply line.
Ireland’s maul hasn’t fired in recent times and simply must be better today, while their management of the kicking game will also be vital as the fresh halfback pairing of Jamison Gibson-Park, who starts ahead of Conor Murray, and Ross Byrne look to steer the ship. It’s another area England have been far better than them, with Ben Youngs and Owen Farrell both astute with the boot, as well as centre Henry Slade and fullback Elliot Daly.
“England will come with a big kicking game and a lot of pressure, trying to put the ball back in behind you,” said Murphy.

“It’s making sure that we’re on top of that, making sure we can deal with the stuff coming into our backfield will be important and how we get out of our end.”
“Field position is going to be massively important and when we get the chance to fire the shots we need to take them and not go into our shell.”
There were promising signs from Ireland’s set-piece attack last time out against Wales, but England’s smothering defensive strength should make their lives much more difficult today.

Both teams have different-looking midfield pairings for this clash, with Slade partnering Ollie Lawrence on what is the Worcester man’s third cap for England, as Bundee Aki and Munster’s Chris Farrell team up for Ireland.
“Bundee and Chris are big, strong men – very physical but also with the ability to play the ball to the outside,” said Murphy.
“Trying to use their strengths, which is their ball carrying, is going to be very important.”
Aki and Farrell will likely be prominent figures if Ireland can get into their attacking flow, but a ferocious contest for possession at the breakdown awaits. The likes of CJ Stander, Porter, Caelan Doris, O’Mahony, Kelleher and Aki will be at the forefront of Ireland’s charge for turnovers, while the English have major defensive weapons of their own in Itoje, the chop-tackling Sam Underhill, and Tom Curry.
Jones has retained Jonathan Joseph on the right wing in a roaming role that will see him pop up all over the pitch, while Jonny May is a lethal finisher and a very rounded player at the same time.
Of course, Ireland have their own shiny new back-three weapon in the form of James Lowe, who will be looking to add to his debut try against Wales as the experienced Keith Earls returns on the right wing and Hugo Keenan gets his second start at fullback.

Leading the way for Ireland will be Ryan, whose first time being named captain at this level comes in the toughest place of all.
“Over the last year, he’s taken a massive stride forward,” said Murphy. “He’s very comfortable in his own skin. He’s obviously a massive presence physically and when he speaks, he speaks really well.
“So I think at 24, he’s quite young but he shows all the characteristics of being a really good leader. I think all the boys are happy to see him lead them out and they are there to help him.”

“I mean, you look at the traffic and you look at what’s going on and workplaces. People will tell you stories about car parks are full; canteens are full in workplace settings. So people are really not listening to this message and they’re meeting up unnecessarily,” he said.
“It’s absolutely clearly understood that not everybody is in a workplace situation where they can work from home. But clearly many, many people who are in situations where they can work from home are choosing not to do so and coming into the workplace and meeting up and having engagements that are leading to transmission opportunities.”
Deputy CMO Dr Ronan Glynn acknowledged that there are “two parts to the story” when it comes to attendance at work.
“There’s the employees, but there’s also the employers. And employers have a significant responsibility to take these messages on board as well and to encourage and facilitate employees insofar as is possible to work from home at the moment.”
A number of workers who spoke to TheJournal.ie said their roles could be fulfilled from home – and some were done remotely during the first lockdown – but they have been required to attend their workplaces during the current round of Level 5 restrictions. 
One woman who works for a law firm said infrastructure was put in place during the first lockdown to facilitate all staff working remotely.
However, staff have been required to attend the office since the summer. Legal services are deemed essential under the government’s guidelines and many workers in this sector are being told to come to work, even if their jobs could technically be done remotely.
“My employer doesn’t believe that anyone’s work can be done effectively from home and has therefore said that our physical presence is required in the office,” the woman said.
“The reality is that staff here absolutely could work from home. We can’t get trials on for hearing in the courts and meetings which would ordinarily have been in person are now conducted via video or conference call. We now all spend all day, every day sitting in front of computer screens or on the phone. Of course we could do this at home.”
She said colleagues are “too fearful” to raise the issue with their employer.
“I cannot express how incredibly frustrating it was to hear Dr Tony Holohan say that people are recklessly ‘choosing’ not to work from home because ‘the message hasn’t got through’,” she said.
I have done all I can in my own personal life to abide by all the restrictions that have been put in place. I hear the message about working from home but as an employee I am powerless to heed it without my employer’s support.
“Any public opprobrium for ‘full carparks and work canteens’ should be directed at employers who are refusing to allow their employees to work from home, not at employees who are frightened of losing their jobs.”
The Law Society said it is up to individual law firms to decide when they should open, basing their decision on the nature of work they do, how they do it, and the logistics of the workplace they operate within.
“The courts, also designated by government as an ‘essential service’, have remained open for urgent business,” it said. “Solicitors must attend the courts to provide access to justice for their clients, while complying with the same social distancing rules required of everyone everywhere.”
The society said it has issued guidelines to solicitors to help them to adjust to remote working, including advice on risk assessments, internal communication, accommodating vulnerable staff, reorganising workplaces and accommodating clients.
Employment law experts have said workers in the majority of cases do not have a contractual right to work remotely if their employer wants them on site.
In some sectors, there may be logistical barriers such as GDPR that prevent them from allowing at-home working. In other cases, employers may believe their workforce is less productive at home and require them to come into their workplace, despite the government advice. 
One public sector worker who is in an administrative role said some people in her team are allowed to work part of their week at home, but she has been told her role requires her to be onsite.
“My manager has refused my request to work from home even though I rely on an overcrowded bus line to come to work every day,” she said.
The woman said she has a work laptop with a virtual private network on which she has done work from her home on previous occasions, when required. She said she has to take it home with her in case she is identified as a close contact of a confirmed case – if this were to happen she would be allowed to work from home during her self-isolation period.
The woman said she was hoping to be allowed to work at her family’s home, which is in a different county, over the Christmas period but has been told she cannot do this either.
It is incredibly upsetting as I haven’t seen my family since March because of Covid but want to spend Christmas with them, and I’m having to beg for extra leave those days so I can travel back to see them – otherwise I’ll have spent the last seven months virtually alone.
An employee who works in a large retailer’s head office said his company is “selecting various workers individually and demanding they come into the office because they’re not being efficient enough at home”.
He said these workers are being told they are “essential to the business”.
“They’re saying that people have to come into the office to work the phones, but we don’t take orders over the phones and I’ve worked in businesses before where phones can be redirected to someone’s land line or mobile,” he said. “Everything else is just done via our work laptops that are given to us anyway.”

He said he made a complaint to the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) but was told that it is up to an employer to determine which roles are required to be done in the workplace.
“I get that the current government wants to give businesses slack but it’s even more a slap in the face than usual when they’re calling this a choice.”
Speaking to the Oireactas Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment this week, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said there are “lots of different reasons” why there are more people going to work now than there were back in March and April.
“First of all there is a wider definition of essential work, we’re now including construction, manufacturing, international trade in services, supply chain, there’s a lot more – hundreds, thousands more people – deemed essential,” he said.
“Childcare as well, education, things that were always essential in our minds but weren’t deemed essential back in March and April that are.
“So that’s the main reason, I think, why there are more people going to work now and the traffic count counts are higher now than they would have been back in the spring.”
He said there are also people who do want to get back into their offices.
“I have heard from employers even in the public service of people being allowed back to the office for mental health reasons, because they were suffering at home for reasons around their own mental health or even issues around relationships, or being in overcrowded housing accommodation.
“So there may be lots of different reasons why people are back at work, and I don’t think the main reason is employers pressurising people to come to work when they could work from home.”
Varadkar said this is “not to say it does not happen” and he has heard examples of it himself.
“There are people who could work from home and perhaps feel they’re being pressurised into coming into the workplace when that’s unnecessary, I’ve come across some examples myself or people have contacted me about them.
“And what we’ve done to date is to point them in the direction of the WRC and that’s the appropriate body really that can deal with complaints from people who believe they can work from home who are being told that they have to come in when perhaps they don’t.”","This week the Tánaiste said the main reason more people are attending work now is the wider definition of essential work.",10,0,1,35226,"Sat 6:45 AM"
405,182,"'We can't judge anyone for whatever decision they make': Irish emigrants on why they're travelling home this Christmas",https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-people-coming-home-for-christmas-5270127-Nov2020/,"MANY IRISH PEOPLE living abroad are unsure of whether or not to come home for Christmas given the Covid-19 restrictions in place.
Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan recently said coming home for Christmas would not be deemed “essential” travel.
Holohan last week said many other countries are “in a deteriorating situation” in terms of the virus.
“If we make the progress that we hope we can continue to make and find ourselves at the beginning of December with a much improved situation, even from where we are at the moment, one of the biggest risks will be the importation of disease through international travel.”
Also speaking last week, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said it was “too soon” for people to book flights home.
“We’re not in a position at this point to advise people that it’s safe to come home for Christmas. And I know that’s a tough message to hear but that is the case at the moment,” he said.
Many Irish people had already booked their flights home at that stage – some are unsure of what to do, but others have decided to stick to their plans and come home.
There has been mixed messaging over what people should and shouldn’t do in terms of foreign travel.
Mandatory quarantine is not in force in Ireland. Nor is it a legal requirement for a person to restrict their movements for 14 days after their arrival from another country, but as one of the key measures for stopping the spread of Covid-19 it is very strongly advised.
Speaking on Wednesday, Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said if people do need to come home from Europe for Christmas, “there is a clear traffic light system in place with protocols you need to follow”.
“I think that is a pretty common sense approach,” he told Newstalk.
From midnight on 29 November, travellers arriving into Ireland from so-called ‘red’ regions in the new traffic light system will be advised that they no longer need to restrict their movements once they pass a Covid-19 PCR test (usually a nasal swab) five days following their arrival here.
Travellers arriving from orange regions do not have to restrict their movements if they carry the results of a negative Covid-19 test taken at least three days before their arrival.
Those who do not have a negative test upon arrival in Ireland can have a test taken five days after their arrival. Passengers will be asked to restrict their movements until they get the test.
Impact on mental health
Liadh Casey works as a psychologist in Edinburgh. The 25-year-old said people’s mental health needs to be taken into consideration during any conversation about what is and isn’t viewed as essential travel.
Liadh plans to come home to Cork next month so she can spend Christmas with her family.
She originally moved to Edinburgh in 2017 to do a masters degree in psychology and now works in a centre that helps young people living with mental health issues.
Liadh said if people flying from Dublin to London and vice versa for work is seen as essential travel, flying home should be too.
“Personally, working in mental health, I think this is probably the most essential travel you’ll make all year.
“There will be a bigger impact on people who can’t see their families for Christmas if they can’t come home, than I think Leo Varadkar and Tony Holohan are even considering.
“Christmas is a very lonely time for a lot of people, it’s not a nice time for a lot of people, and the only way to get through that is through the support of your family,” Liadh told TheJournal.ie.
Her father died a few years ago and, as is the case for many families, Christmas is particularly difficult after a bereavement.
“To be honest, I didn’t ever consider not coming home. Christmas is a weird time for us anyway, so I just wouldn’t have done it to my mum and siblings. You definitely need to be with your family.
“Even if it was the case where I had to take a month or whatever off, I was always going to come home.”
Liadh is a key worker so can get tested for Covid-19 before she comes home to make sure she is virus-free, and will restrict her movements in Ireland.
She has been working from home during the pandemic so she is not meeting many people, and her office closes for two weeks over Christmas.
“A lot of my stuff is based at home – online meetings with clinical psychologists, schools, things like that, so it’s all on Zoom anyway.
“I was humming and hawing but then I was thought there was no point of me being here when I’m not even going to be working, it’s not like I’m taking time off.”
‘We’ll get home somehow’
Liadh said all her closest friends in Scotland are also returning to Ireland for Christmas. She booked her flights earlier this month and plans to stay for about three weeks.
Liadh knows of at least four people whose flights have been changed to date.
“I hope that mine are not going to change, but I don’t know if that’s being a bit naive. There is talk of us driving of one of us driving and getting the ferry from Glasgow to Belfast and then driving down, but it’s a good 18 hours. We’ll get home somehow.
“If my flights do go ahead, I’ll get tested before I go, be very careful in the airport and isolate for a week.

Health Minister: 'If you do need to travel home for Christmas - follow traffic light rules'
“Then I won’t be stupid, I won’t be going out, but at least I’ll be able to have Christmas dinner at the other side of the table, rather than in a different room to my family.”
‘Incredibly guilty’
Ciarán from Dublin is currently living in London. He also intends to come home for Christmas, and would consider getting the ferry if his flight is cancelled.
“I have some friends who are getting the ferry home, they’re not even bothering trying flights, they’re going straight for the ferry in first week of December.
“I don’t think my flight is going to be cancelled. I had the fear for a little while that it might, but I don’t think it’s going to happen.”
The 31-year-old moved to England just over a year ago – before anyone had heard of the term Covid-19.
“I came back over to London after Christmas and then the pandemic struck in March. I ended up going home in March thinking I was going home for maybe a long weekend, but ended up staying home for a couple of months.”
Ciarán can also work remotely and has been in his office just once since March. He booked his flight home for Christmas in early September.
“I thought everything would be fine, but then in the last couple of weeks obviously there has been messaging that is making me feel incredibly guilty for having booked my flights home.
“I’m still going to come home because the messaging has been so incredibly mixed. They’re putting all these measures in place to allow people to come home, but then also saying ‘don’t come home’, it’s quite confusing.”
As he can work remotely, Ciarán hasn’t booked a return flight yet but plans to stay for about a month. He said he will likely get a PCR test so he only needs to restrict his movements for a few days. If he can’t do this, he plans to quarantine for two weeks.
“I wasn’t planning on coming home and running rampant around the place.
“I’m staying within the guidelines in terms of keeping myself safe and quarantining and doing all the things that you’re recommended to do. So as long as people do that, I don’t know what else we can do really.”
Ciarán plans to fly home in the coming days to avoid any pre-Christmas rush. He said telling people it’s “too soon” to book flights doesn’t make sense as it could lead to a larger number of people travelling home closer to Christmas, making airports and planes more crowded.
“If we keep asking people to postpone coming home, everyone’s going to be in a rush to come home at the same time, and that’s when there might be issues, when there might be busy airports.
“I very consciously decided to come home early so that I could miss the rush and quarantine for enough time and that I would be able to spend the majority of December with my family.”
Ciarán said if he can’t fly home, he’s worried about the impact this would have on his mental health.
“I haven’t even properly considered having to stay here really and how that would impact me in terms of my mental health – when I say I haven’t considered it, it’s because I don’t want to consider it.”

‘A privileged comment’
Kate Smith (31) is originally from Dublin but has lived in Vancouver in Canada for years. She plans to fly home early next month and stay for four weeks, quarantining for the first two.
Kate said she considered getting a PCR test but the cost of the test, close to €200, is the “number one barrier” so she will quarantine instead.
She has also been working remotely during the pandemic and can work from Ireland.
Kate Smith
“My parents want me to come home. I’m going to be isolating within the family home, but I’ll be in a separate room with my own bathroom so they don’t mind that at all,” she told us.
“My brother just recently has a baby with his wife in September. That’s the first grandchild in the family so it’s a big deal, that’s my main push to get home.”
Kate’s flights have already been changed twice but she’s hopeful they won’t be cancelled.
“I do expect there to probably be some more movement, but the fact that I’m going for four weeks and that I’m quite flexible, being able to work remotely, I’m not too worried about that.”
Kate said she understands why the government is telling people to only travel if they have to, but said urging them to postpone booking flights isn’t fair – particularly for those who live further afield.
I totally get where they’re coming from, it’s a pandemic, but the one thing that irked me a bit about Leo’s comments, and the attitude of ‘don’t book yet’ is that it’s a bit privileged in my eyes because especially in long-haul travel you need to book months in advance in order for your normal person to be able to afford it.
“So, encouraging people to wait until, what, two weeks beforehand in December is just not practical for the majority of people when it comes to cost.
“Instead of discouraging travel, I think (the government) should be encouraging safe and responsible travel.”
Kate knows several Irish people who are coming from Canada for Christmas, as well as others who are staying put.
She said some people are of the view that it’s “really irresponsible” for people to travel home, but individuals have many different reasons for needing to travel or be with their families.
“I keep saying to people here, people who are struggling with the decision, that we can’t judge anyone else for whatever decision they make.
“Everyone’s mental health is different in this pandemic and you need to do whatever is is right for you, so I don’t think one person can say something as essential for another person.”","Many people are unsure of what to do and critical of mixed mesages from the government.",11,0,1,74063,"Sat 12:05 AM"

The minister confirmed that the former Attorney General’s name was the only one she put forward to the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Green Party leader for approval in the summer, only three weeks after being appointed as minister.
McEntee said she examined the suitability of three sitting judges who had expressed interest in filling the vacant Supreme Court seat, but had decided that Woulfe best suited the role.
“The inference here is that because I was three weeks in that I was not capable of doing that job and I don’t think that’s fair,” the minister told RTÉ.
McEntee continues to face scrutiny around the process that led to the appointment of  Justice Woulfe and has agreed to answer Dáil questions on the issue.
However, Opposition parties have criticised her proposal to address the matter during a late night rearranged session of ministerial questions – a format that would require questions to be submitted in advance and a limit placed on the number of TDs that could contribute.
Woulfe has become the focus of controversy since his attendance at the ‘golf-gate’ event in Clifden, Co Galway in August when members of the Oireachtas’s golf society gathering for a dinner organised in variance with Covid rules.
He refused to resign over his handling of the incident despite a call from Chief Justice Frank Clarke to quit.
While that furore continues, focus has also centred on McEntee amid questions on whether she should have told the leaders of the three coalition parties the names of the all those in the running for the vacant judicial seat.
The minister has insisted all her actions were completely in line with appropriate procedures.

Woulfe’s name was proposed to the minister by the independent Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, which assessed him as being suitable for the job, while the three sitting judges registered their expressions of interest through the attorney general’s office.
McEntee said she had been involved in six judicial appointment processes since becoming minister and on some of those occasions she recommended one name to Taoiseach Micheál Martin, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan and on others she had proposed a number of suitable candidates.
“In this instance I gave forward the name I recommended that I thought was the best person for the job and I need to be clear on that, I looked at all of the names – this is not someone who was randomly selected by me,” she said.
The minister said she took a “number of weeks” to examine all of the potential candidates in the frame.","The minister confirmed this evening that the former Attorney General’s name was the only one she put forward",10,0,0,37379,"Fri 10:37 PM"

RTÉ NEWS PRESENTERS David McCullagh and Eileen Dunne have apologised for their presence at a gathering in Montrose last week where social distancing was not fully observed.
The newsreaders were among a number of presenters, also including Bryan Dobson and Miriam O’Callaghan, who gathered for the final day of work for a long-time employee.
A report on what happened featured on the front page of The Irish Sun newspaper this morning, and McCullagh and others issued apologies through RTÉ earlier today.
McCullagh apologised for a second time at the start of this evening’s Six One bulletin.
“I am unfortunately one of the people who failed to properly observe social distancing here in RTÉ last week,” he said.
“It is an error of judgement I deeply regret, for which I take full responsibility and for which I unreservedly apologise to you our audience.
“None of us can afford to let down our guard, even for a moment, and I am very, very sorry that I failed to do the right thing on this occasion.”
Dunne also issued an apology at the start of this evening’s Nine O’Clock news.
“As you’ve seen, I too was photograph at the farewell for Phil, and I’d like to take this opportunity to apologise for my lack of judgement, particularly to RTÉ colleagues who’ve worked so hard to keep this campus Covid free over the past eight months,” she said.
“I’ve let you all down, and I’m sorry.”

Taoiseach Micheál Martin said he found the revelations “disappointing”, describing the event as “not helpful”.
“I think it’s a reminder to us all, in terms of our individual and collective behaviour,” he told Virgin Media.
“Covid and the suppression of Covid really boils down to our own individual behaviours. And I think we all have to behave as if we have Covid and that we could spread it if we engage with someone…
“I think people have apologised, and we’ll all learn from that again.”

He added that the situation would give a sense of normality that ran counter to public health messages, and called on people to avoid behaving similarly.
RTÉ said in a statement earlier that the event was a “short impromptu gathering in a public area” and that “a small number of RTÉ personnel working” attended.
RTÉ News has reported on the event, including on the Six One just before McCullagh’s apology, and has also published some of the photographs of the event on its website.

The former Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection urged the government to change its strategy because the current response is asking “an awful lot” of the Irish public.
Speaking on RTÉ radio this evening, Doherty claimed that people are now frustrated because case numbers are no longer falling after four weeks of Level 5 restrictions.
“Rolling lockdown is not working, and I don’t just mean in the numbers; I mean in the psyche and in the co-operation of Irish people,” she said. “They’re frustrated by it.”
The Fine Gael senator echoed comments made by her party colleague Eoghan Murphy, who said yesterday that a change in government policy would not be an admission that policies used so far are wrong.
Doherty called for a strategy that did not involve continuous lockdowns, saying that Ireland needed a “common purpose” that would allow people to socialise and for businesses to remain open while also protecting vulnerable people.
And although she acknowledged that decisions so far have been made in the public interest, she criticised the government for what she said was an apparent lack of alternative.
“I think it’s quite obvious that we don’t have a plan B. We need to get a plan B,” she said. 
“I think we understand that there is an acceptable level and an unacceptable level.
“But where you have understandable lapses from individuals at the moment, and unfortunately the finger-pointing and the shaming of people, is because we’re being asked an awful lot. And the awful lot doesn’t seem to be producing the results.”
Doherty’s comments follow remarks by Taoiseach Micheál Martin that exiting the current restrictions and preparing for Christmas will be “very challenging for all”.

But public health chiefs have warned that the progress in bringing down levels of the virus made during lockdown has stalled and say the next two weeks will be critical.
Doherty’s party colleague and Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe also warned that the country needs to look “beyond Christmas” ahead of a decision on lifting pandemic restrictions next week.
“We do need to look beyond Christmas itself. And be aware that the medium-term goal in advance of a vaccine being broadly available is to get the spread of the disease down to the lowest level possible,” he said.
“Christmas is so important from a family point of view, from a wellbeing point of view, and for some from a worship point of view. So I recoil from saying that we’re in some way caught up with it.
“But if you talk to somebody who’s running a business, somebody’s who’s running a restaurant and is thinking of reopening it, they do want certainty beyond the 25 December.”

New Zealand natives Jamison Gibson-Park, Bundee Aki, and James Lowe, as well as South Africa natives Quinn Roux and CJ Stander, start for Ireland tomorrow against England in the Autumn Nations Cup.
Ireland assistant coach Richie Murphy said there is no feeling within the Irish camp that they need to defend themselves after Jones’ mischievous comment.
“No, definitely not,” said Murphy today. “We have a group of players who are obviously all eligible to play for Ireland, we select that squad early on in relation to who we feel is in the best place to play for Ireland over the next number of weeks.
“To tell you the truth, we think of all our players as being Irish. They’ve been in the country, they’re members of their local communities and we just get on with it from there.
“When the guys come in and play for Ireland they’re in a situation where they’re more than happy to do that and they take on the challenge as if they were anyone else.
“I can’t say how they actually feel but from a coaching point of view, from a group point of view, these guys come in, they fit into the group really well and they’re taking us forward.
“They’re adding to the environment, they’re questioning, they’re giving opinions and they’re working with the other guys.

“There’s no ‘us and them’, it’s Ireland as a team, as a squad, including the management.”
Murphy was speaking after Ireland’s captain’s run led by new skipper James Ryan at a wet Twickenham.
With Johnny Sexton out injured, 25-year-old Ross Byrne will make just his second Test start at out-half tomorrow and Murphy is backing him to impress.
“I’m very confident in Ross,” said Murphy. “He’s getting a big opportunity, obviously coming out of Johnny’s shadow like he does for Leinster is tough because people will be very focused on him.
“But he has led the week very well, he has stepped up, his communication with the guys around him, his leadership and his work with James Ryan and the other boys, has been really good.
“He’s going into a Test match that he knows is a massive opportunity for him personally but I know that Ross will put the team first and try to guide them in the right direction.”

The family of Sam Pegram (25) who died on an Ethiopian Airlines flight in 2019, talk about their distress over what they’ve gone through.
(BBC, approx 17 mins reading time)
The premature end to Sam’s life and that of 156 others could have been avoided. The Boeing 737 Max aircraft they were travelling on had fatal design flaws – and it was not the first to be involved in such a tragedy.  A near-identical 737 Max had crashed off Indonesia five months earlier, in chillingly similar circumstances. But tragically, after that crash, the aircraft was not grounded.

Speaking to Virgin Media News, Martin said that the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines could get authorization from EU and US regulatory authorities in the second half of December.
He said that this wouldn’t mean it would be ready in time for Christmas, but that it could be a “wonderful Christmas present, as in, a voucher for the next 12 months”. 
The Taoiseach said a high-level taskforce would need to be established to “go through the logistics” of rolling out the vaccine to people, adding that a 70% take-up was needed to achieve herd immunity.
Martin, who is a former health minister, said that there will be a “strong” public information campaign around the vaccine, and pointed out that vaccines have proved to be an important public health measure down through history in eliminating viruses. 
Everything we have been doing has been worth it. Everything we’ve been doing in terms of the personal sacrifices, and it’s been very hard for people.
“The vaccines gives us hope. And also it enables us to say, ‘let’s double down’. Let’s just not lose pace in the final ten minutes of this and give it everything we have to keep the virus under pressure.”

When asked would people be allowed to travel and meet with their families for Christmas, Martin said that he didn’t want to preempt a government decision, and would want to see the number of Covid-19 cases at the end of the month. 
When asked about when people will travel abroad for Christmas, Micheál Martin said that many people have decided not to fly home for Christmas, but that a decision will be made at the end of the month.

Testifying at the suspect’s trial, Alek Skarlatos said that he yanked a gun from the attacker’s hand, turned it on him and pulled the trigger.
However, the gun did not fire.
Skarlatos said: “I was honestly trying my best to kill or restrain him.”
Ayoub El Khazzani, the attack suspect, faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if he is convicted of attempted terrorist murder. The 31-year-old Moroccan is being tried with three suspected accomplices.
The testimonies this week from passengers who disarmed the attacker on the train from Amsterdam have highlighted the split-second decisions that foiled what could have become a mass slaughter.
The passengers’ heroics on 21 August 2015 inspired Clint Eastwood to direct a Hollywood movie re-enacting the dramatic events, called ‘The 15:17 To Paris’.
Skarlatos and two friends, who he grew up with in California, were on holiday at the time.

Trial begins over French train attack foiled by 'brave intervention' of three American tourists
One friend, Spencer Stone, pinned down the attacker in a stranglehold. Skarlatos moved in too, joined by another passenger once the gunman was on the ground.
Skarlatos said the gunman was “surprisingly difficult to control”.
With the attacker subdued, the train rerouted to Arras in northern France where El Khazzani was arrested.
Authorities say El Khazzani boarded the train in Brussels armed with the Kalashnikov, nine clips with 30 rounds each, an automatic pistol and a cutter.
Once aboard the train, El Khazzani lingered in a restroom between cars, where two other passengers confronted him, and then emerged bare-chested with his weapons.

221+ wrote to the Health Minister today to end the discussion, saying that they were “frustrated” with the response they received from the government, calling the last three weeks “pointless”.
“Four and a half months into its term we are forced to conclude that this Government, which could finally have done the right thing on this issue is in fact speaking out of both sides of its mouth,” said the group in a letter to Minister Donnelly.
CervicalCheck campaigner, Vicky Phelan, had previously expressed anger at the process surrounding the tribunal’s creation, with women impacted by the scandal not given an opportunity to weigh in on the decision.
The group, which was set up in 2018, sought to have the tribunal changed to reflect the new legal context after judicial decisions were reached in both the Ruth Morrissey and Patricia Carrick cases.
“We didn’t just point out the problems, we also proposed solutions. We acknowledge that some of those solutions were not possible at the stroke of a pen but they are entirely possible if those in Government had the will to act with the interests and needs of this group of victims at heart. They clearly don’t,” said the group in a statement.
We see no point in continuing this process. This Government had the opportunity to oversee a solution for these women that is better than the long fight through the courts. It chose otherwise and that will be its legacy when the debacle of the past could now be consigned to the archives.
The group had previously said that they had no confidence in the proposed tribunal and the group is now solely focused on supporting the women and families impacted by CervicalCheck.
In a statement, a spokesperson for the Minister said his priority was to facilitate the “least onerous process” for the women and families affected by the CervicalCheck controversy.

The spokesperson pointed to recommendations by Mr Justice Charles Meenan that a tribunal was “more compassionate” to legal proceedings in the High Court, saying it offered a “better route for women and families to progress their legal actions”.

ANYONE WHO SHARES intimate images of a person without their consent “will face serious criminal sanctions”, the justice minister has said.
Helen McEntee said the recent leak of tens of thousands of intimate images of females has caused “much upset and anger“, adding: “I share that anger.”
The minister said she is “determined to act and to introduce tough new laws”.
TheJournal.ie yesterday confirmed that gardaí are investigating the uploading of images and videos of Irish women and girls, without their consent, to a number of online forums.
It is understood that some of the images and videos are of minors.
McEntee said she will bring measures to Cabinet that will make it a criminal offence to share intimate images without consent.
“This is not just about revenge porn – sharing such images will become a criminal offence, regardless of the motivation of the person who passes them on.
“It will also be irrelevant if consent is given for an intimate image to be taken – I will ensure they can never be shared, even if consent was given for the image to be taken.”
The sharing of intimate or explicit images of a person without their consent is typically referred to as ‘revenge porn’, or image-based sexual abuse, and is usually done by an ex-partner. It is not currently an offence in Ireland.
Over 50,000 people have to date signed a petition calling for this type of abuse to be made a criminal offence.
Any images of, or depicting, a person under the age of 18 engaging in sexual activity is considered child sexual abuse material under the 1998 Child Trafficking and Pornography Act.
In a statement released this evening, An Garda Síochána said that if you have been the victim of harassment, to get in touch with Gardaí. 
The statement said that “some of the comments circulating on social media are not factual, and we wish to reassure the public An Garda Síochána is working quickly to establish the factual aspect of the matters alleged”.
We are acutely aware of the concern and upset that the public may have in respect of the matters reported.
Any person who is concerned that they have been the victim of harassment following the uploading of personal explicit imagery online without their consent, at any time, should contact their local Garda Station.
Discord
The Victims Alliance, an advocacy group, yesterday told TheJournal.ie that tens of thousands of images have recently been shared on various online platforms.
The group is working to identify the victims but said many of them are Irish.
Linda Hayden, who co-founded the Victims Alliance, said members of the group forwarded the files or folders marked as ‘minors’ to An Garda Síochána.
Many of the images have been shared in forums on Discord, an online messaging platform.
At least one forum on the website where users were sharing images has been removed, Hayden said. The forum in question had about 500 users, all of whom were banned from the website.
The first server was initially deleted by its owners, along with all the photos on it, once it started attracting attention online. A second server was then set up as a replacement for the original server.

Gardaí looking into allegations that large number of images of women were shared online without their consent
A spokesperson for Discord told TheJournal.ie that as soon as the website “became aware of this server, we permanently deleted it” and “identified and banned the approximately 500 users involved”.
“We deleted it and banned its users before they could upload pictures again. We continue to monitor proactively for any new attempt to recreate a server.”
The spokesperson said the company “will cooperate on this matter with Irish authorities subject to applicable law”.
“No one should have to endure the pain of having private images posted online without their consent.
“Discord has a zero-tolerance approach to nonconsensual pornography and child sexual abuse material, and we work aggressively and proactively to keep it off of our service,” they added.
Conversations between users on Discord are private, but not end-to-end encrypted so administrators can view the content if inappropriate behaviour is reported.
Images of females have also been uploaded to pornography sites without their consent.
A Garda spokesperson earlier confirmed to TheJournal.ie that AGS is “aware of the reports and Assistant Commissioner (Organised & Serious Crime) has commenced probative enquires into the matter”.
Hayden said some of the images and videos in question were taken by the victims and privately shared but were later publicly shared without their consent or knowledge.
Many of the images were taken from online platforms such as OnlyFans, Tinder, WhatsApp and Instagram.

Legislation 
Image-based abuse is covered in the Harassment, Harmful Communications, and Related Offences Bill. The legislation was first proposed by Labour in May 2017, but it was not passed prior to the dissolution of the last government.
The Bill will be brought before the Justice Committee on 1 December. After the Bill is debated in the Dáil, it will go before the Seanad.
The legislation, if passed, could see offenders sentenced to up to seven years in prison.

BORIS JOHNSON HAS judged the ministerial code was not breached by Priti Patel amid allegations of bullying despite an inquiry into her conduct finding she had “not consistently met the high standards expected of her”.
The Prime Minister’s adviser on ministerial standards, Sir Alex Allan, resigned in response to Johnson’s decision to keep Patel as Home Secretary.
A government statement said Johnson has “full confidence” in Patel and “considers this matter now closed”.
Patel apologised for upset caused by her behaviour, saying in a statement: “It has never been my intention to cause upset to anyone.”
Speaking this evening, Patel also said she is “absolutely sorry for anyone” that she has upset.
“I’m sorry that my behaviour has upset people, and I’ve never intentionally set out to upset anyone,” she said.
“I work with thousands of brilliant civil servants every single day and we work together, day in day out, to deliver on the agenda of this government.” 
Normally ministers are expected to resign if they breach the code.
Sir Alex concluded Patel’s behaviour – which was said to include some occasions of shouting and swearing – met the definition of bullying adopted by the civil service.
In his advice, he said: “The definition of bullying adopted by the Civil Service accepts that legitimate, reasonable and constructive criticism of a worker’s performance will not amount to bullying.
“It defines bullying as intimidating or insulting behaviour that makes an individual feel uncomfortable, frightened, less respected or put down. Instances of the behaviour reported to the Cabinet Office would meet such a definition.”
He said his advice was that Patel has “not consistently met the high standards required by the ministerial code of treating her civil servants with consideration and respect”.
He added: “Her approach on occasions has amounted to behaviour that can be described as bullying in terms of the impact felt by individuals. To that extent her behaviour has been in breach of the ministerial code, even if unintentionally.”
However, he said there was “no evidence that she was aware of the impact of her behaviour, and no feedback was given to her at the time”.

He added: “The high pressure and demands of the role, in the Home Office, coupled with the need for more supportive leadership from top of the department has clearly been a contributory factor.
“In particular, I note the finding of different and more positive behaviour since these issues were raised with her.”
A Cabinet Office investigation was launched in March over allegations that Patel belittled colleagues and clashed with senior officials in three different departments.
It followed the resignation of the Home Office’s permanent secretary Sir Philip Rutnam, who accused Patel of a “vicious and orchestrated briefing campaign” against him and is claiming constructive dismissal at an employment tribunal.
Patel has expressed concern at the “false” claims, and allies have described her as a “demanding” boss but not a bully.

Kenny met Owens this afternoon to discuss the matter, and The42 understands it was a positive meeting from the Irish manager’s point of view as Owens did not raise any significant issues 
There is no suggestion Kenny’s job is under threat. 
Kenny is due to meet with the new permanent CEO Jonathan Hill, chairman Roy Barrett and other members of the board of management later this evening. 
Owens is still serving as interim CEO at the FAI during a handover month with permanent CEO Jonathan Hill. Owens is working out of Abbottstown with Hill still working remotely from London, and Owens is understood to be overseeing much of the day-to-day running of the Association as Hill acquaints himself with the bigger picture at the FAI. 
The Daily Mail reported last night members of the Irish squad took issue with the political nature of a motivational video shown to players before kick-off at Wembley last week, with the newspaper describing it as “anti-British.”

In a statement, the FAI said they were “aware of issues surrounding content” shown to the team prior to kick-off, and said they would investigate the issue as “a matter of urgency” to “establish the facts.” 
The42 understands the video was roughly three minutes depicting scenes from Anglo-Irish history, including the Easter Rising, prefacing a montage of previous Irish goals scored against England. 
One well-placed source within the camp told The42 the reaction to the video was “blown out of all proportion.”
Another Abbottstown source – not among the Irish travelling party last week – said the bigger issue was with the political nature of Kenny’s team-talk, and that senior, Irish-born players raised the issue with senior FAI staff. 
Separate sources who were among the FAI staff at Wembley and in the senior camp for the duration of the window say they were unaware of any players voicing their concern with either the video or the team talk during camp.

424,180,"German reunification a 'useful example' of how planned Irish reunification could work, says Sinn Féin",https://www.thejournal.ie/sinn-fein-irish-unity-paper-5273158-Nov2020/,"SINN FÉIN HAS launched a document on why the party believes there are economic benefits to a united Ireland.
The report disputes the £10 billion Northern Ireland’s subvention figure – its UK subsidy – stating it is about half the official figure.
The report also cites the experience of German reunification as a “useful example of how planned economic integration and investment, including from the EU, can substantially improve economic conditions in the smaller jurisdiction involved in transition”.
The EU played a pivotal role in supporting German reunification, the report states, adding that the “role of the EU should be even more central in the case of Irish reunification”.
“Direct support from the EU could come in the form of a bespoke funding mechanism designed to stabilise the process of reunification, however gradual this process may be,” states the report.
In relation of the subvention, which is the difference between the revenue raised and the money spent in the North, the report states that the pensions bill is £3.5 billion, so “the final subvention cost could be as low as £2.5 billion.”
A similar point is made in a report on a united Ireland by Fianna Fáil senator Mark Daly, now Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, who found that the UK would continue paying Northern Ireland’s pensions initially as the pension liability was accrued while Northern Ireland was part of the United Kingdom.
There has been much debate about the actual figure between economists and politicians.
The report states that Irish unity will “create new opportunities and new prosperity for all the people of the island of Ireland”. The party called on the Irish Government to make preparations and to examine the economic arguments, as well as the cultural and social dimensions.
This isn’t the first time the party has claimed reunificaion would not cost as much as people might think. A similar paper in 2016 stated that the issue of affordability has been subject to “wild speculation”.

Berlin prosecutors said today they are “investigating at full speed to shed light on the sexual murder with suspicion of a cannibalistic background”.
The man was arrested on Wednesday in connection with the disappearance of a 44-year-old man in the German capital in September.
Police did not name the suspect, but Bild daily identified him as Stefan R., a high school maths and chemistry teacher.
Police published a photo of the victim, named as Stefan T., after he disappeared and sought information from the public, but without success.
The bones were found by people strolling in a park in the north-eastern Pankow district on 8 November, with forensic analysis later showing them to be Stefan T.’s remains.
Further forensic investigations then led them to the 41-year-old suspect, police said.
“Based on the bones found, which were completely stripped of flesh, and further evidence, we strongly suspect that Stefan T. was the victim of a cannibal,” a police officer told Bild.
Investigators reportedly found a large fridge in his cellar, but it was empty.
They also secured chats from an online platform where the victim and the suspect had arranged to meet, Bild reported.

The case recalls that of Detlev Guenzel, a German ex-police officer convicted of murdering a willing victim he met on a website for cannibalism fetishists and chopping him up in an S&M chamber.
Guenzel, 58, had cut the body into small pieces in a slaughter chamber he built in his cellar, before burying them in his garden. There was no evidence that he ate any part of his victim.
In another case that shocked Germany, Armin Meiwes, nicknamed the “cannibal of Rotenburg”, was sentenced to life in prison in 2006.

427,215,"'God can help us': Cavan priest will continue to hold Mass despite Level 5 rules",https://www.thejournal.ie/cavan-priest-hold-mass-5273266-Nov2020/,"A CAVAN PRIEST has said that he will continue to hold Mass for locals despite a warning from Gardaí that this is against the current Covid-19 restrictions.
Father PJ Hughes, a parish priest at Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Mullahoran, held a Mass last Sunday where around 50 people attended. 
Speaking on RTÉ Radio One’s Today with Claire Byrne programme, Fr Hughes said that Gardaí called five minutes before the Mass was due to start, said he was in breach of the regulations, and that he should tell those who had gathered to go home.
“It was a punch in the stomach, it was the worst time to come… if it was an hour before… It made me sad.”
He said that he told Gardaí he wasn’t telling people to go home, as “it would be a huge insult to their faith”. He said the church normally accommodates around 500 people. 
“That was only the start of it,” Father Hughes said. Gardaí informed him after the Mass that a file had been prepared for the Director of Public Prosecutions and that if he was convicted, he could face a fine of up to €2,500, and spend up to six months in prison.
Religious services are not permitted under Level Five restrictions, but places of worship, like churches, can remain open for individuals to pray. 25 people are allowed at weddings and 25 at funerals, and some priests have been hosting online Masses.
During the interview, the priest said that the right to practice their religion was important, and that as far as he was concerned, he “broke no law”.
“I’m here to serve the Church and the people, not the government,” he said. 
“We’re told not to baptise anybody now, not to celebrate the sacraments, that’s unbelievable.
It’s telling people you cannot practice your faith. Are we going to live in a Communist state or what? I know the virus is there, but at the same time, we have to live.
God can help us, god is creater of heaven and Earth. A scientist cannot tell me that what he does is more important than what god does.

When it was put to him that a scientist would tell him that your faith won’t stop you transmitting a virus from one person to another, the priest said “well I can tell you, that scientist is wrong, because god has healed people, he has even raised people from the dead”.
He said that he would continue the I am saying Mass, but would not publicise what time the Mass is at.
“The Government has no regard for people who are living alone,” he said, adding that his parishioners are “100% supportive behind me”, and that “not one person” has said he should stop celebrating Mass.
“We have a divine right to worship god, somebody show me the law that says I’m wrong.”
Dr Gabriel Scally, a public health physician said that he was “really quite shocked” at the comments. 
I understand that people have strong religious views and strong religious faith, but I don’t see why – particularly at this time – they have to be exercised together. People can pray to their god and worship their god and say their prayers by themselves.
He said that during the pandemic, it was “wrong” for people to gather together, particularly elderly or vulnerable people. He said it’s not just the people who gather who are at risk, because it can spread beyond that to others in their community.

At the High Court today, Barry McArdle (34) from Drimnagh in Dublin, but who had been living in Galway, formally surrendered himself to the Netherlands over the stabbing and dismemberment of Keith Ennis (29).
The deceased suffered a fatal upper-body stab wound in Rotterdam in 2009 before his body was disposed of in a watercourse between Rotterdam and Amsterdam.
Dutch authorities successfully appealed McArdle’s previous acquittal on a charge of manslaughter and he was sentenced to 12 years and three months imprisonment in his absence by the Amsterdam Court of Appeal on 17 May, 2018.
Ms Caroline Cummings SC, for the Minister of Justice, told Mr Justice Paul Burns at today’s extradition hearing that a warrant had been issued in the Netherlands for McArdle on 22 April of this year.
The warrant was endorsed by the High Court in Ireland on 6 June, and McArdle was arrested in Galway on 1 July on foot of a European Arrest Warrant, she said.
McArdle had been convicted in the Netherlands in 2017 for his part in dismembering the body of Ennis but had already served the two years imposed on him by the time of his conviction.
McArdle had been found not guilty of the stabbing of Ennis, however, and was released by Dutch authorities in May 2017, when he immediately moved back to Ireland.
The public prosecutor in the Netherlands successfully appealed the not-guilty verdict and in 2020, after a Supreme Court ruling upheld that decision, McArdle was found guilty of the stabbing and sentenced to 13 years.
Counsel for the Minister said that the balance of McArdle’s sentence left to serve was 4,514 days.
McArdle was found guilty of “murder/manslaughter and of removing or disposing Ennis’ body in order to conceal the cause of death”, she said.
Surgery appointment
The judge remanded McArdle in custody for 10 days, pending his surrender to the Netherlands.
Responding barrister, Leanora Frawley BL, for McArdle, said that her client had a “one-off” opportunity in Ireland for a surgical procedure to remove a colostomy bag.

Counsel said that McArdle had an appointment for the surgery but would need a consultation before undergoing the procedure and asked the judge for bail on that day, which is yet to be arranged.
The court previously heard that McArdle had a section of his bowel removed, had a colostomy bag fitted and that he could not lift anything heavier than a kettle.
Remanding McArdle in custody, the judge said the court noted McArdle’s circumstances and adjourned matters to Friday 27 November to allow time for either an affidavit or sworn evidence to be presented to the court regarding McArdle’s medical procedure.
At a previous bail hearing at the High Court, which was refused, Detective Garda Eoin Kane of the Garda Extradition Unit said McArdle was a flight risk and that he has 19 previous convictions, including possession of €1 million-worth of diamorphine for the purpose of sale or supply.

Something needs to change' - Rooney",https://www.the42.ie/wayne-rooney-says-something-needs-to-change-with-dementia-in-football-5272910-Nov2020/,"WAYNE ROONEY SAYS “something needs to change” as too many former footballers are dying of dementia.
Nobby Stiles, like Rooney a former Manchester United and England player, died at the age of 78 last month, having been diagnosed with dementia and prostate cancer.
The death of the 1966 World Cup winner and the news team-mate Sir Bobby Charlton had also been diagnosed with dementia saw a renewed call for more investigations into the issues of head impacts and an increased risk of neurodegenerative disease.
Stiles’ son John has backed calls to look at the amount of heading professional players do in training, while Sir Geoff Hurst and former England striker Gary Lineker want heading restricted in training at all levels.
Rooney said:
It’s very important. I think the amount of players who have died in recent years from the disease is too many.
“It’s difficult to see former players dying so young and knowing football might have been a part of that. It’s really sad. You feel sad for the families of these guys who’ve passed way.
The more research, the better. If that means with young children we stop them heading the ball in training…I don’t know – but clearly something needs to change to make sure this doesn’t happen to the next generation of players.”
Rooney, currently interim manager at Sky Bet Championship strugglers Derby, continued: “There’s times when you see these things happening to former players, losing their lives, of course it crosses your mind.
“Obviously when you have young children you don’t want to lose your life so early because you headed the ball too many times.
“If not heading the ball so many times in training means you’re going to live another 10-15 years then that’s the natural thing, that’s the thing that makes most sense to do.
“My eldest boy (Kai), when we lived in the United States, in his football team heading was banned in training and games.
“I thought, ‘how could the ball be coming into young kids and them not head it?’ But no one did, they let the ball run through.”

Meanwhile, West Brom manager Slaven Bilic says potential changes to training methods and ball design must be explored.
The 52-year-old accepts the game would not be the same if heading was banned completely, but believes more can be done to reduce potential associated problems with small adjustments to training.
He said: “I headed the ball and it was a big part of my game. To be good in a game you have to do it in training.
“Now I think the situation is a bit better today because if you are talking about when (former West Brom and England striker) Jeff Astle played, for example – those types of balls were, like, big.

“When I started the balls were heavy. They were full of water when it was raining or wet.
“I remember in training when you headed you thought sometimes, ‘it is a hard ball.’ Nowadays the balls are much lighter.
“If they find out through the research that heading the ball 10 times during training is going to cause you dementia, then let’s stop it. Let’s find a way.
“But for me the great thing going forward is they are talking about it and recognising it.
“What solution they are going to find I don’t know, but they are spending hours, days and months researching it and they will have to do something.
“But are they going to stop heading in games? Then it’s not football any more.
“It’s a great thing and it was about time for the game to recognise it. It’s a great step forward.”
He added: “I remember (as a young player) we used to play with a smaller, lighter ball, so there is a way, especially with the better technology.
“We had a great exercise. The ball was on a rope and you were heading it all the time, but that ball doesn’t have to be a proper ball.
“It is not about the ball but the opposition and your timing. It is about your leap and jump.
“If I think about it now I would say why not stop it completely? The kids can have a ball, but maybe a plastic, soft ball or a sponge ball.”

Eamonn Harrison, 23, allegedly successfully dropped off two loads of people at Zeebrugge in Belgium before the Vietnamese nationals died in his trailer en route to Purfleet in Essex on October 22 last year.
Giving evidence at the Old Bailey, Harrison denied people smuggling, saying he only agreed to load stolen lorry parts for his boss Ronan Hughes because he owed him after drunkenly writing off one of his trucks.
He has claimed that a Romanian he knew as Alex, aka Petrisor Zgarcea, was Hughes’ “man on the continent” and he went for a walk when people were loaded on his trailer without his knowledge on two occasions.
On October 18, a delivery of macaroons and Bakewell tarts, which were transported in the same trailer as people, were rejected due to human contamination.
Prosecutor Bill Emlyn Jones told Harrison: “You have dreamt up stolen lorry parts because on this night a load of illegal immigrants were smuggled in your trailer.”
Harrison replied that it was “without my knowledge”.
The prosecutor said: “That load when it got to the UK was rejected because of human contamination.”
He asked what Harrison had talked about in a seven-minute and 36-second call with Hughes on October 18.
Harrison said: “I cannot remember exactly. I know he did tell me the load had been rejected and the trailer was coming back to me.”
Mr Emlyn Jones went on: “You can imagine what was on his mind at that time.
What you have got to talk about is the fact the load he has spent all morning sorting out… was all trodden down and all the biscuits were broken and crushed.
“He does not know the load has been rejected because the load hasn’t got to Sittingbourne.
“I suggest here are two people engaged in people smuggling talking about their people smuggling.”
The defendant denied it, telling jurors: “I was naive and gullible.”
“I was to work off the debt with reduction in wage. It would have taken me a year. I did not know I was involved in people smuggling.”
Turning to the fatal trip on October 22, Mr Emlyn Jones asserted: “It was a double load of 39 migrants and you have loaded them in two stages.”

The defendant denied it.
Jurors were shown video footage of Harrison walking around the pick-up point near Bierne in northern France that morning.
Mr Emlyn Jones suggested that Harrison had concocted a lie, about being told to go for a walk while migrants were being loaded, from viewing the video.
The prosecutor said: “You have built a lie.
Your excuse for not knowing what’s happening on the 10th and 17th was you were told to take a walk – a masterstroke of subterfuge.
“Hughes tells you to take a walk, you can turn a blind eye to what’s going on in your trailer. It’s based on this clip. You fake a defence around that evidence.”
The defendant has told jurors he initially lied about what happened out of “fear” but decided to tell the truth later.
Harrison, of Co Down, Northern Ireland, has denied the manslaughter of 39 migrants and being involved in a wider people-smuggling operation.

Rooney, 34, accused Vardy, 38, of leaking “false stories” about her private life to the media last October after carrying out a months-long “sting operation” which saw her dubbed “Wagatha Christie”.
The wife of former England star Wayne Rooney claimed fellow footballer’s wife Vardy shared fake stories she had posted on her personal Instagram account with The Sun newspaper.
Rooney wrote on Instagram and Twitter: “I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them.
“It’s ……………. Rebekah Vardy’s account.”
Vardy, who is married to Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy, denies the accusations and is suing Rooney for damages for libel.
In a judgment today, Mr Justice Warby ruled that the “natural and ordinary” meaning of Rooney’s posts was that Vardy had “regularly and frequently abused her status as a trusted follower of Ms Rooney’s personal Instagram account by secretly informing The Sun newspaper of Ms Rooney’s private posts and stories”.
Announcing his decision, the judge said that the meaning he had determined was “substantially the same as the claimant’s meaning”.
He also granted costs of £22,913.50 to Vardy pending the end of the trial.  
In his ruling, Mr Justice Warby said Mrs Rooney’s message was “a considered post, using wording composed with some care”, adding:
It would be clear to the ordinary reader from the outset that it was meant seriously, and intended to convey a message of some importance.
He also rejected Mrs Rooney’s contention that she simply referred to Vardy’s Instagram account, rather than Vardy herself.
The judge ruled: “I certainly do not think that the ordinary reader would take that single word (account), albeit repeated, to indicate that Mrs Rooney remains in doubt about who the wrongdoer was.”
He added: “There is nothing in these words, apart from the word ‘account’, that in any way suggests that the behaviour of which Mrs Rooney is complaining might have been carried out by anyone other than the account holder, Mrs Vardy.”
“I do not believe or assume that anything done on social media in the name of a personality might be done by someone else, without the knowledge or approval of the account holder,” the judge said.
“Nor do I believe that everyone thinks or believes or assumes these things. It is more likely that there is a range of facts, and a range of opinions, with some cynics thinking every tweet by every celebrity is made up by some PR and others naively believing that every such tweet is always the celebrity’s own unassisted work.” 
Defence
At a hearing on yesterday, Vardy’s barrister Hugh Tomlinson QC said Rooney’s posts were an “untrue and unjustified defamatory attack” which was “published and republished to millions of people”.
He added: “In fact, she did nothing wrong. Whatever leaks there were did not come from her.”

David Sherborne, representing Rooney, argued that it was “true” that Vardy was “responsible for consistently passing on information about the defendant’s private Instagram posts and stories to The Sun”.
He said: “Mrs Rooney intends to defend these words as true in whatever meaning.”
Tomlinson told the court he would be seeking costs of £22,913.50 from Rooney at this point as it is usual that “the losing party pays the costs”
Sherborne, for Rooney, said the meaning argued by Vardy’s lawyers and the meaning ruled by Mr Justice Warby were different in some respects and ultimately does not affect how the case proceeds.
He added: “It is true in either meaning because Mrs Vardy was responsible for the source of those leaks whether herself or through her agent.”
Mr Justice Warby granted costs to Mrs Vardy at this stage, rather than waiting for the end of the trial.
The court also heard both Vardy and Rooney had agreed for a “stay” of the proceedings until February, so there could be “one final attempt to resolve the matter without the need for a full trial”.","The judge found that the posts by Rooney “clearly identified” Vardy.",1,0,0,49700,"Fri 2:38 PM"

The preliminary hearing is being held into the death of the 63-year-old, who died of a morphine overdose and a heart problem at his home in Portsmouth, Hampshire, seven days after he had filmed The Jeremy Kyle Show last year.
He took a lie detector test on the programme to show whether he had cheated on his ex-fiancee Jane Callaghan, from Gosport.
Coroner Jason Pegg said he has made Kyle an “interested person” for the inquest, stating the presenter is someone “who may have caused or contributed to the death of Stephen Dymond”.
He added: “It might seem ludicrous not to have Mr Kyle to give evidence to give his take on the situation.”
Counsel for Dymond’s family Caoilfhionn Gallagher QC told the Winchester hearing that Dymond became “distressed” after he failed the lie detector test.
She said he had gone on the show to “prove his fidelity”, and had said: “I pushed and pushed but it all went wrong.”
Gallagher said after the result was announced during filming, the audience “booed and jeered” at him and he was “called a failure by the presenter”.
She said Kyle was “in his face” and even when he was “at the point of collapsing, he was still being heckled”.
She said Mr Dymond sought to leave through a side door but found it locked, and she added: “He couldn’t escape the heckling. He was on his hands and knees because he thought he was going to pass out from the stress.”
Gallagher said his state of mind was known by the crew on the show, with a message sent on a WhatsApp group stating: “Just so you know, he’s still crying, he has just said he wishes he was dead. Just giving you the heads up.”
Gallagher added: “While he was still on the programme, within minutes, he was talking about wishing he was dead.”
She said Dymond called his brother as he was taken home by taxi from the show.
In a statement read to the hearing, Leslie Dymond said: “He seemed completely broken and frightened and told me he couldn’t go on living.”

Personal attorney to the President, Rudy Giuliani, appeared at a press conference yesterday where he alleged that there was widespread voter fraud in key battleground states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia.
The former mayor of New York has been instrumental to Trump’s legal action to try and overturn the election, using court cases in multiple states to try and stall the vote certification process.
The main evidence from Giuliani stems from sworn affidavits from poll watchers in battleground states. However, as volunteer observers, poll watchers do not play a role in auditing elections.
With hair dye running down his cheeks, Giuliani stated that he has evidence President Trump won both Michigan and Pennsylvania decisively. 
“I can prove to you that he won Pennsylvania by 300,000 votes. I can prove to you that he won Michigan by probably 50,000 votes,” said Giuliani, citing a mass voter fraud conspiracy by Democrats. Giuliani did not provide this evidence beyond statements from poll watchers.
However, in multiple states, election officials have said that there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud.
Republican Secretary of State for Georgia, Brad Raffensperger, confirmed that there was no widespread voter fraud in Georgia.
Speaking to CNN on Wednesday, Raffensperger said that while Trump picked up some votes due to clerical errors in multiple counties, it would not be enough to overtake President-Elect Joe Biden.
The Georgia recount was completed early this morning after a hand count due to the tight margin that forced an automatic recount. Georgia’s 16 electoral votes will go to Biden when the Electoral College meets in December.
Chris Krebs, the Trump administration election official sacked last week over comments about the security of the 2020 election, tweeted about Giuliani’s press conference: “That press conference was the most dangerous 1hr 45 minutes of television in American history. And possibly the craziest.”

Late Night
Late-night TV hosts in the US had a field day with the conference, referencing the streams of hair dye that were visible on Giuliani’s face.
Host of “The Tonight Show”, Jimmy Fallon, mocked Giuliani for sweating profusely throughout the entire conference.

“Nothing screams confident lawyer like a guy standing in front of everyone dripping in sweat,” said Fallon, “He’s sweating like Borat just walked into the room.”
Giuliani has previously denied being inappropriate when he appears in a scene in Borat 2, calling the scene “a complete fabrication”.

“Daily Show” host Trevor Noah laughed at Giuliani’s hair mishap, comparing it to a chinstrap beard growing quickly.

The Tánaiste and Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications Eamon Ryan met with Eir and Vodafone separately this morning to relay concerns they have been receiving regarding poor customer service.
The issue has been raised by both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael politicians over the last number of weeks.
Fine Gael’s Patrick O’Donovan, Emer Higgins and Michael Creed raised customer complaints at a recent parliamentary party meeting.
While Fianna Fáil’s Robert Troy tweeted a letter he received from elderly constituents about the lack of customer care.
The constituent, in his 70s, wrote to the TD seeking help in getting his service reconnected.
“He and his wife are alone – their children live overseas and they have been trying to get their service back for the past 6 weeks,” said Troy.
TDs across all parties acknowledge that it is a huge political issue at constituency level. 
Following the meeting, the Tánaiste said: 
“This is something which is causing a huge amount of frustration for people. This mornings meetings were useful. It was good to hear first-hand from the companies. Both companies set out their plans to resolve the issues causing problems, so I really hope we see things improving for customers soon.”
Minister Ryan said
“It was important to relay the level of dissatisfaction being experienced by people who are doing their best to work from home. The two companies outlined the solutions they are working on, and we should see improvements in the near future. While we are rolling out the National Broadband Plan, we also need existing services to offer a high standard of service.  ”
Both ministers also thanked Eir for their work in supporting  the acceleration of the National Broadband Plan and encouraged further engagement to ensure broadband can be brought to every home, farm and business in the country as quickly as possible.

It is understood that the company acknowledged that there is a problem, and that a lot of it was down to increased demand, as well as staff working home during the Level 5 restrictions.
In a recent statement, the company said resolving care wait times is their number one priority.
Eir said it wishes to “apologise for the delays some customers have experienced. The Covid-19 pandemic has made managing our call centres in Sligo, Limerick and Cork challenging, with more than 400 care agents transitioned to working from home overnight, the closure of our retail stores, and a dramatic increase in call volumes caused by more households working and learning from home”.
“We have been recruiting nationally since restrictions eased during the summer. We are proud to have hired 92 new recruits to our care team, with further team members joining in the weeks ahead. Training does take time but these changes have already led to reductions in call wait times.”

In a statement today, the Coast Guard and the RNLI said that over the past number of weeks, there has been a noted increase in the number of incidents in relation to open water swimming, which had resulted in increased demands being placed on the groups. 
Over the past week, eight separate incidents arose in the Dublin-Wicklow area alone, with a number of other incidents being reported around the country. 
The search and rescue services said most people who participate in open water swimming do so safely but some, and in particular those who are new to the sport, may be unaware of important safety measures which can help them avoid getting into difficulty. 
The Coast Guard and the RNLI are now asking the public to familiarise themselves with key safety measures before engaging in the activity.
“At the outset, we are grateful that anybody who sees someone in trouble or thinks they may be in trouble, dials 112 and alerts the Coast Guard,” Gerard O’Flynn, Coast Guard head of operations said.
“Seasoned open water swimmers have a great deal of experience and do observe proper safety precautions. However the dangers this time of the year far outweigh the challenges that apply in summer time,” he said.
RNLI Water Safety Lead Kevin Rahill added: “Cold water and currents can tire a swimmer quickly and make it harder to return to shore.

“Lifeboat crews are seeing a lot more callouts to people who are taking part in water based activities by themselves and while it is great to enjoy our beautiful waters, this time of year, the water temperature drops and of course it is dark for longer.”
The Coast Guard and RNLI have shared the following safety advice for swimmers, highlighting the dangers of swimming alone and the importance of being monitored from the shore:
Always check the weather forecast and understand the local effects of wind, tides and currents.
Never swim alone and have somebody ashore who is familiar with your plans and ideally can observe your progress.
Only swim in sheltered areas with which you are familiar and swim parallel to the shore.
Ensure that you are visible from the shore. Wear a brightly coloured swim cap or use a tow float to increase your visibility in the water.
Wearing a wetsuit is advisable to help stay warm.
Slowly acclimate to cold water to reduce the risk of cold water shock.
Get warmed up afterwards. Wrap up well in extra layers of clothing
If in doubt, don’t go out.
Tell someone else where you’re going and when you are due back.
If you see somebody in trouble or think they are in trouble, dial 112 and ask for the Coast Guard. ","Over the past week, eight separate incidents arose in the Dublin-Wicklow area alone.",9,0,0,16602,"Fri 12:10 PM"

News presenters Bryan Dobson, David McCullagh and Miriam O’Callaghan were among those to issue apologies after being pictured not wearing masks at the gathering.
The gathering took place on the final day of work for a long-time employee, with the above named presenters and managing director of RTÉ News Jon Williams each posing for photographs.
A report on what happened featured on the front page of The Irish Sun newspaper this morning.
The National Union of Journalists has called for an urgent review into the breach of public health guidelines at RTÉ.
RTÉ said in a statement that it was a “short impromptu gathering in a public area” and that “a small number of RTÉ personnel working” attended.
RTÉ News has reported on the apologies and has published some of the photographs on its website. 
Williams said he was “not thinking” about his actions. 
“I deeply regret not thinking through the consequences of a momentary lapse of judgement. It was wrong and I’m very sorry,” he said. 
Dobson said: “I deeply regret what was a momentary but nonetheless serious lapse of judgement for which I unreservedly apologise”.
McCullagh apologised for “an error of judgement which I deeply regret” and O’Callaghan made similar comments.

Wlliams (C) said he was 'not thinking' when the photograph was taken.
In a statement about the incident, the broadcaster said that “RTÉ takes public health advice with the utmost seriousness and has implemented detailed workplace protocols”. 
The broadcaster added that no Covid-19 cases had “so far been transmitted on campus” during the pandemic. 
On the gathering itself, RTÉ said most of what happened adhered to guidelines.
“While social distancing was observed overall and in compliance with RTÉ’s site protocols, as photos in the press today show, a number of those present briefly posed for a photo with their departing colleague, before returning to work,” RTÉ said.
These contacts were not close contacts as defined by HSPC guidelines. They were brief casual contacts which, while well intentioned, were unnecessarily risky and should not have happened.
“RTÉ and those involved regret this occurred. Over the last few days we have reminded all staff of their obligations to keep both themselves and the site safe, particularly over the very busy few weeks we are heading into.”
NUJ secretary Seamus Dooley has welcomed RTÉ’s apology but he says that the incident should not have happened and it has potentially damaged RTÉ’s ability to hold others to account.

“RTE workers have worked extremely hard since March and have held public figures to account for their actions,” said Dooley.
I have been contacted by a number of members who believe this incident has the capacity to undermine that hard-earned trust and confidence.

I am a teacher working in a primary school. I was on maternity leave last year when Covid ‘hit’ so while my colleagues were scrambling to prepare for distance learning, I was knee-deep in bottles and holding my baby tight as I listened to the news each night.
When I returned to work in September, I, like all my colleagues, was apprehensive and scared about what to expect. With a small baby at home, I was worried but I believed the experts and trusted the public health team and put on a smile (behind a mask) to welcome our children back to school.
The return to school wasn’t easy. I was placed on supervising duties in the morning which meant standing at the gate before school began and only allowing parents and children in at the allocated time.
Very often, parents were early and not too pleased to have to wait outside the school gate. The mornings that it was raining, were the worst of course, with people losing their patience very quickly.
The new narrative
Parents were stressed, people were worried. I dreaded going to work but not because of the fear of covid transmission but because of the morning supervision and the never-ending looks of disgust on the faces of parents as we tried to protect the school community and keep the children safe.
After a few weeks when the routine was in place this all calmed down and mornings began to run smoothly. People started saying hello again and waving as they passed.
The children were delighted to be back at school and we all got on with it and adjusted to the new norm. We were still very worried of course at the prospect of a Covid outbreak but it appeared anxiety levels were lessening.
This welcomed change in atmosphere was short-lived. As soon as the ASTI union balloted in favour of industrial action the social media backlash hit an all-time peak. As I listened to the radio in the morning going to work, I was blasted by anti-teacher discussion and debate. One morning I had a cry on my 40-minute commute, just exhausted by it all.
Any concerns raised by teachers in relation to Covid were being ignored, as understandably the media feared for their own children’s wellbeing.
A change in tone

I believe the wellbeing of teachers has been largely ignored in the pursuit of the greater good. Our mental health is being damaged daily by the bombardment of abuse on social media as they put on a brave face and head to the frontline. Instead of cheers and claps, we are getting sneers from the public.
The suggestion by the TUI that schools should close early for Christmas filled me with a sense of dread.
I knew what was in store for me on my commute home that day, so I turned the radio off. I had a dentist appointment that evening and he had the radio on in the background. Of course, they were discussing the TUI’s suggestion at length.

Teachers' union asks government to start school Christmas break a few days earlier
As I lay in the chair the dentist said: “I would love an Early Christmas too, wouldn’t you?”. Automatically assuming I would agree with an anti-teacher rhetoric, I suppose. I laughed a little (as much as can with your mouth open) enough for him to realise I was a teacher.
When I left his office that evening, he called after me “I hope you get your early Christmas holidays”. He, like many others, assumed I would be in favour of an early closure but I don’t think schools should close early.
I understand and agree with parents who worry about childcare for those two days. I think that closing early would in the long run lower staff morale because of the reaction the public would have to it. I personally would rather work the day and a half than deal with the negative comments.
Teachers are not teachers’ unions
Just listening to the comments on that programme showed me the low opinion that some members of the public have of teachers. This was not something requested by teachers on the ground, yet, we are taking the criticism.
It is being used as another excuse for an attack on our characters. We live under this constant cloud of fear. Like everyone, Covid-19 is a huge concern. We fear for our family, our vulnerable colleagues, our students but we also fear that people will have some reason to belittle and attack our profession.
We would like to be respected and for our worries to be addressed, without the constant fear of backlash from the public.
As I prepare for work each night I think of my students and how they have adapted so well to what is a much-changed classroom environment. I think of how teaching has changed over the past nine months and how far we have come since March.

Have you seen the size of that lad?'",https://www.the42.ie/quinn-roux-ireland-england-5272955-Nov2020/,"THE COMBINATION BETWEEN a tighthead prop and a tighthead lock is one that can be a little invisible to those of us who don’t put our heads down and shove in scrums, but it can have a telling impact on games.
Last weekend, Andrew Porter and Quinn Roux found a nice blend in this regard, helping Ireland to come out on top of the scrum battle against Wales.
Tomorrow against England is likely to be a very different challenge after Eddie Jones reunited his first-choice front row of Kyle Sinckler, Jamie George, and Mako Vunipola.
The Irish forwards will face a severe test of their scrummaging ability, with Pascal Gaüzère – the referee who penalised Leinster seven times at the scrum against Saracens – sure to be a key man.
England boss Eddie Jones has called into question the legality of Porter’s scrum work but Roux, the man who will be behind Ireland’s tighthead in the second row, has no doubt about the Leinster man’s scrummaging ability.
“He’s probably my bodyguard! Have you seen the size of that lad?” said Roux of Porter.
“I just need to look after him. Not just that, a dominant set-piece looks after our nine, makes life easier for him and our 10s playing on the front foot. It starts up front, that’s what we have to look at first.
“As much I like to be dominant, I need to be able to make that my tighthead is dominant and that’s my main job, making sure that he’s comfortable and making sure he doesn’t take a backward step. That’s a big responsibility but it’s something that I really enjoy and I take pride in.”
Indeed, the Irish pack has a lot to get right.

Over the course of the last three fixtures between these sides, Maro Itoje and co. have come out on top of the contest at set-piece. Ireland’s maul hasn’t really fired in recent weeks and it’s another area where Roux is hoping for improvement tomorrow.
“It’s been a weird one. We had a few opportunities [against Wales last weekend] that we didn’t take. We need to be better in that area.
“We didn’t convert some opportunities five or 10 metres out in the last few weeks, so that’s something to work on and we have been talking about. The other side of the ball is maul defence. Seeing England score three maul tries [against Georgia] last week makes it massive. It’s both sides of the ball.”
Roux’s physicality is one of the main reasons Ireland head coach Andy Farrell has selected him to start against the English, with Tadhg Beirne among the unlucky players to miss out.
The Connacht man delivered an edge in his performance against the Welsh last time out and is relishing the chance to get stuck into the English.
“I think it’s the responsibility of everyone in the team,” says Roux. “Everyone talks a lot about the physicality they are going to bring, but I think we just need to focus on the physicality we can bring and try and match that because we can’t take a backward step this week.
“I am obviously delighted to be involved first of all and then to get the start is very exciting. I just have to make sure that I back last week’s performance up.”

Premier Steven Marshall indicated a tough lockdown for the state’s almost two million people would end late tomorrow, at least two days earlier than planned.
Marshall said a man who claimed he was a customer at a pizza parlour hotspot – leading authorities to believe the strain was virulent enough to be transmitted via a takeaway box – in fact worked there.
“One of the close contacts linked to the Woodville pizza bar deliberately misled our contact-tracing team,” said Marshall. “Their story didn’t add up. We pursued them. We now know that they lied.”
It is unlikely the man will face charges, police said. “The Emergency Management Act requires people to provide information on request,” said police commissioner Grant Stevens. “There is no penalty for failing to truthfully answer those questions.”
Authorities stressed the costly lockdown had still been necessary – and that pizza parlour customers should still come forward for testing.
On Wednesday, they ordered schools, shops, pubs, factories and even takeaway restaurants to close and stay-at-home orders were issued for residents across the state.
Since then, tens of thousands of tests have shown no new community transmission and the cluster totals only 25 cases, leading to accusations that authorities overreacted.

IN ONE WEEK’S time the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) will issue advice to the government about whether Ireland can ease Level 5 restrictions and how it should be done.
Health officials have been asking the public, particularly this week, not to focus too much on changing levels or on what the restriction may be at Christmas, but people are eager to know whether they will be able to spend time with their families and friends and what kinds of activities they may be able to do together.
On Monday, deputy chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn acknowledged that the recent uptick in case numbers may be down to people being “tired of listening to the messages”. 
As we approach the Christmas period, the clarity of those messages and the public’s understanding of them will be important if the country is to avoid another surge in case numbers at the start of 2021, according to Dr Deirdre Robinson, researcher in the ESRI’s Behavioural Research Unit. 
“It’s possible that people are tired of hearing the messages, it has been a long year and it would be understandable, but the data doesn’t really suggest that people are fatigued with the measures,” she told TheJournal.ie.
In the latest Amárach public opinion tracker published today, 66% of people said they believe the government’s reaction to the outbreak is appropriate, 20% believe current restrictions don’t go far enough and just 14% think the current approach is too extreme.
“The vast majority say they are complying with the guidelines and, importantly, think that other people are too,” Robinson said.
“It’s not fully clear what is leading to the recent rise in cases, so we might be at a stage where a more detailed picture of what kinds of activities people are engaging in day-to-day would be useful, including compliant and non-compliant behaviour.
She said compliance with the public health measures over Christmas will “depend on good quality, clear communications”.
“Everybody in Ireland is hyper aware of the virus and people have adapted their behaviours accordingly, it’s been amazing over the last nine months.
“We know from the Amarách tracker consistently the top worry for people is the health of their family and friends, followed by the health system being overloaded.
“If you think about that in terms of meeting friends and friends over Christmas, people will change their behaviour.”
She said certain activities that are generally related to Christmas may increase risk, particularly if alcohol is involved as it “loosens people’s inhibitions”.
“Christmas is an important time for a lot of people and I imagine there could be some flexibility in people’s behaviour around the guidelines, though it depends on what the guidelines are,” she said.
Ensuring people do Christmas safely this year can not just be about telling them what they should not do, she said, but helping them to understand why it is risky. 
“I don’t know that it’s necessarily about whether we should have very strict guidelines and expect people to break them or lax ones that allow flexibility, but rather to have guidelines that people can easily understand and follow.
“It’s particularly important that they can be seen to follow them, if there is a level of policing through social disapproval that can be quite a good deterrent.

“And we’re not talking about manhunts, it’s more a deterrent on ones own behaviour if you think someone in your own social group would disapprove.”
She said apparent frustration or fatigue with the restrictions is not borne out in the data from public opinion surveys.
“People certainly might have low morale in that they’re sick of the virus but in terms of how people think we’re responding to it and how well they say they’re complying with restrictions we haven’t seen that flag.
“Particularly in a situation where our behaviour is the primary defence against the virus, the more we can communicate what behaviours we should be doing to protect us the better.”
From the government side, while it acknowledges the importance of Christmas to people, Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe says that business need certainty beyond the Christmas weeks. 
“I think we do need to look beyond Christmas itself and be aware that the long term and the medium term goal, in advance of a vaccine being broadly available, is to get the spread of the disease down to the lowest level possible,” he told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland.
Christmas is so important from a family point of view and from a well-being point of view and for many from a warship point of view, so I would recoil from saying that we’re in some way caught up with it.
“But I know for example, from an economic point of view, if you talk to somebody who’s running a business, somebody who’s running a restaurant and they’re thinking of reopening it, they do want certainty beyond to 25 December.”

The arrest on Wednesday came just days before the 46th anniversary of the two deadly 21 November blasts which ripped apart the Mulberry Bush and Tavern In The Town pubs.
The individual, understood to be Michael Patrick Reilly, was arrested at an address in Belfast on Wednesday morning by officers from West Midlands Police assisted by the PSNI.
He was arrested under the Terrorism Act and taken to Musgrave Street PSNI custody block in the city, while searches continued at his address throughout the day.
West Midlands Police said he was interviewed under caution at a police station in Northern Ireland but was released after a search of his home was carried out.
Detective Chief Superintendent Kenny Bell, head of Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands CTU, said: “We are committed to finding those responsible for the terrible murders of 21 innocent victims almost 46 years ago.
Let me assure families of the victims and the people of Birmingham that we’re working relentlessly to find the bombers and bring them to justice.
At an inquest into the bombings last year, a jury concluded a botched IRA warning call on the night led to 21 people being unlawfully killed.
The bungled West Midlands Police inquiry in the immediate aftermath of the bombings led to the wrongful convictions of the Birmingham Six, one of the worst miscarriages of justice in legal history.
They were freed in 1991 after their convictions were quashed.
During evidence given at last year’s inquest, an anonymous IRA volunteer named the men he said had been involved in the attacks.

The individual – identified at the hearing only as Witness O – said those who took part were Mick Murray, Seamus McLoughlin and James Francis Gavin, as well as a fourth man, Michael Hayes, who now lives in Dublin.
In a statement issued at the time, Reilly’s lawyer Padraig O Muirigh strongly denied allegations he was involved as being “without any foundation”.
The arrest came a month after Home Secretary Priti Patel said she would consider holding a public inquiry into the bombings.
Patel also said she wants to visit Birmingham to meet justice campaigners, including Julie Hambleton, whose 18-year-old sister Maxine died in the bombings.
Hambleton, who is part of the victims’ families’ campaign group Justice 4 The 21, had called the arrest “monumental”.","West Midlands Police said he was interviewed under caution at a police station in Northern Ireland.",2,0,1,12169,"Fri 8:06 AM"

Scratching one of the few treatments that had shown some initial promise in severe patients, a WHO Guideline Development Group (GDG) of international experts said there was “no evidence based on currently available data that it does improve patient-important outcomes”.
The United States, the European Union and other countries have granted temporary approval for the use of remdesivir after initial research showed it may shorten recovery time in some coronavirus patients. 
US President Donald Trump was treated with remdesivir among other medicines after he tested positive for Covid-19 in October. 
WHO’s recommendation issued today was based on four international randomised trials among more than 7,000 patients hospitalised with the virus. 
Publishing updated treatment guidance in the BMJ medical journal, the panel acknowledged that their recommendation does not mean that remdesivir has no benefit for patients.

But based on the latest figures, costs and delivery methods, it advised “against administering remdesivir in addition to usual care for the treatment of patients hospitalised with Covid-19, regardless of disease severity”.
Manufacturer Gilead said last month that the drug had boosted 2020 third quarter sales by almost $900 million. 
Initially developed as a treatment for the Ebola virus, remdesivir was found in one study published in May to reduce the length of hospital stays for Covid-19 sufferers from 15 to 11 days on average. 
A subsequent WHO pre-print however found the drug “appeared to have little or no effect” on mortality or length of hospitalisation among more than 11,000 hospitalised patients across 30 countries.

California announced a night-time curfew and authorities urged people everywhere not to travel for Thanksgiving as the country was hit by a spike of more than 2,200 deaths – the worst daily toll since May.
An emergency use authorisation request for the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech is expected to be filed with the US Food and Drug Administration today, the government and BioNTech’s co-founder said.
Health Secretary Alex Azar told a White House briefing that the application was coming in the next day, confirming a timeline BioNTech co-founder Ugur Sahin shared with AFP.
“The documents will be finalised today and tomorrow and submitted to the FDA,” Sahin told AFP.
Moncef Slaoui, the scientific head of the US operation to develop a vaccine, said the final green light would probably come in December – a timeframe echoed by Sahin.
The European Union could also approve the vaccine as well as another one by Moderna before the end of next month, EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said yesterday.
The two candidates have taken the lead in the global chase for a solution, after large-scale trial data this month showed their jabs were around 95% effective.
But the speed at which the vaccines have been developed has raised alarm in some quarters.
Top US infectious disease official Anthony Fauci sought to dispel those concerns during a rare briefing by the White House task force yesterday.
“The process of the speed did not compromise at all safety nor did it compromise scientific integrity. It was a reflection of the extraordinary scientific advances in these types of vaccines,” Fauci said.

Jose Luis Alomia Zegarra, Mexico’s director of epidemiology, said there were 100,104 confirmed Covid-19 deaths as of yesterday, leaving the country trailing just the United States, Brazil and India in terms of overall death toll.
The milestone comes less than a week after Mexico said it had topped 1 million registered coronavirus cases, though officials agree the number is probably much higher because of low levels of testing.
Mexico’s living are bearing the scars of the pandemic along with their lost friends and loved ones. Many surviving coronavirus victims say the psychosis caused by the pandemic is one of the most lasting effects.
Mexico resembles a divided country, where some people are so unconcerned they will not wear masks, while others are so scared they descend into abject terror at the first sign of shortness of breath.
The lack of testing — Mexico tests only people with severe symptoms and has performed only around 2.5 million tests in a country of 130 million — combined with the lack of hospitals in many areas and the fear of the ones that do exist, has created a fertile breeding ground for ignorance, suspicion and fear.
Daniel Alfredo Lopez Gonzalez described getting the disease himself. Even though he recovered, the fear was crushing.
“It is a tremendous psychosis. In the end, sometimes the disease itself may not be so serious, but it is for a person’s psyche,” Lopez Gonzalez said.
“That is, knowing that you have a disease like this can kill you as bad as the disease itself.”
But his sister, public health outreach worker Dulce Maria Lopez Gonzalez, whose job involves handing out free surgical masks to residents, has also seen the other side of the psychological maelstrom: those who do not care.

“I saw this person who I had given a mask to, and I told her she shouldn’t be outside without it,” she recalled. “She told me that no, nothing was going to happen to her. Two weeks later we found out she had died of Covid.”
Mexico’s assistant health secretary Hugo Lopez-Gatell bristled when asked about Mexico reaching the 100,000 deaths point.
He criticised the media for “being alarmist” in focusing on the figure, in the same way he has criticised those who suggest the government is undercounting the deaths, those who have questioned the country’s low testing rate or the government’s contradictory and weak advice on using face masks.
“The epidemic is terrible in itself, you don’t have to add drama to it,” he said, suggesting some media outlets were focusing on the number of deaths to sell newspapers or spark “political confrontation”.","Only the US, Brazil and India have recorded more deaths from the virus.",1,0,0,7261,"Fri 7:13 AM"
452,227,"Opinion: 'Thatcher dismissed FitzGerald's proposals but later said she could do business'",https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/northern-ireland-good-friday-agreement-5270942-Nov2020/,"IT’S 35 YEARS this month since British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Irish Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald signed the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which laid out key principles that would subsequently shape the Good Friday peace deal of 1998.
What has only now become publicly known is that underpinning the 1985 deal was the analysis of two Northern Irish law professors, Kevin Boyle and Tom Hadden, neither of whom ever sought to publicise their role.
The men – both professors of law –were unlikely intellectual collaborators. Boyle, an early leader of the Northern Ireland civil rights movement, was a Catholic then teaching at NUI Galway.
Hadden, a Protestant, was a law professor at Queen’s University. Although from warring communities, they had become colleagues and friends in the 1970s, producing books and articles on policing, courts, security policy and human rights in Northern Ireland.
Was the lady for turning?
In late 1983, Garret FitzGerald, concerned about the growing popularity of the IRA’s political wing, Sinn Féin, had convened the New Ireland Forum, a mechanism for Ireland’s constitutional nationalists to develop new approaches to resolve the Northern Ireland conflict.
At a summit with Thatcher in November 1984, FitzGerald offered three proposals based on the Forum’s findings.
But Thatcher brusquely dismissed all three. ‘A unified Ireland was one solution,” she famously told reporters. “That is out. A second solution was confederation of the two states. That is out. A third solution was joint authority. That is out.’
Her comments were widely interpreted as a blanket dismissal of fresh thinking about the Troubles. But in a previously unknown episode, Thatcher then took a paper drafted by Boyle and Hadden in response to the Forum report James Prior, dropped it on the table, and said to FitzGerald, ‘On this, I can do business.’
Boyle-Hadden
The Boyle-Hadden analysis, sent to Thatcher by Northern Ireland Secretary James Prior, described the Forum’s proposals as ‘totally unrealistic.’

Instead, the two academics called for the Irish government to recognise the legitimacy of Northern Ireland and urged that immediate measures ‘be directed toward a fuller recognition of the identity, rights and interests of the nationalist minority in the North, rather than the unionist minority in Ireland as a whole’.

In particular, the Boyle-Hadden paper called for steps to end linguistic and cultural discrimination against nationalists, such as repealing laws banning the display of the Irish flag and naming of streets in Irish, security cooperation between Dublin and Belfast, and specific proposals on power-sharing and minority representation in Northern Ireland.
Any new arrangements, they argued, should be underpinned by a binding international agreement between London and Dublin.
Amid the uproar over Thatcher’s “out, out, out” statement, few observers paid much attention to the fact that in a joint communique, the two prime ministers explicitly stated their interest in a settlement in which ‘the identities of both the majority and minority communities should be recognised and respected.’
Such language echoed Boyle and Hadden’s argument, as, indeed, did Thatcher’s dismissal of the Forum’s three models.
‘I suspect that Maggie Thatcher got her “out, out, out” on the basis of what we had said about each of the options’, Hadden observed years later. “We said none of these options were actually terribly realistic, except in slightly more diplomatic language.”
Despite the controversy, FitzGerald, perhaps because of his awareness of Thatcher’s interest in the Boyle-Hadden paper, kept his cool, while she allowed aides to continue to negotiate.
When the two leaders signed the Anglo-Irish Agreement on 15 November 1985, its central concept was an idea that Boyle and Hadden had long advocated: formal recognition of the right of Northern Ireland’s majority unionists to remain in the United Kingdom while acknowledging the right of Northern nationalists to express their Irish identity.
The Agreement was a watershed moment, foreshadowing some of the key elements of the 1998 Belfast Agreement, on which Boyle and Hadden’s influence, especially in language about protecting human rights, was also substantial.

Understated, key operators
Neither FitzGerald nor Thatcher ever publicly mentioned their conversation about Boyle-Hadden document. I only learned about the episode recently while researching a biography of Boyle.
And for reasons of temperament and tactics, neither Boyle nor Hadden was interested in claiming any credit for the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the subsequent peace process. As Hadden sardonically noted decades later, ‘there are so many people with their fingers on the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Good Friday Agreement. They don’t want people like me and Kevin interfering with their kudos.’
But former Irish president Mary Robinson, herself an influential figure in the search for peace, is not alone in acknowledging Boyle and Hadden’s impact. ‘That they were very influential in the thinking behind these deals,’ she told me, ‘is not in doubt.’
Brexit has called some of the key assumptions of the peace process into question not least the notion that Northern Ireland, the Republic and the UK, as members of the EU, would inexorably be drawn closer together and divisions in the North would gradually begin to fade.
It will take the kind of creativity and empathy that Boyle and Hadden demonstrated in the 1980s to find a way to sustain the peace and promote reconciliation in these uncertain times.

JOE BIDEN HAS won Georgia and its 16 electoral votes after a hand tally of election ballots affirmed the former vice-president’s narrow lead over President Donald Trump.
The hand tally of about 5 million votes stemmed from an audit required by a new state law and was not in response to any suspected problems with the state’s results or an official recount request.
The state has until Friday to certify results that have been certified and submitted by the counties.
Gabriel Sterling, who oversaw the implementation of the state’s new voting system, said on Thursday evening that the audit was complete.
Results were posted on the secretary of state’s website.
No individual county showed a variation in margin larger than 0.73%, and the variation in margin in 103 of the state’s 159 counties was less than 0.05%, Sterling said.
“Every single vote was touched by a human audit team and counted,” he said. “Obviously, the audit confirms the original result of the election, namely that Joe Biden won the presidential contest in the state of Georgia.”
The results that will be certified are the totals certified by the counties, not those resulting from the audit.
Once the state certifies the election results, the losing campaign has two business days to request a recount since the margin remains within 0.5%.
The hand audit was carried out as a result of a new state law.

That recount would be done using scanners that read and tally the votes and would be paid for by the counties, the secretary of state’s office has said.

It was up to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to select the race to be audited, and he said the presidential race made the most sense because of its significance and the tight margin separating the candidates.
Because of that small margin, Raffensperger said a full hand recount was necessary.
Votes that had not previously been counted were found in several counties during the audit, which required re-certification of the election results in those counties.
In Floyd County, more than 2,500 ballots were discovered during the audit that had not previously been scanned, and the secretary of state’s office had called for the firing of the county’s chief elections clerk, Robert Brady.
The county elections board yesterday voted to issue a written reprimand to Mr Brady and, because it was his second written reprimand within six months, to fire him in accordance with county policy, board member Melanie Conrad said in an email.
Several other counties found memory cards with votes that had not been uploaded and counted prior to the audit.","No individual county showed a variation in margin larger than 0.73%.",20,0,0,33801,"Fri 6:59 AM"

The claim has spread in recent days and says that Ireland’s Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), which regulates medicines in Ireland, has not authorised the vaccine.
However, posts with the claim have missed out important information about the authorisation process for medicines and vaccines in Ireland and across the EU.
The Claim
The claim originated on Twitter on 15 November with one social media user sharing a photo of a letter from the HPRA.
In the caption, the Twitter user wrote: “So now we discover that the Fluenz Tetra nasal flu vaccine (being given to our young children right now) has NOT been authorised by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA).”
“I repeat it has NOT been authorised by HPRA,” the user wrote.
The tweet has been retweeted and quote tweeted 247 times and liked 285 times in the last four days.
Source: Twitter
The tweet has been screenshotted and shared to other social media platforms where it has gained traction, including Facebook.
One version of the post on Facebook, which is captioned “poor children”, has been viewed 16,400 times since 16 November.
The image in the post is a photo of a letter sent from the HPRA responding to a question about the vaccine. 
The letter says:
Fluenz Tetra (influenza vaccine, live attenuated, nasal) is authorised by the European Commission for use in all Member States in the European Union since 2013 for prophylaxis of influenza in children and adolescents from 24 months to less than 18 years of age (EU number: EU/1/13/887).
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) assessed Fluenz Tetra to recommend its authorisation in the EU Commission and its condition of use. Further information on the EMA assessment is available from the European public assessment report (EPAR), which is publically [sic] available on the EMA website, together with additional product information and a history of the EMAs further assessments since the time of initial authorisation.
In conclusion, the vaccine was not authorised through the HPRA.”
The Evidence
The Fluenz Tetra vaccine has been authorised for use in Ireland since 2013, and was authorised through a European-wide mechanism in which the HPRA is involved.
The vaccine was authorised through the central European authorisation system for medicines.
When vaccines are authorised at a European level, the decision is valid and legally binding in all EU member states, which means that the vaccine is approved for use in Ireland.
Speaking to TheJournal.ie, a spokesperson for the HPRA said that the letter was “intended to clarify that the Fluenz Tetra vaccine was authorised through the central European authorisation system”.
The spokesperson said that before medicines are made available on the market, they must first be authorised in line with regulations.
“Medicines, including vaccines, will only be authorised once the data submitted to the regulators meets all the requirements of quality, safety and efficacy (effectiveness),” the HPRA said.
“Medicines in Ireland are typically assessed at either a national or decentralised level, where an Irish market authorisation is granted by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), or at a European level, where a centralised assessment is carried out by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the authorisation granted by the European Commission,” they said.
“Once the European Commission grants a marketing authorisation for a medicine, this is valid and legally binding across all EU member states, including Ireland.”
The HPRA, as Ireland’s national medicines regulator, is an active participant in all new product assessments carried out by the EMA and also contributes directly to the safety monitoring of all new medicines once in use.”
Fluenz Tetra first received authorisation for use across the EU by the European Commission in 2013.
It is used for children and teenagers between the ages of 24 months and 18 years and is administered as a nasal spray.
This year, children in Ireland between the ages of 2 and 12 are able to avail of the vaccine for free.

It is a live attenuated vaccine, which means that it is made with influenza viruses that are weakened in a way such that they cannot cause an influenza infection.
Rumours often spread that children who receive the flu vaccine can cause a flu infection in people they come into contact with.
In fact, children who receive the vaccine can shed the weakened virus in the vaccine for a few days after they receive it, but the weakened virus does not cause disease in the person who receives the vaccine or any other person.
The HSE has said that since the vaccine was first licenced, there have been no reported cases of influenza passing from children who received a vaccine to members of their families or close contacts.
The vaccine in use during the 2020/21 flu season contains no aluminum, mercury, or thiomersal, which are often mentioned in anti-vaccination social media posts. 
The Verdict
Posts shared on social media in recent days have claimed that Fluenz Tetra, a flu vaccine given to children as a nasal spray, was not authorised by the Health Products Regulatory Authority.
In fact, the vaccine was authorised through the central European authorisation system, where it was assessed by the European Medicines Agency and granted authorisation by the European Commission.
The HPRA works with the European Medicines Agency during new product assessments and helps to monitor the safety of new medicines once they are in use.
As a result, we rate the verdict that the Fluenz Tetra vaccine has not been authorised by the HPRA: MISLEADING.
As per our verdict guide, this means: The claim either intentionally or unintentionally misleads readers.

greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland for 2019.
The figures show a reduction of 4.5% compared to 2018, which is the largest decrease since 2011.
Significant emission reductions are recorded for the energy industries, agriculture and residential sectors. These decreases come despite modest growth in the domestic economy of 1.7% over the year in question.
However, the figures indicate that Ireland will exceed its 2019 annual EU emissions allocation by 6.98 metric tonnes, which makes it highly unlikely that Ireland will meet its overall 2020 targets, even taking the impact of Covid 19 on emissions in 2020 into account.
Commenting on the figures, director general of the EPA Laura Burke said: “This much needed reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is a welcome step in the right direction.
The figures show that emissions reductions can be achieved and in 2019 there have been reductions in power generation, agriculture and residential sectors.
Source: EPA report
The emission reductions have been driven by a number of factors across the sectors
including:
Energy Industries: Emissions in the energy industries sector showed a decrease of 11.2% in 2019, which is attributable to a 69% decrease in coal and an 8% decrease in peat used in electricity generation. Electricity generated from wind increased by 16% in 2019, with renewables accounting for 37.6% of electricity generated. After 2020, a continued increase in renewable generation levels will be required to meet ambitious future greenhouse gas targets.
Agriculture: Agriculture emissions decreased by 3.9% in 2019. This was driven by reduced fertiliser use (down 10.1%) and a reduction in the quantity of lime used on soils (down 25.4%), which had both increased substantially the previous year. Other key drivers of emissions in agriculture, such as the number of dairy cows, continued to rise.
Residential: Emissions in the residential sector decreased by 7.3% (0.52 metric tonnes of CO 2 eq) in 2019 with the warmer winter resulting in decreased use of fuels. However, emissions per household have plateaued in recent years which indicates a need to step up energy efficiency retrofit activity to achieve future emission reduction commitments.
Transport: Greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector decreased slightly, by 0.3% in 2019. An increased demand for transport largely offset more biofuel use which was up 21.9% in 2019. Reducing transport emissions requires a blend of measures such as more cycling and walking as well as new technologies such as electric vehicles and biofuels.

Stephen Treacy, senior manager at the EPA, said: “Focusing on climate action as part of a ‘green’ recovery offers the opportunity to respond to climate change while rebuilding our economy and generating new jobs.”
These 2019 figures illustrate where our economy and emissions were heading before the Covid-19 pandemic. While 2020 is likely to see a reduction in emissions caused by the impact of the pandemic, this does not negate the need for long term and sustained action. 
The full detail on the Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventory 1990 to 2019 is available on the EPA website and the EPA Greenhouse Gas web resource is also available online.","But the figures also indicate that Ireland is highly unlikely to meet its overall EU targets by the end of this year.",2,0,0,7325,"Fri 6:00 AM"

The trade union agreed to call for the change at its virtual delegate conference today, as part of a “steady and managed transition to a shorter working week for all employees in the private, public and community sectors”.
Speaking to TheJournal.ie, Fórsa’s Joe O’Connor said that the Covid-19 pandemic has allowed workers to “radically” rethink the model of work. 
Citing a Fórsa survey where 75% of respondents believed a four-day week would be desirable for employees, and almost half of employers (46%) said trialing a four-day week in their own workplace was “feasible”.
O’Connor said that the four-day week was part of moving towards measuring the outcomes and results of workers, rather than “the time you spend in the office”. 
[The Covid-19 pandemic has] made workers see they can be productive in a different environment.
He said that he believed employees and employers have gone from thinking a four-day work week was a “radical” idea before the pandemic, to now thinking that it’s “reasonable”. 
He said that the National Women’s Council believe that a four-day week will help create greater gender balance in the workplace, as men will be able to take on “a greater caring role in the home”.
To succeed in achieving a four-day working week, O’Connor says that this has to come from “a combination of leadership in private sector, trade union at the centre pushing the agenda, and government”.

Von der Leyen announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) could give “conditional marketing authorisation” as early as the second half of December if development continues without any problems.
Working together, US giant Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech have developed a vaccine which the companies say has had successful clinical trials and have sent data to the EMA.
US biotech company Moderna has said its experimental vaccine is 95% effective.
The Amsterdam-based EMA will have to study test results before recommending that Brussels gives its approval, but speaking after talks with EU leaders, von der Leyen was cautiously optimistic.
The European Union has contracts to reserve hundreds of millions of doses of future vaccines with BioNTech, Purevac, AstraZeneca and Sanofi if they can be brought to market.
“And we continue negotiations with Moderna, and we are in talks with Novavax,” von der Leyen said, adding that all 27 EU leaders had voiced support for the EU buying program.
She stressed that in the case of US firms, the EMA was in daily contact with its American equivalent the FDA.
“And if all proceeds with no problems. EMA tells us that the conditional marketing authorisation for BioNTech and Moderna could happen as early as the second half of December 2020.”

“We are working at full speed,” he told AFP, confirming the companies plan to apply for emergency use authorisation of their jab in the US on Friday, while European regulators will receive another batch of data “next week”.
“There is a chance that we can receive approval from the US or Europe or both regions this year still,” said Sahin, who is also BioNTech’s chief executive.

“We may even start delivering the vaccine in December if everyone works together very closely.”
But earlier this week, Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel warned that protracted negotiations with Brussels over a contract to reserve his vaccine could delay shipments.
“It is clear that with a delay this is not going to limit the total amount but it is going to slow down delivery,” he also told AFP.
Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna have taken the lead in the global chase for a vaccine, after large-scale trial data this month showed their jabs were around 95% effective against Covid-19.
The breakthroughs have lifted hopes for an end to a pandemic that has infected more than 56 million people and caused more than 1.3 million deaths worldwide since the virus first emerged.

The opposition has already rejected this offer as insufficient, with Labour leader Alan Kelly pointing out that “she has no choice but to answer her normal PQs”.
This comes after days of requests from the opposition for the Minister to answer why and how she came to appoint Fine Gael’s former Attorney General Séamus Woulfe to the Supreme Court, the highest court in Ireland. It is understood that judges in other courts applied for the vacancy. 
Writing to the Ceann Comhairle this evening, McEntee asked for the Business Committee to “reschedule my next session of oral ministerial questions, currently due to take place on December 15, to a date that meets the satisfaction of members”.
McEntee said that the “process of oral questions will ensure that members can raise concerns across numerous issues within the parameters of normal parliamentary procedures”.
The Minister said that although she and her government colleagues have “grave concerns” about a Dáil debate on the matter, that she is “conscious of the responsibility of ministers to be accountable to the Dáil”.
The Government has argued that a Dáil discussion of how Woulfe was the preferred candidate over sitting judges, and recommended to Cabinet by McEntee, would be a breach of the separation of powers.

“The Minister for Justice and the Government must now end this charade and agree to make a statement to the Dáil on Tuesday afternoon followed by a Q&A with opposition spokespeople.
It is highly misleading for the Minister to present her request for the rescheduling of her standard Oral Question session which covers all matters under her brief as some kind of concession to the calls from the Labour Party for nearly a week now for her to answer specific questions in the Dáil on the Supreme Court appointment process.
The deadline for priority oral questions for next Tuesday was at 11am this morning.

A meeting of the executive’s parties this evening agreed that new restrictions would begin next Friday, the same day that restrictions on a number of sectors were supposed to end.
Health minister Robin Swann warned that more interventions were necessary before the end of this month to curb the spread of coronavirus.
His ultimatum to Stormont colleagues stated that if they did not take action, a full lockdown in mid-December would not be enough to prevent hospital services from being overwhelmed.
It’s reported that the new restrictions will see the closure of all non-essential retail, leisure and hospitality businesses, and churches.
However, it’s understood that schools will still be allowed to remain open under the restrictions.
Swann also asked fellow ministers to consider local travel restrictions which were legally enforceable
It comes as a five-week circuit-break lockdown in the North ends tonight, after a one-week extension to those restrictions was agreed last Wednesday night.
From tomorrow, cafes, coffee shops, hairdressers and beauticians are allowed to reopen, while pubs, hotels and restaurants had been expected to re-open next Friday.

Mann wasn’t alone in his frustration. In the nineteen-nineties, the spread of e-mail had transformed knowledge work. With nearly all friction removed from professional communication, anyone could bother anyone else at any time. Many e-mails brought obligations: to answer a question, look into a lead, arrange a meeting, or provide feedback. Work lives that had once been sequential—two or three blocks of work, broken up by meetings and phone calls—became frantic, improvisational, and impossibly overloaded. “E-mail is a ball of uncertainty that represents anxiety,” Mann said, reflecting on this period.

The 44-year-old was announced as the winner of the prize in a virtual ceremony which featured contributions from former US president Barack Obama and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.
Shuggie Bain, which is based on Stuart’s childhood, is set in Glasgow in the 1980s and tells the story of a young boy growing up with a mother who is battling addiction.
The author explores poverty, tough upbringings and alcoholism in his book.
Margaret Busby, chair of the judging panel, described the novel as “daring, frightening and life-changing”.

She added: “The heart-wrenching story tells of the unconditional love between Agnes Bain – set on a descent into alcoholism by the tough circumstances life has dealt her – and her youngest son.
Shuggie struggles with responsibilities beyond his years to save his mother from herself, at the same time as dealing with burgeoning feelings and questions about his own otherness.
“Gracefully and powerfully written, this is a novel that has impact because of its many emotional registers and its compassionately realised characters.
“The poetry in Douglas Stuart’s descriptions and the precision of his observations stand out: nothing is wasted.”
The shortlist for the £50,000 prize also featured Avni Doshi’s Burnt Sugar and Maaza Mengiste’s The Shadow King.
The New Wilderness by Diane Cook, Real Life by Brandon Taylor and Tsitsi Dangarembga’s This Mournable Body were also nominated.
Obama addressed the ceremony via a pre-recorded video message.

“I’ve always turned to writing to make sense of our world … and at their best Booker Prize-listed books remind me of fiction’s power to put ourselves in someone else’s shoes, understand their struggles, and imagine new ways to tackle complex problems and effect change,” he said.
I want to salute the work of the Booker Prize Foundation to encourage people to read more fiction and promote the art of reading for the public benefit.
Stuart is the second Scottish writer to win the award after James Kelman scooped the 1994 prize for How Late It Was, How Late.
Busby was joined on the judging panel by writers Lee Child, Sameer Rahim and Lemn Sissay, as well as classicist Emily Wilson.
Last year’s prize was jointly won by Margaret Atwood’s The Testaments and Bernardine Evaristo’s Girl, Woman, Other.

467,195,"Explainer: What is the future of fur farming in Ireland?",https://www.thejournal.ie/future-of-fur-mink-farming-ireland-5271940-Nov2020/,"EARLIER TODAY, IT was announced that all farmed minks in Ireland will be culled over the coming weeks.
This is a precautionary measure after a coronavirus variant was discovered in Danish mink farms.
Denmark, a huge exporter of mink fur, ordered a cull of all minks on 4 November over fears the mutated virus could threaten the effectiveness of any future Covid-19 vaccine for humans.  
Yesterday, Denmark’s agriculture minister Mogens Jensen resigned following criticism of his handling of the cull of the country’s 15 to 17 million minks. He said last week that this order had no legal basis. 
In Ireland, it’s understood that the Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan wrote to Agriculture Minister Charlie McConalogue to recommend the cull. 
Mink owners will be compensated in the short-term, but they will not be able to replace the animals, it is understood. The owners will receive a wider compensation package in the future. 
Let’s look ahead to the future of fur farming in Ireland and the government’s plans to end the practice over time. 
How many mink farms are in Ireland? 
There are currently three mink farms in Ireland located in Donegal, Laois and Kerry. 
Between them, the farms breed and kill around 110,000 mink a year, according to the Department of Agriculture. 
What will happen to the minks now? 
The Department of Agriculture said today it is working with public health authorities and operators of Irish mink farms to address potential coronavirus risks. 
The mink herd in Ireland has been tested for the coronavirus, but so far no positive results have been recorded.
No mink farm workers or their families have tested positive for Covid-19 either. 
The department added that the Department of Health said the continued practice of mink farming “represents an ongoing risk of additional mink-adapted SARS-CoV-2 variants emerging”. 
As a result, it recommended that all farmed mink should be culled. 
The department said it is engaging with mink farmers to “consider the next steps”. 
Are there other fur farms in Ireland? 
No, the three mink farms in operation are the only fur farms left in Ireland. The number of fur farms reduced from four to three in 2014, according to the Department of Agriculture last year. 
In 2011, a review group was set up to examine fur farming in Ireland and it did not recommend banning the industry.
The department put in more rigorous controls on fur farms in areas like animal welfare and inspections in 2012 after the group published its report. 
Other animals farmed for fur abroad include chinchillas, foxes and rabbits. 
What has the government said it will do about fur farming? 
The Cabinet in the previous government agreed in June 2019 to phase out fur farming in Ireland. 
The Programme For Government outlines that the current government will “immediately prioritise” the drafting of legislation to phase out fur farming. It said legislation in this area would be published “as soon as possible”. 
The Prohibition of Fur Farming Bill 2018 was put forward by TDs Ruth Coppinger, Paul Murphy and Mick Barry. It got to the first stage in the Dáil but lapsed with the dissolution of the previous government earlier this year. 
A new Bill has not yet been put forward by the current government, but Minister Charlie McConalogue said on Tuesday that his department will begin to prepare a Bill “in due course”. 
He said the Bill will “provide for the phased introduction of a ban on fur farming which will include a prohibition on mink farming”. 
McConalogue responded in writing to TD Mick Barry on this issue in the Dáil.
“The Bill will make it illegal for any new fur farms to be established and will put in place phase out arrangements for the small number of current operators,” McConalogue wrote.

Testing of animals on the three mink farms in Ireland was initiated earlier this month, but as of today all results received were negative.
Independent TD Michael Fitzmaurice has called for wild mink to be included in the cull. There are up to 33,500 wild mink in Ireland, according to a 2009 government review.
“If a cull is to take place on the three mink farms in Ireland, then we must take the opportunity to eradicate the mink in the wild,” Fitzmaurice said in a statement. 
The wild mink in Ireland became established after escaping or being released from farms decades ago. They are a scourge on the countryside, particularly when it comes to lambs and native birds.
What is the situation in other countries, like Denmark?
Fur farming is banned in many European countries like Belgium and Croatia. Fur farming has also been banned in the UK (including in Northern Ireland) since the early 2000s. 
Mink farming is a huge industry in Denmark, with three times more mink in the country than people. 
Denmark sells around €670 million worth of mink fur each year and is the world’s second-biggest producer behind China. 
Despite the fears over the mink-associated coronavirus strain, the Danish health ministry said today that the mutated version has likely been eradicated. 
The ministry said in a statement that there had been no new cases of the ‘cluster 5′ mink mutation since 15 September, leading the Danish infectious disease authority to conclude it has been eradicated. 
Scientists have said that it’s not unusual for viruses to mutate and the process rarely poses an additional threat.
But the strain known as ‘cluster 5′ could be less susceptible to human antibodies, initial Danish studies showed.
“If these new SARS-CoV-2 variants, with lower susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies, spread widely in the population it could potentially affect the level of overall vaccine effectiveness,” the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said.
But the agency highlighted that there is “high uncertainty” about the actual level of danger and “further investigations are required regarding the nature of these mutations”.
‘Cluster 5′ is one of five coronavirus mutations detected among mink, but the others are not seen as problematic.

A Cabinet Office investigation was launched in March over allegations that Patel belittled colleagues and clashed with senior officials in three different departments.
Sir Philip Rutnam, who was the Home Office’s permanent secretary, quit earlier this year, accusing Patel of a “vicious and orchestrated briefing campaign” against him.
Rutman is claiming constructive dismissal at an employment tribunal, but Patel has expressed concern at the “false” claims and allies have described her as a “demanding” boss but not a bully.
The report has yet to be concluded, and reports emerged this week that Prime Minister Boris Johnson could only issue Patel with a written warning, rather than dismissing her from the Cabinet.
This evening, Sky News reports that the report found Patel broke the code governing ministers’ conduct by failing to treat staff with consideration and respect.
It’s also reported that the investigation is critical of Patel’s behaviour and that the report will call for the Home Secretary to make a formal apology.
Earlier, Labour called reports that the Patel would be issued with a warning as “incredibly serious”.

The Financial Times has cited sources earlier which said Johnson was intending to “fudge” the outcome of the report which has “robust criticisms” of Patel’s behaviour.
Dave Penman of the senior civil servants’ union the FDA said that if the reports were true, then the Prime Minister should have no choice but to conclude that the code has been breached.
He added that Johnson should publish the report and introduce a new independent complaints system.

Patricia Treacy, from Blackrock in Co Louth said she felt both “honoured and privileged” to have been invited to play at the event.
The invitation came directly to her from the Biden family yesterday, after Treacy played for the then vice president when he visited his ancestral home in Louth in 2016.
She also revealed that one of America’s most famous jewellers will dress her in diamonds for the event.
“It always brings me a great sense of pride to be able to represent Ireland,” Treacy said.
“My first thought was to share the news with my mother, who I owe my talent to, as she was my inspiration with an amazing singing voice and musical talents of her own.”
Treacy has performed for Biden on a number of occasions, including in March 2016 when she played at his official residence.
“President-elect Biden, because of his Irish roots, is very much into celebrating St Patrick’s Day, and I had the honour of performing for his invited dignitaries during his annual Irish celebration gathering which included our then Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, and his wife,” she recalled.
She has also performed at Biden rallies in Chicago and other cities.
Treacy shared the news with friends including the former chairwoman of the Kennedy Centre Board to the performing arts in Washington Kelly Katz, who along with her husband are famous jewellers in Hollywood.
The couple have a long history of providing the stars with diamonds and luxury jewels for the Oscars, the Grammys and other high profile events.

The HSE is currently meeting with stakeholders to discuss the issue and hope to deliver updated guidelines next week.
Dr Colm Henry, the Chief Operations Officer and a member of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), said that “regardless of the level” of restrictions, they would find a way to facilitate Christmas visits.
He told a HSE briefing: “It’s clear now the impact this is having on a particularly vulnerable population, for whom visits from loved ones and family members, that’s the most important part of their lives.
And from which they might suffer a great deal in its absence. So, this has been discussed, we’re looking at ways… There is a provision if you look at the guidelines of exceptions made for compassionate reasons.
He said an interpretation of those guidelines is currently being looked at. Dr Henry believes it can be achieved safely.
He said: “Now we have improved awareness, improved infection control measures thanks to all those teams working throughout nursing homes, I think it is timely for us to look at that compassionate provision for level three to level five.
So that, for Christmas, regardless of the level, that we find some way to facilitate visitors to older people in nursing home settings.
Professor Martin Cormican, the HSE’s clinical lead for antimicrobial resistance and infection control, said exceptions can still be made under the current guidelines.
He said: “Even as the guidance exists now, sometimes people think compassionate means for people who are approaching the end of life.
“But actually we’ve defined compassionate on critical grounds in the guidance and it’s much broader than that.
“Compassionate would also cover situations where a person is experiencing significant psychological distress due to isolation.
It takes account of the needs of a person as a whole. It’s not just about end of life. We’re looking at how we might clarify that, particularly around needs in relation to Christmas.

Speaking in the Dáil today, Murphy called for a change in government policy when it comes to handling the Covid-19 crisis. 
His comments come a day after the Taoiseach confirmed to his party that a Dáil debate will take place on Tuesday in relation to how the government proceeds in lifting Level 5 restrictions.
A final decision from government is due by the end of next week, after the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) meet on Thursday.
Tensions are once again rising among members of NPHET and senior government officials. 
While it is not the first time, there is growing sense is some government circles that the words of NPHET is confusing the messaging, and shifting power towards the public health team.
Throughout this pandemic, there have been concerns in the background in relation to public health experts pronouncing what should be done on the national airwaves, when policy, and the advice given to the public, should ultimately be coming from government. 
Just one week out from the lifting of Level 5 restrictions, pressure is on the Taoiseach to ensure Christmas can be meaningful for people, while also balancing the public health aspect.
Pressure has also been mounting on Micheál Martin to set out that the country will not return to another lockdown after Christmas.
Addressing the issue today, Murphy said people “despaired at the thought of Level 5 for six weeks”.
“They look forward to it being lifted… but they know they are not going to enjoy the Christmas period because the threat of another lockdown will be hanging over them for the entire month,” he said.
“As people go about meeting family and friends, and enjoying the festive season, all they will see is the likelihood of another lockdown increasing,” said the Dublin Bay South TD.
Change in policy
The Fine Gael TD called for a change of government policy, stating that “a change in policy is not to admit a policy is wrong, it is just to admit that things have changed, and they have changed”.

He called for a “no lockdown strategy” to be announced by the Taoiseach next week, stating there are other ways now to keep people safe while living with the virus.

He said personal behaviour will be important over the festive period, and a level of trust will be placed on the public stay safe. 
Reopening after Level 5
Speaking to Newstalk Breakfast, Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said the government has a critical decision to make in the next week. He said people should be allowed to return to work, perhaps one day per week.

He said: “What we need to do as we return now is to promote the controlled environments, that includes the reopening of retail.

GARDAÍ ARE INVESTIGATING the uploading of images and videos of Irish women and girls, without their consent, to a number of online forums.
It is understood that some of the images and footage are of minors. A number of TDs called for action on this issue in the Dáil today.
The Victims Alliance, an advocacy group, said tens of thousands of images have been shared on various online platforms.
The group is working to identify the victims but said many of them are Irish.
Linda Hayden, who co-founded the Victims Alliance, said members of the group forwarded the files or folders marked as ‘minors’ to An Garda Síochána.
Many of the images have been shared in forums on Discord, an online messaging platform.
At least one forum on the website where users were sharing images has been removed, Hayden said. The forum in question had about 500 users, all of whom were banned from the website.
The first server was initially deleted by its owners, along with all the photos on it, once it started attracting attention online. A second server was then set up as a replacement for the original server.
A spokesperson for Discord told TheJournal.ie that as soon as the website “became aware of this server, we permanently deleted it” and “identified and banned the approximately 500 users involved”.
“We deleted it and banned its users before they could upload pictures again. We continue to monitor proactively for any new attempt to recreate a server.”
The spokesperson said the company “will cooperate on this matter with Irish authorities subject to applicable law”.
“No one should have to endure the pain of having private images posted online without their consent.
“Discord has a zero-tolerance approach to nonconsensual pornography and child sexual abuse material, and we work aggressively and proactively to keep it off of our service,” they added.
Conversations between users on Discord are private, but not end-to-end encrypted so administrators can view the content if inappropriate behaviour is reported.
Images of females have also been uploaded to pornography sites without their consent.
Hayden spoke to gardaí about the issue yesterday.
A Garda spokesperson confirmed to TheJournal.ie that AGS is “aware of the reports and Assistant Commissioner (Organised & Serious Crime) has commenced probative enquires into the matter”.
Hayden said some of the images and videos in question were taken by the victims and privately shared but were later publicly shared without their consent or knowledge.
Some images or footage were taken of people surreptitiously and without their knowledge, and others were taken from online platforms such as OnlyFans, Tinder, WhatsApp and Instagram.
Hayden said she is very worried about the mental health impact of the situation on the victims, and the group is providing support to those who need it.
Comments on one of the forums
Comments on one of the forums
The sharing of intimate or explicit images of a person without their consent is typically referred to as ‘revenge porn’, or image-based sexual abuse, and is usually done by an ex-partner. It is not currently an offence in Ireland.
Over 25,000 people have to date signed a petition calling for this type of abuse to be made a criminal offence.
Any images of, or depicting, a person under the age of 18 engaging in sexual activity is considered child sexual abuse material under the 1998 Child Trafficking and Pornography Act.
‘Pic-swapping culture’
Ciaran O’Connor, a researcher and investigator with the Institute for Strategic Dialogue in London, said there is a “pretty active ‘pic-swapping’ culture” in some online groups.
“Someone will download a cache of photos and then they’ll trade photos of person A in exchange for pics of person B that someone else says they have, and they build up repositories of photos.”
O’Connor explained that while the photos or videos are often of women or girls the posters know, sometimes they share images of celebrities or people who have a high-profile online.
“It’s pretty nasty and tough to tackle because these platforms are built around varying levels of anonymity for these users.”
Rape Crisis Network Ireland has condemned “in the strongest possible way” people who have shared or downloaded images of this nature without consent.
“If you have access to someone else’s image that has been shared online and you are concerned it has been shared without their consent, it is vital that you refer the matter to the gardaí and refrain from any further sharing or action around the image,” a spokesperson said.
‘Victim blaming’
Holly Cairns said Justice Minister Helen McEntee needs to bring forward legislation as a matter of urgency.
The Social Democrats TD is calling on McEntee to “move immediately to protect victims of what we all know is a crime but today is still not considered one”.
Cairns told TheJournal.ie any “victim blaming” in relation to the issue should not be tolerated.
“I want to send a clear message to anyone whose images have been shared without their consent.
It’s not your fault. You didn’t do anything wrong. You’re not to blame. Unfortunately, the law isn’t protecting you and it’s not your fault, and that has to change.
Cairns said people in Ireland “need to have an incredibly serious and difficult national conversation on this and related issues”.
“Thousands of Irish men are sharing images of women and girls without their consent, there are horrific levels of sexual violence in our colleges, we all know victims of domestic abuse or sexual assault.”
Cairns added that any men who “see or receive an image being circulated without consent, to call it out”.
“You should speak up, in WhatsApp groups, in conversation, in any given situation – you need to call it out. If you don’t you are complicit.”
Cairns was among those to raise the issue in the Dáil today.

‘The action of degenerates’
Fine Gael TD Neale Richmond said sharing intimate images without consent is “absolutely abhorrent” and “needs to end”.
He told the Dáil men need to call out this type of behaviour. “You are sharing the personal, private details of a friend or someone’s sister or daughter.”
Labour’s Duncan Smith added: “If men think this acceptable, nothing could be further from the truth. It is the action of degenerates, it is scummy, it’s the most indecent act one human can inflict on another.”
Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said the use of sexual images “to get revenge on somebody is heinous and disgusting”. He said he would discuss the issue with McEntee.
The Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL) has also called for urgent action on image-based sexual abuse.
The ICCL said it is “deeply troubled” by the fact tens of thousands of images and videos were published online without people’s consent.
“The creation and/or distribution of private sexual images without consent is not revenge porn, it’s image-based sexual abuse,” a spokesperson said.
“However, our laws need to be updated to ensure victims of such abuse can get justice.
“New legislation should ensure that victims’ experiences are taken into account and must encompass definitions of consent and intent that reflect the sexual nature of this crime.”
The issue is covered in the Harassment, Harmful Communications, and Related Offences Bill. The legislation was first proposed by Labour in May 2017, but it was not passed prior to the dissolution of the last government.
A spokesperson for the Department of Justice for comment said the Bill “is being progressed as a priority”.
“Harassment and abuse in any form, whether online or otherwise, is utterly unacceptable and has no place in Irish society,” McEntee said in a statement.
“The standards of what is unacceptable in an online setting must be consistent with those in traditional settings, and cross government initiatives are underway to address this.”
The minister added that she is committed to seeing the legislation “enacted as quickly as possible”.
The Bill will be brought before the Justice Committee on 1 December. After the Bill is debated in the Dáil, it will go before the Seanad.
The legislation, if passed, could see offenders sentenced to up to seven years in prison.

477,228,"FactCheck: No, a German city has not ruled that compulsory mask-wearing is illegal",https://www.thejournal.ie/factcheck-mask-mandate-dusseldorf-germany-5270644-Nov2020/,"A CLAIM SHARED widely on social media in Ireland in recent days has suggested that a German city has said that compulsory mask-wearing is not legal after a court ruled that masks posed a danger to health. 
The claim, which gained traction in Ireland three days ago, suggests that a blanket ban has been placed on any rule requiring mask-wearing in the German city of Düsseldorf.
In fact, requirements to wear a mask in almost all social settings in the city remain in place. The guidance on mask-wearing in Düsseldorf has been updated slightly since a recent court finding that the rules needed to be more specific, but not because of any danger from masks. 
The Claim
The claim that mandatory mask-wearing was outlawed in Düsseldorf has spread widely in recent days.
The most common version of the post shares a screenshot of a tweet that states a court in Germany had accepted that “mask-wearing results in oxygen deprivation and brain damage after just two hours” and that the “mask mandate in Dusseldorf is now declared illegal”. 
One post on an Irish Facebook page sharing the claim has received 353 reactions, 97 comments, and has been shared 218 times.
Another has been reacted to 128 times, commented on 9 times, and shared 176 times, and a third has received 49 reactions, 14 comments, and 110 shares.
One post sharing the claim on Facebook said that the “mask mandate [was] made illegal in Germany after it was proved they are detrimental to health”. The post has received 111 reactions and 44 comments, and has been shared 272 times.
The Evidence
Düsseldorf has not lifted its requirement for people to wear masks in specific public settings.
The city issued a decree on Wednesday 4 November that required masks to be worn across the entire city area, in addition to guidance on mask-wearing that had been in place since April which called for masks in most indoor public settings.
The new additional rule would have expanded compulsory mask-wearing to pedestrians and any other path users, and the only exception would have been in non-built up areas, such as green spaces.
On 10 November, the Düsseldorf Administrative Court found that the new rule on wearing a mask throughout the city was too general to comply with the legal principle of certainty, which requires laws to be clear enough for people to know how to follow them.
This means that the court found the rule was not detailed enough in specifying where or when masks would need to be worn to ensure that people would be able to understand how to comply with it.
In response, the guidance in Düsseldorf was updated the next day to address the court’s decision. The requirement to wear a mask in the city area now applies specifically to urban areas that are visited by a large number of people at the same time, including:
Streets with a significant number of retail shops between 10am and 7pm
The squares in front of and behind the main train/underground station in Düsseldorf between 6am and 10pm
The areas in front and behind of Düsseldorf's main train station, where pedestrians are required to wear masks between 6am and 10pm. The rule is in addition to guidance about mask-wearing in other social settings.
Source: Düsseldorf City portal
Düsseldorf is following the Covid-19 guidelines in place in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, which covers cities in the northwest of Germany.
Across the North-Rhine Westphalia state, current guidance requires that masks are worn in closed rooms in public spaces; on public transport; during close-contact services or training activities, such as in medical practices and in the healthcare sector; in public city buildings, schools, and day-care centers; educational events in closed rooms; meetings, assemblies and events in closed rooms; and in playgrounds.
Exceptions to the mask requirement are in place for children up to school entry; people who have a medical exemption; teachers, if social distancing can be observed; and rescue services, security authorities, fire brigades, and disaster control in emergency situations.
Additionally, people are allowed to temporarily remove their mask for specific reasons, such as to communicate with a Deaf person or to eat and drink on long-distance trains. In a work setting, it is permitted to use protective measures such as glass partitions instead of masks for employees.
Between 3 March and 18 November, 8,810 Dusseldorf residents have been diagnosed with Covid-19, with 1,035 currently infected. The city’s Covid-19 restrictions and guidelines, including mask-wearing, are in place in a bid to curb the spread of the virus.
It can be seen that the court’s ruling on the city’s recent addition to its guidelines, which has since been updated, related to the specificity of the rule.
Despite this, social media users have claimed that the court found there was a risk to people’s health from masks, which is not true.
 The summary of the case as published by the court makes no reference to any discussion of dangers posed by masks. Instead, the focus is on the lack of specificity in the decree that the city brought in.

This is not to say that dangers from masks, either real or imagined, may not have been mentioned at any stage during the hearing.
However, this was not included in the court’s findings and did not form part of its decision-making, in contrast to the claims that have been made on social media.
A variety of false claims have been made during the Covid-19 pandemic arguing that masks can cause various risks to health, many of which TheJournal.ie has already debunked.
One false claim that has repeatedly surfaced on social media is that Legionnaires’ disease, a type of pneumonia that can cause serious illness in people over 50, smokers, or people with underlying health conditions, can be caused by mask-wearing.
However, the HSE has said that Legionnaire’s disease cannot be contracted by wearing a mask and that infections with Legionnaire’s have been lower in Ireland this year compared to 2019.
Other claims about health risks from masks – that they disrupt pH levels and increase cancer risk, that they cause flu-like symptoms, or that they reduce oxygen intake - are also false and have been debunked.
The Verdict
Düsseldorf, in line with many cities in Germany and around the world, introduced a requirement to wear a face covering in certain social settings earlier in the Covid-19 pandemic. That requirement remains in place.
Earlier this month, the city introduced an additional rule that masks were to be worn across the entire city area by pedestrians and any other road users on paths.
The Düsseldorf Administrative Court found that the rule was too general to comply with the legal principle of certainty. Instead, following the court’s finding, the rule will apply specifically to urban areas with high foot traffic at certain times, including in popular retail spots and near the main train station.
The court’s finding did not relate to any supposed risk to health posed by masks. A variety of false claims suggesting that masks have adverse health effects have already been proven to be untrue.
As a result, we rate the claim that a German court banned mandatory masks because of a risk to health: FALSE. As per our verdict guide, this means: The claim is inaccurate.

478,226,"'There was real animosity there... there would have been a want to silence him'",https://www.the42.ie/sherry-lowe-the42-rugby-weekly-5272076-Nov2020/,"Updated Thu 5:03 PM
JAMES LOWE IS a very popular figure with those he has played with and those who know him personally, but he tends to be top of the head-hunting list for opposition teams.
The new Ireland wing is a spiky presence on the field, as underlined once again on his Test debut against Wales last weekend. 
Speaking on today’s episode of The42 Rugby Weekly, former Munster hooker Mike Sherry explained how the province’s players would have had to shed a bit of a grudge towards Lowe when he came into Ireland camp this autumn.
Leinster man Lowe has been involved in a few skirmishes with Munster over the last three years, meaning he had become a bit of a target in their inter-provincial clashes. 
Host Gavan Casey put the question to Sherry:
“When I heard that some of the Munster players had warmed to him during Ireland camp and realised he’s actually not so bad, I thought it was a joke.
“I didn’t realise there would be actual, real disdain there, despite the fact that he would be sticking the knife in during games for Leinster against Munster. I always thought that was a bit performative and that once the full-time whistle blew, it’s not genuine hatred.
“But all the sounds since that have been that there was actual animosity from Munster players towards him?”
Sherry, who retired from playing rugby last year at the age of 31, explained that there had been a real edge between Munster and Lowe. 
“There was definitely real animosity there,” said Sherry. “If you think of it from their point of view, they’re going to play Leinster in semi-final after semi-final and it’s invariably going Leinster’s way with the odd Munster scalp during the season. When it comes to semi-finals, it has not gone Munster’s way for a long time.
Lowe made his Ireland debut last week against Wales.

“So the hostilities have lessened from both sides because of Irish camp and getting to know the players that way, whereas Lowe wasn’t in Irish camp. The Munster players just saw him when he was running amok, scoring tries, getting involved in the niggly stuff, and they didn’t get a chance to know him as the guy he is.
“So there would have been real animosity and, being honest, jealously that he was doing so well and having such an impact on these games.
“Look back on the Felipe Contepomi, ROG, Donncha O’Callaghan, Denis Leamy, that rivalry, they never got to know Contepomi. I’m sure they have since but they didn’t get to know him by being in Ireland camp obviously, he was away with Argentina and there was also that rivalry internationally.
“So it would have been real [with Lowe], there would have been a want to silence him. Unfortunately, there’s not really that much interaction after games, you have your meals and you’re back onto your bus to your own city.
“They wouldn’t have got to know him and I can assure you that was real. It’s good to see that that has lessened as they’ve got to know him!”

Indeed, Lowe swiftly won over the Munster players when he was called into Ireland camp and made an impressive debut against Wales last Friday.
The 28-year-old starts against England this Saturday and Sherry believes he is a brilliant addition for Ireland.
“He brings a huge amount, he’s infectious in his personality and how he plays. He adds a real touch of class, he’s a momentum-giver.
“He’s incredibly strong as you can see in his carries and tackles, everything he does has a real venom in it, there’s a real decisiveness whenever he gets the ball. He brings a different element to the back three, he’s not your typical Irish player, obviously.
Lowe will start against England on Saturday.

“He’s bringing that x-factor that maybe sometimes might be missing. He’s such a consistent performer, something that’s not really touched on, but it’s rare that he’s not a focal figure in any game he has played for Leinster, he’s at the heart of everything.
“Even when the ball isn’t coming his way, he’ll get involved in some little scrap and smiling in the oppositions’ face. I’m sure he’s absolutely hated across the league by the opposition but his team-mates absolutely love him.
“If you play with him, train with him, and are around him, he seems like a lovely guy and really infectious in everything he does. It’s a huge boost to the squad. You’ve seen the impact he has had on Leinster and he’s good enough to have that impact for Ireland.”
This week’s episode of The42 Rugby Weekly saw Sherry joining Gavan Casey and Murray Kinsella to discuss Ireland’s new halfback pairing, Andy Farrell’s much-changed XV, as well as the English power and kicking game.
They also chatted about Dan Leavy’s form with Leinster, some promising Munster performances, and the competitiveness of the Pro14 early on this season.

The man attempted to sue his employer at the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), whose adjudication officer Emile Daly dismissed his claim after finding that the decision was reasonable and proportionate.
The incident leading to his dismissal followed a staff Christmas party in December 2018, when the man’s female work colleague alleged that she was sexually assaulted in a hotel room after the event.
The man was suspended pending an investigation into the matter, and the beverage company hired an independent investigator to carry out an investigation.
The investigator’s findings found that based on the balance of probabilities, the man had sexually assaulted his female work colleague.
The man was subsequently fired for gross misconduct on 5 May, 2019.
In her findings, Daly agreed that the findings reached by the independent investigator were well-founded.
She also explained that she was satisfied that the decision to dismiss the man was within a band of reasonable sanctions that could have been applied by the employer.
“I do not accept that the sanction of dismissal was disproportionate to the findings of the investigator,” she said.
“A sexual assault is a serious finding and one that is capable of being considered as an act of gross misconduct.”
The man claimed at the WRC that the investigator’s findings were flawed, claiming they failed to take account of the possibility that the encounter was consensual and that witnesses who could have discredited his female colleague’s testimony had not been interviewed.
The man also claimed that the dismissal was unfair because the alleged event took place in a private hotel room which was not within the workplace.
The beverage firm told the WRC that the man did not participate in the investigation in any material way and when asked questions by the investigator, he replied that under legal advice, he would not answer any questions.
In her findings, Daly found that the alleged assault took place within the employment of the dismissed man.

She reasoned that the Christmas party had been organised and hosted by the man’s employer at a venue chosen by the company.
“The parties would not have been at the venue but for the Christmas party,” she concluded.
Daly also stated that the man’s failure to provide his version of events left the investigator with no option other than to make the findings that she did.
“It may be that he was advised against the risk of self-incrimination, lest a criminal investigation be commenced at a later date, this remains unknown,” she said.

481,183,"Teaching union said it never proposed breaking early for Christmas",https://www.thejournal.ie/school-closures-2-5272298-Nov2020/,"Updated Thu 4:35 PM
THE TEACHERS’ UNION of Ireland (TUI) has said that it never proposed the idea of schools closing early for the Christmas break. 
Speaking before the Oireachtas Education Committee today, the union’s general secretary Michael Gillespie said that the idea was first mooted by politicians and that there was a petition about it but that the union was not advocating for it. 
The idea was raised in recent days to close schools for the Christmas break on Friday 18 December rather than on Tuesday 22 December, with the TUI saying that it would be a “once-off measure”. 
Speaking today, Gillespie distanced the union from the proposal. 
“We were responding to queries that came in, I think it was raised initially by a political party here, and then there was a massive petition about it,” he said. 
The TUI’s response was that it merited consideration. We never demanded it or proposed it, what seems to be what people had been quoting. So we answered press queries and we said it merited consideration.
“And the reason we said in merited consideration is that that Monday and Tuesday are not high educational days,” Gillespie added.
They would be days that traditionally would have had a lot of things going on on the hidden curriculum, things like shows, perhaps religious ceremonies, depending on the school. 
The union official said that some of the union’s own members were “upset” by the proposal but that others said it bore consideration. The TUI, he said, “went no further than that”. 
Cold weather

The committee also said that some schools could be forced to close over the winter months if the weather gets too cold due to ventilation and heating issues.
Kieran Christie, general secretary of the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland (ASTI), said teachers and students have been wearing their coats in class to stay warm since the colder weather began.
He said that hygiene and ventilation facilities need to be upgraded, and the union “remained concerned” over the differential capacity of schools to implement key aspects of the Covid-19 response plan.
“As the colder weather has set in, keeping many classrooms warm, ensuring they will be appropriately ventilated, has been a big problem in schools,” he said.
Teachers and students are there in their coats in many instances. If a period of cold weather comes in the coming weeks or months, many schools are likely to have to close for the duration.
He also said there is a lack of communication protocols in place in schools where an outbreak of Covid-19 occurs, which needs to be addressed, and he added prioritising schools for rapid testing and tracing is also needed.
Christie was one of four representatives from teachers and other school workers’ trade unions who appeared before the Education Committee on Thursday to discuss the issues affecting schools during the pandemic.
Gillespie also said many second-level school buildings are “not fit for purpose”.
He called for a full audit of each school to establish and quantify the resources needed to keep them open.
“TUI is calling for the Department of Education to take the advice of the HPSC (Health Protection Surveillance Centre) and install air quality meters in every classroom – this will ensure that student and teachers are not forced to teach and learn in freezing cold classrooms,” he said.
In the medium-term, and to future-proof our education system, we must re-conceptualise school design. The current crisis has demonstrated the importance of infrastructure that is fit for purpose.
The committee was also told that teachers should be given priority for the Covid-19 vaccine when it becomes available.

Irish National Teachers’ Organisation (INTO) general secretary John Boyle said the government should have been provided a free flu vaccine to all teachers, and the union “insist” that when a Covid-19 vaccine becomes available, all those who work in schools are “prioritised”.
He also said the government must send a strong message to families who travel abroad over Christmas that children will have to restrict their movements when they return in January in line with public health advice prior to going back to school.
High-risk
TDs and senators also heard calls from the unions for the government to undertake a further review of the requirement for high-risk teachers to attend schools during the pandemic.
Christie said he was “dismayed” that pregnant teachers and other vulnerable staff and students are being required to attend class.
“In every school there are teachers and students who are vulnerable in terms of their health status or particular personal circumstances, including pregnancy,” he said.
The ASTI is dismayed that many of these members have been required to attend schools and no remote or reasonable accommodations have been implemented to allow them to participate in their work or studies in a more appropriate setting.
“Teachers are essential workers in the education system. It is essential that schools are safe spaces for teachers and students: health, safety and welfare must be the priority of school management and the Department of Education and Skills.”

Deputy Commissioner of Policing and Security John Twomey said it has been disappointing for gardaí to witness breaches of the regulations under Level 5, but he added that he was encouraged by the overall public support for the regulations.

The report, released today by the European rights body’s anti-torture committee, found that the conditions of detention in which migrants were held in facilities in the Evros region and on the island of Samos could amount to inhuman and degrading treatment.
During an ad hoc visit to Greece in March, the committee found that migrants were held in overcrowded detention centres with poor ventilation, broken toilets and insufficient cleaning materials.
The situation was exacerbated by inadequate food supplies and no access to outdoor daily exercise. Migrants were also not provided with clear information about their situation.
The anti-torture committee said that families, unaccompanied children and other vulnerable persons – including pregnant women and people with physical or mental health illnesses – were being detained in “appalling conditions with no appropriate support”.
The report also highlights that the watchdog again received consistent and credible allegations of migrants being pushed back across the border to Turkey. It urged Greek authorities to prevent such pushbacks.

Concerns were also raised about the Greek Coast Guard preventing boats carrying migrants from reaching any Greek island and it refers to a number of allegations by migrants that they had been ill treated by members of the police and the Coast Guard.
The committee called upon Greek authorities to take vigorous steps to stamp out ill-treatment of detained migrants by the police. It also called for an end to the detention of families and unaccompanied children in police establishments. 
Greece’s national police service said that the alleged practice of pushbacks to Turkey is unsubstantiated and completely wrong.

The fast-food franchise in Spawell said the incident is being investigated following a complaint by the couple.
They said they were told to “move on” when they tried to order at the window by writing what they wanted on a piece of paper.
“I hope no one has to go through the experience I’ve had to go through,” the woman told TheJournal.ie.
“We have been there several times, twice since the beginning of Covid. We would normally show a piece of paper at the window with our order and they would process it with no problem at all.”
She said when they tried to order at the drive-thru window last night an employee approached them “and would not serve us, told us to move on as she had orders waiting”.
In a video showing part of the incident, widely shared on Facebook, the couple is seen holding up a piece of paper with their order to the worker who tells them: “we are too busy to take the order through the window”. 
The couple claimed there was just one car behind them in the drive-thru at the time “which built up to two or three” by the time they had moved on.

485,219,"Are Ireland ‘soft’? Do they still belong in the world's elite? Saturday will tell us",https://www.the42.ie/ireland-england-3-5271952-Nov2020/,"Updated Thu 2:59 PM
LAS VEGAS IS a sordid, tawdry town, home to cheap suits, blinding lights and in February 1989, the greatest line in the history of sports broadcasting.
As a sceptical American audience listened to Frank Bruno’s attempt to convince the world he had the tools to defeat Mike Tyson, HBO’s boxing commentator, Jim Lampley delivered a verbal assault, days before Iron Mike’s physical follow up.
“Bruno has the body of a Greek God ….. and the chin of a poet laureate,” Lampley announced live on air, the putdown prior to the knockdown. As it happened, Bruno fought the fight of his life, winning respect if not the match, as the violence came to an end in the fifth. “At least now people can see I’m not soft,” the Englishman said afterwards. The emotional bruises took longer to heal than the physical ones.
From Las Vegas ’89 we turn our eyes to Twickenham this weekend and while the setting will be quieter, the stakes lower, the theme of dented pride has nonetheless crossed both sporting and geographic borders.
“This lot (Wales) are not soft like Ireland,” Rassie Erasmus was heard to say in the recent documentary about the Springboks’ successful World Cup. It’s the rugby equivalent of the slur Bruno had to listen to in a tacky hotel press room 31 years ago.
Here is another harsh assessment, this one delivered by Sean O’Brien in his recent interview with The42. “In the opening game of the 2019 Six Nations championship England absolutely bullied us. That shouldn’t happen, not when it is Ireland v England.”

But it did happen and worse still, we have seen repeat showings since – in the World Cup warm-up last year and then in February’s Six Nations clash at Twickenham.

Saturday, accordingly, takes on a weighty significance, not just in terms of offering a group of players the chance to answer Erasmus’ insult but also to prove they still belong among the elite.
Many doubt they do. After a four-year residency in that company from 2014 through to 2018, winning Six Nations titles in three of those seasons, beating New Zealand, South Africa, Australia and England in the other years, their status has been downgraded.
If you can’t beat them, you can’t join them. And since November 2018, Ireland haven’t done it against the elite.
Yes, there have been three wins over Scotland but context is required; Scotland haven’t finished higher than third in the Six Nations championship and have failed to make it out of their pool in two of the last three World Cups.
Never mind, you can point to four Irish victories out of their last five games against Wales but in the one that mattered most, the 2019 Six Nations decider, Wales had it wrapped up by half-time.
More to the point, the difference between Warren Gatland’s Wales and Wayne Pivac’s version (seven games played, six lost) is similar to the contrasting value of getting a result over Alex Ferguson’s Manchester United and David Moyes’ subsequent model.
They and France have flipped. Whereas a win over Fabien Galthie’s 2020 France is significant; getting one over Jacqus Brunel’s 2019 team was a bit like beating Liverpool in Brendan Rodgers’ final season before Jurgen Klopp came in. Sure enough, Ireland won the 2019 encounter but lost out a month ago, after France rediscovered how to be good.

Now thoughts turn to England, the team that triggered this downturn in February 2019, when they won the physical battle. They did so again last August – and again in February. Each time, Ireland couldn’t come up with an answer.
It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that Farrell may remind them of this between now and kick-off. If his tactics sheet contained just three words – Erasmus’ claim that ‘Ireland are soft’ – you’d imagine that should be enough.

Again, the mind drifts back to a press conference room, this one in Melbourne in June 2018. Ireland had lost the first test of a three-game series to Australia, an excusable defeat at the end of a lengthy season – but not as far as Farrell was concerned. “Tiredness doesn’t come into it,” he animatedly said. “So, I really want to see what the famous old Irish ticker is made of this weekend.”
He’ll want to see more than mere heart this Saturday. Having played well in patches of their big games in 2018 and 2019, it’s high time this side reminded everyone of their ability to put together an 80-minute performance.
It can happen. England, after the Barbarians fiasco, have hardly had a taxing lead-in – Italy away, Georgia at home, whereas Farrell’s Ireland have been properly road-tested,  providing them with a better chance than people are prepared to admit.
If they’re to produce an upset, though, then they need to break even in the collisions and sort out the defensive issues that have seen them concede 113 points from their last three meetings against the English and 35 on last month’s trip to Paris.
What helps is the ballsy team selection. Opting for Quinn Roux rather than an undercooked Iain Henderson is untypical of modern-day Irish coaches, where the unheralded form player gets the nod over the one with a reputation.
Quinn Roux's selection ahead of Henderson is justified.
Source: Dan Sheridan/INPHO
Right across the pitch, there are guys with points to prove; eight of the starting XV having 13 caps or fewer to their name; old-timers like Pete O’Mahony and Keith Earls afforded the opportunity to remind their coach they have an international future not just a past.
Most intriguingly of all, for the first time since what seems like the Ice Age, we will see an Irish half-back pairing minus the names Sexton and Murray for a big Test, something the public has been crying out for since the last World Cup, Sexton being 35, Murray 31.
Well, if it goes badly for Jamison Gibson-Park and Ross Byrne on Saturday then the players who are supposedly over the hill will be called back up it quicker than the Grand Old Duke of York issued his orders to his 10’000 men.
But if it goes right, if there is an unexpected Irish victory, there’ll be a chance to also win a tournament, something that may carry more meaning in years to come than it does now.  
Irrespective of the fact the Autumn Nations Cup has not caught the public’s imagination yet, you have to remember this is often the way with new competitions. Few now recall that a quarter of the teams in the inaugural Heineken Cup were from Romania and Italy – but it doesn’t stop Toulouse asking tailors to stitch a fourth star onto their jerseys.
Nor do too many Uruguayans mention that the first FIFA World Cup, which they won, contained just four European sides. Ninety years on, they remain one of only eight countries to have lifted that trophy.
Of course we’re not suggesting the Autumn Nations Cup will grow anywhere near as big as that – it may never even obtain the prestige of the Heineken Cup – but when you have a history of just 14 outright tournament wins from 135 entries (to Home/Five/Six Nations and World Cups), you can’t afford to be snobby about any silverware.
Like it or not the Nations Cup is here to stay. It will get bigger. New Zealand, Australia and South Africa will sign up in the post Covid world. It’ll be a prize worth something then; it remains one worth scrapping for now.
So is something else – the chance to win some respect, not just from England but also Erasmus.

She is also accused of stealing €70,614 last year from the television station at Westgate Business Park, Ballymount, Dublin 12.
Co-defendant, John Murray (39) who has the same address, is accused of handling the same amounts at a Bank of Ireland branch in Dublin.
Their case was back before Dublin District Court today. 
However, they did not have to attend due to the court’s covid-19 precautionary measures.
Investigating detective gardaí John Tuthill and David Jennings were present and sought further time to obtain directions from the DPP.
Detective Garda Jennings told Judge Bryan Smyth the covid crisis had caused delays in obtaining documents from banks and companies as staff were working from home.
Defence solicitor Luke Staines said the matter will clearly be going to the Circuit Court. He said the case commenced in March and the file was only going to the DPP now.
He asked Judge Smyth to consider the jurisdiction issue, in relation to the trial venue.
Judge Smyth said there was an explanation from the garda and it was reasonable due to the circumstances of the past eight months.
Detective Garda Jennings also told the court the investigation goes back over a 10-year period, 2009 to 2019. It involved bank accounts including one in the UK. He also described the file on the case as enormous.

Staines pointed out that the charges related to 2018 and last year but accepted that perhaps other matters may be coming later.

The Canary Islands have also turned orange on the map, which is published weekly every Thursday.
Under the new EU traffic light plan, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control publishes a weekly map of the EU using a three-stage colour system to indicate the level of risk in each area.
Levels are determined by a variety of epidemiological factors including the 14-day incidence per 100,000 population and the level of positive tests.
Ireland signed up to the plan in October, and it became fully operational this month.
The majority of Europe is listed as ‘red’. However, other than Ireland and the Canary Islands, Iceland, some Greek islands, Norway and the majority of Finland are orange. One region in Finland is listed as ‘green’.
As of earlier this month, travellers arriving from orange regions do not have to restrict their movements if they carry the results of a negative Covid-19 test taken three days before their arrival.

From midnight on 29 November, travellers arriving into Ireland from so-called ‘red’ regions in the new traffic light system will be advised that they no longer need to restrict their movements once they pass a Covid-19 PCR test (usually a nasal swab) five days following their arrival here.
Currently, a person is advised to restrict their movements for 14 days following arrival from a ‘red’ region.
Travellers from ‘green’ regions are not requested to restricted their movements or need a test prior to arrival. 
If you are travelling to a region that is listed as orange, passengers are urged to check the requirements in relation to testing and restrictions for their destination country, as each EU country sets its own rules.
Covid-19 test centres are no up and running at all major airports in Ireland, with a drive-thru centre opening for business at Dublin Airport today.

A walk-in facility for those without a car will open this weekend. Testing facilities are already open at Cork and Shannon Airports.
It’s expected that a few hundred people a day will be tested at the Express Green Long Term Car Park where the test facility is situated.
Passengers flying in and out of the country are expected to avail of the testing centre under the new travel regulations set out in the EU traffic light system.

With talk turning to Christmas, David Rock, the Chief executive of RocDoc – the private company which offers the service, said he fully expects to see a pick up in the numbers in the run up to Christmas, as people make plans to visit family and friends over the holidays.
Speaking about a testing facility the company also has open in Ashbourne, he said they are already seeing people with no Covid-19 symptoms attend to take a test for peace of mind.
“Yes, certainly, from the Ashbourne Centre, we’re finding there’s an awful lot of people doing that at the moment, where they have to go or want to go see their loved ones maybe before they pass away, or because they are critically ill, or for whatever other reason and they’re coming into us as a precautionary measure,” he aid.
“We see that possibly increasing during the Christmas time,” he said.
While initially the testing centre can handle a few hundred tests per day, capacity is being ramped up to carry out 12,000 tests per day, if needed.
“We were very keen to have this open before Christmas, because we don’t want Covid to spread in this country. We want to keep it under control. We feel testing is the best way to do that. That’s why we work with these test centres all over the country,” he said.
While opening hours are currently between 9am and 3pm, the company is looking to extend the hours if there is a surge in business before Christmas.

Other EU countries operate different testing regimes and travellers are urged to check the requirements for their destination country.
The National Virus Reference Laboratory (NVRL) is currently carrying out a validation process on LAMP testing, it is understood. If approved by the Department of Health, the new test could be incorporated into Ireland’s testing regime. 
RocDoc will be offering LAMP tests priced between €149 and €159. 
However, it is hoped that the cost of testing will reduce as demand increases, said Rock.

The Taoiseach has already indicated that it will largely come down to personal responsibility and choice.
In terms of international travel, Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said if people do need to travel home to see their family this Christmas they should follow the rules set out under the EU traffic light travel plan.
Speaking to Newstalk’s Pat Kenny, the health minister said there are two different parts to the government advice around international travel and Christmas, which he believes the public understand.
“The first part of the message is we’re in the middle of the biggest pandemic in 100 years… so the public health advice is if you don’t have to travel… in the middle of a global pandemic, which is causing so much hurt and pain and cost for everybody, then don’t.”
“The second part of the message is, however, if you do need to travel, and that includes if you haven’t seen your family, and if you do need to come home and see your family at Christmas, then there is a clear traffic light system in place with protocols you need to follow,” said Donnelly.

Facing questions in the Dáil today about the appointment of the former Attorney General as a judge in the State’s superior court, Varadkar rebuffed suggestions that the Minister for Justice Helen McEntee should take Dáil questions on the matter. 
Varadkar said it would be “a bad idea” to discuss the matter in the Dáil as it could lead to a debate on “the merits and demerits of individual candidates”. 
Sinn Fein TD Pearse Doherty TD asked Varadkar to acknowledge that Woulfe is a “close political ally and friend” of the Tánaiste and asked about Varadkar’s role in Woulfe’s appointment. 
Woulfe was nominated to the Supreme Court in mid-July, a number of weeks after the Fianna Fail-Fine Gael-Green Party government was formed. 
In response to Doherty’s questions, Varadkar said that the previous Fine Gael minority government he led could have filled the vacancy on the court but decided not to 
“The vacancy arose in the Supreme Court, I think around February of last year, it rose in the spring, I was at the time the Taoiseach of what people described as a caretaker government. We took a decision not to fill that vacancy,” Varadkar told the Dáil.
When the new government was being formed, I’m pretty sure it was the week before the new government was formed, the party leaders discussed whether or not Seamus Woulfe would be reappointed as Attorney General, or whether there’d be a new Attorney General. And we decided collectively that there would be a new Attorney General, and that Seamus Woulfe would not be reappointed as Attorney General. And at that point, for transparency and for information, I informed the other leaders that there was a vacancy, that Seamus Woulfe had been recommended by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board (JAAB) as suitable for that vacancy, and that was the end of the conversation.
Opposition parties have raised concerns about the selection process after it emerged last week that Cabinet was not told in July that a number of other judges had expressed interest in the vacancy on the Supreme Court before Woulfe was selected.

He said it is normal that only one name would come before Cabinet. 
Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy took issue with Varadkar’s choice of wording in saying that JAAB had recommended Woulfe, stating that the board does not rank individuals based on suitability.  
“It’s not the role of JAAB to recommend appointments, nor do they put them in pecking order where there are multiple applications. Yet the Taoiseach (sic) has told us repeatedly that there was one recommendation made to the Cabinet and the recommendation came through the JAAB process,” she said.

At the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), Adjudication Officer, Michael McEntee found that the 19-year-old catering worker was sexually harassed concerning her boss circulating the two images.
According to McEntee, the facts alleged that on 7 December 2019, the catering worker’s boss posted on a web group chat a picture of himself wearing only his boxer shorts.
The catering worker alleged that her then-boss made suggestive sexual comments regarding the boxer shorts.
Two days later on 9 December, the catering worker alleged that her boss also posted to the group chat an image of male genitalia on a flat white coffee cup top.
She stated that she found both images “quite disgusting and most upsetting”.
At the hearing, the images of the two group web texts were shown to McEntee.
The company investigation
The worker reported the incidents to her employer six weeks later last January and she stated that a female area manager suggested she move to a different branch of the chain.
The catering worker interpreted this as further discrimination as she was being asked to move rather than the alleged perpetrator.
She stated that she found the stress of the entire situation too much and took sick leave on stress grounds on 22 January last and resigned from the company on the 4 February.
In response to the complaint, the employer stated that it initiated an immediate investigation when informed and after an investigation, the manager was demoted from his manager role and reassigned at a lower rank to another branch of the chain.
The catering chain told the hearing that the behaviour complained of was completely unprofessional of a manager but was done in the context of webchat group involving males and females, was never repeated and was not the subject of any other complaints from other, potentially impacted, staff members.
The WRC findings
In his findings, McEntee stated that while the employer had been admirable in the post-incident actions, they had erred in the preventative stage.
McEntee commented that the harassment took place and post-incident actions, while admirable, are it could be said “bolting the door after the horse has left”.
Making the €3,500 award for sexual harassment against the employer, McEntee stated that being a large employer of staff of mixed genders and nationalities an oversight in providing training and awareness in this area was a management weakness.
McEntee noted that local management had received any formal training in how to address sexual harassment and that the catering chain had recently commissioned a HR consultancy firm to conduct a company-wide training programme in this area.

Labour Court appeal
Employment law expert, Richard Grogan represented the catering worker in the case.
Grogan confirmed that the quantum of the award is being appealed to the Labour Court.
He stated: “We do not believe the level of compensation awarded compensates our client for the sexual harassment she endured.”
Grogan stated that the images at the centre of the case are “reprehensible and a very serious breach of her rights but equally, such low awards in no way, in our opinion, can be seen as a deterrent for the employer to take the steps necessary to ensure no further repeat will occur”.
The Dublin based solicitor stated: “Sexual harassment of either men or women is an egregious breach of equality legislation and dignity in the workplace.”

The arrest comes after a search was carried out in the Monaghan area yesterday. Officers from the Garda National Immigration Bureau seized documentation and electronic devices during the operation.
The arrested man is being held at Ballymun Garda Station. The search was carried out as part of Operation Mombasa – a multi-jurisdictional investigation that commenced in late 2018 centred on an organised crime group of non-nationals (primarily Georgian) who are known to be resident in Ireland.
The crime group is suspected of facilitating the smuggling of illegal immigrants, supplying false identity documents and money laundering.
The head of the Garda National Immigration Bureau, Detective Chief Superintendent Seamus Boland said: “An Garda Síochána is committed to targeting organised crime groups that are suspected to prey on the most vulnerable in our society for financial gain.
“We will continue to work closely with our international partners, including Europol, to ensure that coordinated investigations extend beyond our borders and dismantle these organised crime groups.”
Operation Mombasa was established as a result of Icelandic and Spanish authorities intercepting Georgian nationals within their jurisdiction committing criminal offences. Inquiries conducted ascertained that some of these Georgian nationals had sourced false documents from Ireland.
Subsequent inquiries, and the interception and seizure by An Garda Síochána of suspected parcels from An Post, established that packages had been addressed to non-European nationals in various EU member states.

The UK royal said the independent probe into Martin Bashir’s controversial television appearance with Diana, Princess of Wales in 1995 was a “step in the right direction”.
Source: PA
The BBC has appointed Lord Dyson, former president of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, to lead the investigation, which will begin straight away and seek to discover what steps the broadcaster and Bashir took to land the interview.
Second in line to the English throne William said: “The independent investigation is a step in the right direction.
It should help establish the truth behind the actions that led to the Panorama interview and subsequent decisions taken by those in the BBC at the time.
The investigation comes after allegations by Diana’s brother Earl Spencer that he was shown “false bank statements” by Bashir and that these statements were used to help the reporter gain access to the princess.
The result was the explosive interview 25 years ago in which Diana famously said: “Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.”
The BBC has claimed Diana had written a note saying she did not see the false bank statements and that they played no part in her decision to give the interview.
The investigation will consider if the steps taken by the BBC and Bashir were appropriate and to what extent those actions influenced Diana’s decision to give an interview.
It will also investigate what knowledge the BBC had in 1995 and 1996 of “mocked up bank statements purporting to show payments to a former employee of Earl Spencer (and) the purported payments to members of the Royal Households”, the corporation said.
Source: BBC
The graphic designer who mocked up the documents allegedly used to secure the interview has said he was made “the fall guy” by the BBC, and called on the broadcaster to apologise.
Bashir, who is now religion editor at the BBC, is currently signed off from work.
A statement from the corporation said: “He is currently recovering from quadruple heart bypass surgery and has significant complications from having contracted Covid-19 earlier in the year.”
The princess sent shockwaves through the monarchy after the interview, which included candid details about her marriage and the Prince of Wales’s rumoured relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles, his now wife.
Diana also questioned Charles’s suitability as king.

It marks the 100-year anniversary of Bloody Sunday, the darkest day in Gaelic games’ history.
On that fateful day at Croke Park in 1920, 14 people were murdered when members of the Crown Forces opened fire during the football meeting of Dublin and Tipperary; one of the victims Premier corner back Michael Hogan of the Grangemockler club.
While Tipperary previously announced their plans to wear a replica green and white jersey for this year’s Munster football final to coincide with the anniversary, Dublin revealed a special commemorative jersey for Saturday’s Leinster final last night.
They’ll wear the number 14 on one sleeve, with the names of each of the victims included, and a GAA Bloody Sunday commemorative logo on the other as they face Meath at Croke Park.
A centenary commemoration ceremony will take place before throw-in, while there were plans to have a ceremonial ‘finishing of the match.’ The GAA has done so much to remember the 14 who went to a match and never came home over the past few days and weeks, and President John Horan asked members this week to light a candle in their homes for those who died.
Meanwhile, Tipperary’s green and white jersey will feature an image of Michael Hogan on the sleeve along with the official county and GAA crests while team sponsors Teneo have agreed to forego their name on the front of this commemorative jersey.

494,189,"'Wagatha Christie' case reaches High Court as Rebekah Vardy sues Coleen Rooney for libel",https://www.thejournal.ie/rooney-vardy-court-5271828-Nov2020/,"COLEEN ROONEY FALSELY accused Rebekah Vardy of a “clear betrayal of trust” for allegedly leaking stories about her private life, the High Court has heard.
Rooney, 34, was dubbed “Wagatha Christie” on social media for her apparent sleuthing work, having “posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into The Sun” as part of a “sting operation”.
The wife of former England footballer Wayne Rooney claimed in October that fellow footballer’s wife Vardy, 38, shared the fake stories she had posted on her personal Instagram account.
Rooney wrote: “For a few years now someone who I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing The Sun newspaper of my private posts and stories.”
She dramatically added: “I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them.
“It’s ……………. Rebekah Vardy’s account.”
Vardy, who is married to Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy, has denied the accusations and is suing Rooney for damages for libel.
At the first hearing of their high-profile legal battle today, Mr Justice Warby is being asked to determine the “natural and ordinary” meaning of Rooney’s posts on Instagram and Twitter.
Vardy’s barrister Hugh Tomlinson QC said Rooney’s posts were an “untrue and unjustified defamatory attack” which was “published and republished to millions of people”.
He said Rooney’s accusation “leaves the reasonable reader in no doubt that the defendant is accusing the claimant of consistently and repeatedly betraying her trust over several years”.
He added:
In fact, she did nothing wrong. Whatever leaks there were did not come from her.
Tomlinson said Rooney’s post featured “a build-up to the ‘big reveal’ of the identity of the person responsible”, adding: “The description of the defendant’s detective work makes it clear that the claimant is being said to be responsible for the leaking of the three specific stories mentioned.”
Rooney claimed Vardy leaked three “false stories” she posted on Instagram about “gender selection in Mexico”, Rooney returning to TV, and the basement in her new house flooding.
Vardy’s lawyers argue that the meaning of Rooney’s posts was that she had “consistently and repeatedly betrayed the defendant’s trust over several years by leaking the defendant’s private and personal Instagram posts and stories for publication in The Sun”.
Rooney’s legal team say the posts mean “there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the claimant was responsible for consistently passing on information about the defendant’s private Instagram posts and stories to The Sun newspaper”.
David Sherborne, representing Rooney, said in written submissions:
It is true that the claimant was responsible for consistently passing on information about the defendant’s private Instagram posts and stories to The Sun, and that this was part of her history and practice of providing private information to the press, especially The Sun, with whom she had a very close relationship.
He said Rooney’s post accusing Vardy of leaking the stories “followed earlier warnings which the defendant had been forced to post publicly, as well as privately, as a result of information from her private social media accounts being leaked to The Sun”.
He added: “The defendant was so concerned that she even posted a number of fake stories on her private Instagram account in order to discover where the leak was coming from.”
Sherborne told the court Rooney conducted a “sting operation” to find out the source of the leaks, and “deliberately limited the accessibility to this private account and the sting operation stories” to just Mrs Vardy.
He said: “The fact that these sting operation stories also then appeared in The Sun, after access to her private account was limited to just the @beckyvardy account, is the reason why the defendant published the post which is the subject of this claim.
The impression the reader would take away would be the essential message, that it was Rebekah Vardy’s account that was the source of private stories about the defendant appearing in The Sun – not Rebekah Vardy herself.
“The impression the post gives the ordinary reader stops short of guilt.”

Stress
In her written claim filed with the court, Vardy said she had worried she would lose her baby because of the stress as she was pregnant at the time.
Her barrister wrote that she felt suicidal, took three trips to hospital due to her anxiety, and worried about either going into early labour or losing her baby due to the stress.
Tomlinson said: “The claimant has suffered extreme distress, hurt, anxiety and embarrassment as a result of the publication of the post and the events which followed.
“The abuse that followed the post made the claimant feel suicidal. She suffered from severe panic attacks and anxiety which manifested in being scared to leave her house.”
The filing detailed some of the ways Rooney’s post was reported and repeated on social media.
Following a tweet from Donald Trump, some users joked that Vardy was the new leader of the so-called Islamic State terror group, while others later said she was involved in the disappearance of Madeline McCann.
Tomlinson added:
Following the police announcing that a new suspect had been identified in the disappearance of Madeline McCann, the claimant (Mrs Vardy) was the subject of a number of highly distressing publications on Twitter alleging she was the suspect.
Social media users also posted that Vardy was involved in a potential hack of the mobile video-conferencing app Houseparty in March this year.

495,189,"Georgia hand recount result expected to confirm Biden win",https://www.thejournal.ie/georgia-recount-biden-win-expected-5271782-Nov2020/,"THE RESULTS OF a hand count of the Georgia election results are set to be announced with expectations they will confirm Democrat Joe Biden’s narrow lead over Republican President Donald Trump.
The hand tally of about five million votes stemmed from an audit required by a new state law and was not in response to any suspected problems with the state’s results or an official recount request.
The state has until Friday to confirm results that have previously been certified and submitted by the counties.
The counties were supposed to finish the hand count by 11.59pm on Wednesday.
Gabriel Sterling, who oversaw the implementation of the state’s new voting system, said he expected the secretary of state’s office to put out a report on the results by midday today.
Once the state certifies the election results, the losing campaign has two business days to request a recount if the margin remains within 0.5%.
That recount would be done using scanners that read and tally the votes and would be paid for by the counties, Sterling said.
It was up to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to select the race to be audited, and he said the presidential race made the most sense because of its significance and the tight margin separating the candidates.
Because of that small margin, Raffensperger said a full hand recount was necessary.
Going into the recount, Biden led Trump by a margin of about 14,000 votes. Previously uncounted ballots discovered in four counties during the hand count will reduce that margin to about 12,800, Sterling said.

Opinion: Why Biden’s presidency will be defined by the Georgia vote in January
Other counties found slight differences in results as they did their hand counts, and state election officials had consistently said that was to be expected.
The claims of fraud in Georgia have sparked infighting among Republicans, with Raffensperger stating categorically that the election was fair and secure.
Georgia’s two Republican US senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, have demanded Raffensperger’s resignation.
The pair both face run-offs against their Democratic challengers on 5 January in crucial contests that will decide which party controls the Senate.
The Associated Press has not declared a winner in Georgia, where Biden led Trump by about 0.3 percentage points.
There is no mandatory recount law in Georgia but state law provides that option to a trailing candidate if the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points.

While the world takes hope from recent news about promising Covid-19 vaccines, African health officials also worry that the continent will suffer as richer countries buy up supplies.
Several African countries have confirmed virus cases in the six figures. South Africa leads with more than 750,000, while Morocco has more than 300,000, Egypt more than 110,000 and Ethiopia more than 100,000.

A years-long internal investigation into military misconduct was released today, prompting the Chief of the Australian Defence Force to admit a “destructive” culture of impunity among special forces leading to a string of alleged murders and cover-ups spanning years.
“Some patrols took the law into their own hands, rules were broken, stories concocted, lies told and prisoners killed,” General Angus Campbell said, apologising “sincerely and unreservedly” to the people of Afghanistan.
“This shameful record includes alleged instances in which new patrol members were coerced to shoot a prisoner in order to achieve that soldier’s first kill, in an appalling practice known as ‘blooding’.”
The report also reported evidence that troops were engaged in “body count competitions”, and covered up unlawful killings by staging skirmishes, planting weapons and adding names to target lists retrospectively.
The military’s own inspector general produced the harrowing 465-page official inquiry into events between 2005 and 2016 that detailed dozens of killings “outside the heat of battle”.
It recommended 19 individuals be referred to Australian Federal Police, compensation be paid to the families of victims, and the military makes a slew of reforms.
Campbell went a step further, saying those involved had brought a “stain” on their regiment, on the armed forces and on Australia, and would be referred to the office of the special investigator for war crimes.
He also moved to revoke distinguished service medals awarded to special operations forces who served in Afghanistan between 2007 and 2013.
After 11 September 11 2001 attacks, more than 26,000 Australian uniformed personnel were sent to Afghanistan to fight alongside US and allied forces against the Taliban, Al-Qaeda and other Islamist groups.
Australian combat troops officially left the country in 2013, but since then a series of often-brutal accounts have emerged about the conduct of elite special forces units.
They range from reports of troops killing a six-year-old child in a house raid, to a prisoner being shot dead to save space in a helicopter.
‘Brutal truths’ 
Prime Minister Scott Morrison attempted to cushion the blow of the report, telling Australians last week to brace for the “honest and brutal truths” contained within the heavily redacted document, which censors many highly infammatory details.
Morrison also called his Afghan counterpart Wednesday to foreshadow “some disturbing allegations” that the government was taking “very seriously”.
The office of President Ashraf Ghani said Morrison had “expressed his deepest sorrow over the misconduct”.
Last week, Morrison announced the appointment of a special investigator to prosecute the alleged war crimes, a move aimed at forestalling any prosecution at the International Criminal Court.
The revelations will “definitely” be used by the Taliban to restate calls “for foreign forces to withdraw from Afghanistan”, Srinjoy Bose, an international relations lecturer at the University of New South Wales, told AFP.
#OPEN JOURNALISM No news is bad news Support The Journal Your contributions will help us continue to deliver the stories that are important to you

“I would imagine that the Australian presence in Afghanistan, for the coming weeks and months, will be afforded greater protection.”
The revelations are also a serious blow to the prestige of the country’s military, which is widely revered by Australians.
Its historic campaigns – from Gallipoli in World War I to Kokoda in Papua during World War II – have played a crucial role in fostering the country’s identity, independent of colonial power Britain.
“It speaks to a failure that is bigger and deeper than the soldiers involved in the atrocities,” said John Blaxland of the Australian National University, which has close ties to the security establishment.

504,189,"Oxford Covid-19 vaccine produces strong immune response in older adults, study finds",https://www.thejournal.ie/oxford-covid-19-study-vaccine-5271623-Nov2020/,"THE UNIVERSITY OF Oxford is expected to release data on the effectiveness of its coronavirus vaccine in the coming weeks, with the latest trial results suggesting it produces a strong immune response in older adults.
The ChAdOx1 nCov-2019 vaccine has been shown to trigger a robust immune response in healthy adults aged 56-69 and people over 70.
Phase two data, published in The Lancet, suggests one of the groups most vulnerable to serious illness and death from Covid-19 could build immunity, researchers say.
According to the researchers, volunteers in the trial demonstrated similar immune responses across all three age groups (18-55, 56-69, and 70 and over).
The study of 560 healthy adults – including 240 over the age of 70 – found the vaccine is better tolerated in older people compared with younger adults.
Volunteers received two doses of the vaccine candidate, or a placebo meningitis vaccine.
No serious adverse health events related to the vaccine were seen in the participants.
The results are consistent with phase one data reported for healthy adults aged 18-55 earlier this year.
Dr Maheshi Ramasamy, investigator at the Oxford Vaccine Group and consultant physician, said: “Older adults are a priority group for Covid-19 vaccination, because they are at increased risk of severe disease, but we know that they tend to have poorer vaccine responses.
“We were pleased to see that our vaccine was not only well tolerated in older adults, but also stimulated similar immune responses to those seen in younger volunteers.
“The next step will be to see if this translates into protection from the disease itself.”
Study lead author Professor Andrew Pollard, from the University of Oxford, said: “Immune responses from vaccines are often lessened in older adults because the immune system gradually deteriorates with age, which also leaves older adults more susceptible to infections.
“As a result, it is crucial that Covid-19 vaccines are tested in this group who are also a priority group for immunisation.”
Researchers say their findings are promising as they show that the older people are showing a similar immune response to younger adults.

Dr Ramasamy added: “The robust antibody and T-cell responses seen in older people in our study are encouraging.
“The populations at greatest risk of serious Covid-19 disease include people with existing health conditions and older adults.
“We hope that this means our vaccine will help to protect some of the most vulnerable people in society, but further research will be needed before we can be sure.”
The study also found the vaccine, being developed with AstraZeneca, was less likely to cause local reactions at the injection site and symptoms on the day of vaccination in older adults than in the younger group.
Adverse reactions were mild – injection-site pain and tenderness, fatigue, headache, feverishness and muscle pain – but more common than seen with the control vaccine.
13 serious adverse events occurred in the six months since the first dose was given, none of which were related to either study vaccine.
The authors note some limitations to their study, including that the participants in the oldest age group had an average age of 73-74 and few underlying health conditions, so they may not be representative of the general older population, including those living in residential care settings or aged over 80.
Phase three trials of the vaccine are ongoing, with early efficacy readings possible in the coming weeks.

The vote was held yesterday evening and saw 87 TDs – from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Green Party, Regional group and Independent group – voting in favour. 57 TDs from other parties voted against. 
No debate was held on the motion, despite objection to this by opposition politicians. 
Representatives from both Sinn Féin and the Social Democrats had been among those to criticise the government for not facilitating a debate on the nomination. 
Feeney is a former Fianna Fáil Senator who was nominated by the government for one of the two vacant positions on political ethics watchdog Sipo. 
The other nominee is Justice Garrett Sheehan, whose nomination was not objected to in the Dáil and who will become Sipo chairperson. 
The position being filled by Feeney is required to be filled by a former member of the Oireachtas. 
Deputy Paul Murphy last week asked Sipo to investigate if Tánaiste Leo Varadkar had breached the code of conduct for office holders when he passed a confidential document to former NAPG president Maitiú Ó Tuathail. 
The now defunct NAGP union came into existence in 2013 but went into liquidation in 2019.
Feeney is listed on the State’s lobbying register as a former lobbyist who had lobbied on behalf of the NAGP in 2017 and 2018, including a meeting with now Taoiseach Micheál Martin in May 2017. 
In the Dáil on Tuesday, the Taoiseach said that ”notwithstanding” the current NAGP controversy Feeney’s appointment is “in line with the requirements of the legislation”.
Sinn Féin TD Pearse Doherty described it as “breathtaking arrogance” that the government would not facilitate a debate on the appointment. He also queried whether Feeney had made all the necessary filings to Sipo.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday morning, Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy said that questions over Feeney’s lobbying in the past needed to be answered, particularly in light of the request to Sipo in relation to the NAGP.
“I would have thought that a great deal of care needs to be taken when people are being appointed to something like the Standards and Public Office Commission because that is the body that owns everybody else to account,” she said. 
“The very fact of lobbying had been done in relation to that organisation where there is a complaint already gone. I would have thought was it was going to be an obvious question that would have been asked.”

Impossible to make definitive judgements on Kenny and Ireland amid freak set of circumstances
IF YOU WERE to focus purely at the results for Ireland since Stephen Kenny took charge, the outlook would be far from encouraging.
In eight games since the Dubliner took over, the Irish team have drawn four and lost four. In that period, they have scored just once — all the way back in the coach’s first game in charge away to Bulgaria on 3 September.
Perhaps the most damning statistic of all is the fact that it is now approximately 11 hours since the side’s last goal.
Yet the context should also be taken into account of any criticism of the team.
Prior to last night’s game, the Irish team were without 13 players who had been picked in the original squad. You can literally make an entire team out of missing individuals who could potentially have been included.
Kenny spoke last night with frustration at how many of his grand plans for this team, in terms of preparation, had been ruined owing to the coronavirus pandemic.
Conor Hourihane talked prior to the game about his considerable worries in relation to potentially contracting Covid-19, and it is hard to believe he is the only player holding these significant concerns.
Predictably, the Kenny era has already attracted substantial criticism from a certain portion of people who believe the manager is ‘out of his depth’ — many of whom likely felt someone with a League of Ireland background should not have been given the job in the first place.
Yet such criticism is unfair, as it fails to take into account that the deeply unusual circumstances in which the players and management team are being forced to operate. Indeed, in each window, Kenny has had to cope with issues that no Irish manager before him has faced.
The plane debacle involving Adam Idah and Aaron Connolly ahead of the vital Slovakia qualifier alone felt like a cruel blow, but as it turned out, that was only the start of a series of unfortunate events.
We are living in extraordinary times and the manager as well as his squad deserve to be cut some slack as a result.
2. Inexperienced players catch the eye
Aside from avoiding relegation to the third tier of the Nations League, perhaps the biggest positive Kenny can take from the game is the performances of some of Ireland’s less experienced players.
19-year-old Derby midfielder Jason Knight was arguably the hosts’ most impressive performer on the night, with his penetrating runs and intelligent passing causing problems for their opponents.
Asked to do a job at right back, having operated centrally against England and Wales, Dara O’Shea produced another solid performance that belied his 21 years.
Though he missed a few decent chances, admitting as much afterwards, Luton’s James Collins showed good movement off the ball and looked a genuine goal threat.
Ronan Curtis also was sharp, particularly in the first half, while despite only playing once at club level this season, Ryan Manning did not look out of place on the international stage before perhaps unsurprisingly having to come off with cramp towards the end.

The substitutes also had an impact. In particular, Jack Byrne and Josh Cullen made the most of what little time they had on the field, frequently demanding the ball and attempting positive, incisive passes.
While the result was again underwhelming, it was certainly not a wasted night from Kenny’s perspective.
3. Marcus Harness makes a surprise appearance

Marcus Harness made an appearance on the sidelines at the Aviva Stadium last night, though he was not an official part of the squad for the game.
Back in June 2019, it was confirmed by Mick McCarthy that the 24-year-old Portsmouth winger was declaring for the Republic of Ireland.
So far this season, the Coventry-born player has seven goals in 16 appearances, with Pompey currently trailing League One leaders Peterborough by four points.
The fact that he would take the trouble to link up with the Irish squad in the middle of a pandemic, two days after lining out for his club, certainly suggests he is committed to the cause.
It would also seemingly indicate that Kenny feels he could be a significant addition to the squad, who is worth integrating, even in these awkward circumstances.
4. World Cup qualification likely to be a formidable task
With Ireland now confirmed as being in Pot 3 for the upcoming World Cup qualification draw, an already extremely difficult task appears to have been made slightly harder.
Of course, the luck of the draw will still have a substantial say in terms of just how daunting a task it will be for Ireland to reach Qatar in 2022.
The full list of permutations are outlined here, with France and Switzerland seemingly the nightmare prospect, and the familiar duo of Denmark coupled with Slovakia the ostensible best-case scenario in terms of teams placed in pots above the Boys in Green.
Yet it seems regardless of who Kenny’s side are paired with, qualification represents a formidable task.
Qualifying is almost twice as difficult as it is for the Euros. Whereas for the latter, there are 24 spots available, there are just 13 places available for European sides at the World Cup.
So essentially, Ireland must either win their group, which could among others include England, Germany, Spain, or Belgium, or be one of the three teams that qualifies via a convoluted play-off process not dissimilar to the one for the Euros, with one-off semi-finals and a final taking place.
Even allowing for all the caveats with regard to Kenny’s reign so far, on current form, Ireland’s World Cup qualification chances appear slim.
The former Dundalk boss has already overcome the odds plenty of times already in his managerial career, of course. And taking this Irish team to a first World Cup since 2002, given their current predicament, would surely be as improbable a feat as anything he has achieved thus far in the game.","The team’s winless run continued last night against Bulgaria.",1,0,0,17260,"Thu 6:30 AM"

Confused by the current travel advice? You're not alone. Here's everything you need to know right now
Speaking to Newstalk’s Pat Kenny, the health minister said there are two different parts to the government advice around international travel and Christmas, which he believes the public understand.
“The first part of the message is we’re in the middle of the biggest pandemic in 100 years… so the public health advice is if you don’t have to travel… in the middle of a global pandemic, which is causing so much hurt and pain and cost for everybody, then don’t.”
“The second part of the message is, however, if you do need to travel, and that includes if you haven’t seen your family, and if you do need to come home and see your family at Christmas, then there is a clear traffic light system in place with protocols you need to follow,” said Donnelly.
“I think that is a pretty common sense approach,” he said.
Under the new EU traffic light plan, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control publishes a weekly map of the EU using a three-stage colour system to indicate the level of risk in each area: green, orange and red.
Levels are determined by a variety of epidemiological factors including the 14-day incidence per 100,000 population and the level of positive tests.
Currently, as the second wave rages on the continent, pretty much everywhere is ‘red’. There’s a smattering of orange areas and absolutely no green. 
Ireland signed up to the plan in October.

The Department of Health confirmed yesterday evening that a further 12 people have died, bringing the total number of deaths to 2,006.
A further 379 new cases of the virus were also confirmed, bringing the total number of cases in Ireland to 69,058.
Commenting on the milestone of 2,000 deaths being reached, Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan noted how much the pandemic has impacted families and communities across the country.
The daily updates on case and death numbers have become a routine part of life in recent months. But behind every number are family members and friends who are grieving the loss of a loved one.
Bereavement is always difficult, but during a pandemic it’s even harder.
Paying respects and showing support has become a largely virtual affair in 2020 – a rather alien concept in a country where it is, or was, common for hundreds of people at a time to congregate as a person was laid to rest.
Even if their loved one didn’t die from Covid-19, anybody who has been bereaved since March “has been impacted by Covid”, Orla Keegan, head of Education and Bereavement at the Irish Hospice Foundation (IHF), said.
The IHF launched a bereavement helpline (1800 80 70 77) in the summer and has received about 600 calls from people since then.
“We hear from people who’ve been bereaved because somebody they loved died with Covid. And we’re also talking to substantial numbers of people whose loved person died from another cause,” she told TheJournal.ie.
The cause of death is not the main issue, Keegan adds, it’s the fact a person they love has died.
“Grief takes the rug out from under you, regardless of what has happened, in that each loss is unique. This is your loved person who has died.”
Keegan said people who contact the helpline may have been bereaved several years ago but they are still grieving and need support. Some others who were bereaved earlier this year are only starting to feel the true weight of the loss now.
“They’re saying ‘it’s just beginning to land on me now, the reality of things’.
We’re not through a pandemic, we’re in it, so those people have had to adjust in a very exaggerated way.
“They were just getting on with it, and only now are they beginning to really feel ‘okay this has happened, this is what it means to me’.”
Keegan noted that when a loved one dies, a person’s “whole world is really turned upside down” and they have to adapt to a new reality. However, in the time of Covid-19, people are already adapting to a new, unprecedented reality – and many don’t have the same social network, at least in person, they typically would have.
“It’s a loneliness on top of a loneliness.
“You’ve been thrust into a changed world because somebody has died, so every aspect of your world is now new and you’re trying to make sense of that.
It could be the person that you usually turned to is the one who has died. They could be the person you ring first thing in the morning and they’re not there anymore.
“You’re reminded all the time that they are not around, your world is intrinsically changed. You’re left trying to adapt and that’s hard, hard work.
“And on top of that we’re all adapting to the loss of our normal world because of Covid. So it’s the layer upon layer of stress that people are facing.”
Another thing that has changed because of the pandemic is, of course, funerals.
Under Level 5 of Covid-19 restrictions, a maximum of 25 people can attend funerals. Earlier this year, during the first wave of the pandemic, just 10 people could attend.
Keegan noted that funerals are “totally different” now. The ritual of the funeral process was something people could “rely on” in the immediate aftermath of a death. Now that is largely gone.
“We used to rely very much on those sort of scripts, we all understood them. There was a procedure that we would go through and there were ‘landmarks’ in the days of grieving immediately after a person died.”
The lack of a ‘typical’ funeral, with a large crowd of mourners and sympathisers, has “hit people hard” and made them feel isolated, Keegan noted.
‘Which 25 people?’
Jonathan Stafford, managing director of Staffords Funeral Homes in Dublin, said choosing which 25 people attend a funeral is often very difficult for a family. 
“You would have families with 150 in the family, so just the immediate family can attend, and the others will stand outside social-distancing, and pay respect in that way. Some of the churches have outside speakers, or some people will just watch on the webcam.”
Mourners tell Stafford that death amid the pandemic is “more surreal”.
Death and grief is difficult enough but in this current phase of Covid, it’s just so, so bizarre.
Even if people can’t go into the church, they often line the streets as a mark of respect.
“Recently we’ve had a number of funerals that would have been very, very large funerals in the ‘normal times’, let’s call it,” Stafford explained. 
“People are still supportive but obviously from a distance. It’s just that on the day (of the funeral) it’s so different.

Socialising, funerals and people 'taking their eye off the ball': Concerns over uptick in Covid cases
“I’ve noticed an awful lot of people gathering outside the churches, obviously social-distancing, and lining the roads. If the person is going from the house to the church, the neighbours will line the road.”
In recent days there has been a increase in Covid-19 cases, prompting Dr Tony Holohan to note two specific concerns – people gathering socially and for funerals.
Holohan said there have been a number of outbreaks associated with funerals amid reports of large crowds at wakes and churches.
“We understand that this is a difficult time for families but it is really important that we do everything we can to avoid the circumstances which promote transmission of the virus,” he said last week. 
The Irish Association of Funeral Directors said non-compliance with the guidelines has been observed at some funerals, particularly in rural areas.
Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland yesterday, IAFD spokesperson Mary Cunniffe said, at some funerals, more than 25 people are attending and some are not social-distancing or wearing face masks.
She said funeral directors are strongly recommending to families that the arrangements must be in line with Covid-19 guidelines.
Stafford said 99% of families understand the restrictions are necessary to “protect people”, and the other 1% usually “come around” after giving it some thought. He noted that the priests he has worked with in recent months also take the restrictions very seriously.
In his experience, when people are gathering they’re keeping two metres apart and often wearing face masks.
From a practical point of view, Stafford said little has changed for funeral directors. “Everything is nearly the same, apart from the amount of people that attend the funeral.”
‘Out of control’
Stafford said April was probably the most difficult month in terms of funerals – there was a large surge in Covid-19 cases and deaths in the early weeks of the pandemic.
“Going back to April, it was really out of control. That was the most difficult part for many funeral directors,” he said, before stressing that the difficulty faced by bereaved people is obviously much greater.
I was so worried that the same thing was going to happen, and my peers in the funeral sector were saying the same thing. The worst thing that could happen is if what happened at the end of March and April happened again, that would have been shocking.
“But the fact is, it looks like the government have done a good job in containing it,” Stafford said.
He said restrictions resulted in the number of Covid-related deaths flattening during the summer. “In the last month or so, we’ve obviously seen a rise, but not massively so,” he added.
Stafford said, it “depends on the age and the profile of the person”, but many people who died after contracting Covid-19 died before their time. Death, he told us, “came too soon for an awful lot of people”.
In September the government launched a 60-page plan on how people in Ireland will live with Covid-19 in the coming months. The document includes a section called “remembering our loss” which details how we’ll mark and reflect on everything we’ve gone through.

SUPPORT US NOW
The government’s plan states that Covid-19 has “brought grief and loss to our lives in ways that most of us have not experienced in our lifetime” and “raised our awareness of the importance of the processes and rituals related to bereavement, dying and death”.
“It is important as a people that we pause and reflect, take time to remember and pay tribute both to those who have lost their lives but also to everyone who has contributed to how we have faced and are facing the challenges together.”
The plan proposes a programme of national and local events to commemorate those we have lost, celebrating those who’ve helped us survive and ensure there is support for those who feel alone or lost.
The government has said it will collaborate with the media, civil society organisations and church groups on the approach and timing.
‘Reach in’
Keegan said people who are bereaved may feel as though “they’re locked away from others and that people can’t understand them”, but this isn’t the case.
“Reach out – that can be within your own circle, to a trusted person, or reach out and make a phone call to the helpline.
“And if you know somebody who’s been bereaved, ‘reach in’ to them because often people are embarrassed or they don’t want to upset someone, or they think ‘they seem to be doing well, I don’t want to start talking about the person who died’.
“No, take the chance and make the call and say, ‘How are you doing?’, Mention the name of the person who died, ask is there anything you can do,” Keegan advises.
For the person who is bereaved, the individual is gone, the body of the person is gone, but they certainly do live on in the heart and the memory of the bereaved person. Most bereaved people like to know that other people remember them too. To create an opportunity for a conversation is usually a good thing.
In terms of parents trying to help a child come to terms with a death, Keegan said “talking honestly” to children, in a way that manages their anxiety, is really important.
“Children are hearing about death so much now. Death is everywhere – on the radio, in the newspapers, it’s what people are talking about.
“It’s really a very changed and strange world.”
The IHF has developed a section on its website that specifically deals with grief during the pandemic, and it includes advice and information to help people of all ages who are grieving.

The 221+ group wrote to Stephen Donnelly today accusing the Government of “ignoring” it and of “playing politics” with the issues affecting women impacted by the controversy.
The group was set up in the wake of the original CervicalCheck scandal by former health minister Simon Harris.
The minister brought a memo to Cabinet last month that would set up the long-awaited tribunal to investigate negligence in the State’s cervical cancer screening programme. The tribunal was first announced by government in 2018.
However, campaigner Vicky Phelan expressed anger about the establishment of the tribunal at the time, saying that women and families were not afforded an opportunity to respond to the minister’s decision before it was announced.
Discussions have continued in recent weeks, but a letter from the group to Donnelly today accused the Government of changing its position and suggested that it increasingly viewed further dialogue as “pointless”.
The group said in a statement that it wrote to Donnelly following comments by Taoiseach Micheál Martin in the Dáil yesterday, which the group said referred to movements on the tribunal and also mentioned a further Cabinet review next week.
“It seems that that we are back to learning about Government’s views on the CervicalCheck Tribunal at the same time as the public,” the letter read.

“We are getting to the point where this discourse is pointless when what we have offered by way of input and evidence is either being ignored or we are being talked over.”
The group also re-iterated that it had no basis to express confidence in the proposed tribunal.
It added that it believed “time is up” to discuss the tribunal, and that the group’s executive committee would tell its members that it would stop doing so by the weekend if the minister could not provide a basis for discussions to continue in the coming days.","The 221+ group wrote to Health Minister Stephen Donnelly today.",33,0,0,17624,"Wed 10:47 PM"

The Health Information and Quality Authority (Hiqa) said that certain activities and settings may need more public health measures as they are “conducive to superspreading”.
These high risk settings or activities include: health and social care settings, meat and food processing plants, cruise ships, prisons, shopping malls, religious settings, bars, nightclubs and restaurants, gyms, offices, weddings and large shared accommodation.
Hiqa said this is not a definitive list. It also identified the risk in households, and said that there is “a clear rationale” for self-isolation guidelines within households.
According to an analysis by Hiqa, the main factors found to contribute to transmission risk include:
indoor environments,
crowds, and
prolonged and intense contact with others.
Other important factors may include:
the level of ventilation,
speaking volume,
insufficient use of face coverings,
the viral load of the index case.
Activities involving dining, drinking, exercising, singing or shouting, prolonged face-to-face conversation, especially in-indoor crowded environments, were associated with an increased risk of transmission in several studies, Hiqa said.
Hiqa said that households play “an important role” in the transmission of coronavirus. Based on international literature, it said, the estimated ‘secondary attack rate’ in household settings is 18%, compared with <1% in healthcare settings.
RELATED READ

In work settings, additional factors found to be related to the spread of Covid include: working despite symptoms (‘presenteeism’); a lack of access to hand-washing facilities; and an inadequate or inappropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE).
For schools, Hiqa says that because they are “supervised, controlled” environments, they are assumed to be of less risk than incidents like house parties, which are “unsupervised, uncontrolled” environments.
The report notes:
Although schools, may potentially be viewed as high risk settings (due to high density, close proximity for prolonged durations, indoor setting etc.), it was noted that this is not reflected in the Irish data with relatively few clusters (2% of all reported clusters), consistently low test positivity rates and limited evidence of transmission occurring in the school setting.
“This highlights that transmission risks within school populations can be effectively mitigated with the implementation of proper protective measures.”

Bulgaria 0
THIS GOTHIC HORROR continues. 
In an empty ground, all that was audible was the fierce wind buffeting and battering the Aviva; it was a gale that shook the stadium’s glass exterior and whistled through the concourse to give this game a strong horror aesthetic, morphing the vast and lonely ground into the kind of gothic mansion found in an Edgar Allen Poe story. 
Ireland drew 0-0 with Bulgaria to at least avoid relegation to League C in the Nations League, but they are now guaranteed to be third seeds in the World Cup qualifiers draw and their record-setting goalless run is now at 11 hours.
Their single goal of 2020 came from a set piece last September; by the time the World Cup qualifiers come around it will have been 16 months since they last scored from open play. 
Tonight they started poorly but grew into the game, then hit the crossbar and spurned a glorious opportunity but once again failed to score and failed to win. 
The latest five to be declared missing for this game were Hendrick, Molumby, McClean, Doherty and Idah, so Kenny shuffled Dara O’Shea across to right back and gave Ryan Manning a senior debut. Jason Knight made his full debut in midfield alongside Conor Hourihane, with Ronan Curtis, Robbie Brady, Daryl Horgan and James Collins the front four entrusted with ending the goal drought.
That ambition was complicated by Ireland being the inferior side for tracts of the first half, augured by a simple first-minute chance for Bulgaria in which Shane Duffy had to block a Kraev shot in the box.
Their passing was desperately poor at times, sterile and lacking penetration. The only chances Ireland’s passing really created was for Bulgaria. Shane Duffy played an errant square ball to Aleksandar Tsvetkov, with Kevin Long forced to block the shot. Duffy was then the one forced into defensive action, diverting a Dimitar Iliev shot into the arms of Randolph after Jason Knight gave the ball away. 
Ireland’s only real purpose came from the direct running of Ronan Curtis and Daryl Horgan. Curtis gambolled onto a loose ball early in the half and saw a deflected shot narrowly evade James Collins at the back post. Later, Horgan stood up Cicinho and jinked past him before standing up a terrific cross for Collins, who headed over the bar. 
The torment of Ireland’s goalless run was etched all over Stephen Kenny as he twisted away in angst.

Collins also offered Ireland an outlet to hold the ball up that had been missing against England and Wales, and that he came close to scoring from a couple of crosses might have had Mick McCarthy warmly nodding both in vindication and approval from his new home in Cyprus. 
Ireland began the second half with more energy, but it was more heat than light, with a series of moves breaking down in a cymbal-crashing symphony of loose passes, clumsy touches, and reproving looks. 
Their best hope of a goal was through Collins, who hooked an O’Shea cross narrowly wide of the post.
Then, five minutes before the hour mark…the chance.

Knight looks up to find Curtis effectively already through on goal, in a frankly laughable amount of space.
Knight’s pass is good, and Curtis gets his touch right.
He glances at the expanse of goal he has to aim at…he has the whole goal to hit!
He picks his spot.
He steadies himself….and he skews his shot wildly over the crossbar. 
Curtis then glanced hopefully at the ground and found no pardon. 
Ireland have made a habit of conceding goals at the same time in games – twice in three defeats the decisive goal came on the 65-minute mark,  and Bulgaria should have done exactly that here. A corner bounced right across the box to Dimitrov, but the time between his touch and shot allowed Duffy  to throw himself in front of goal and force a corner. 
Josh Cullen was introduced form Horgan and his quick-thinking sent Ireland agonisingly close to The Goal, as he knocked a quick free-kick to Robbie Brady who rattled the crossbar from distance. 
Perhaps the ringing of the crossbar was amplified by the empty stadium, or perhaps it just echoed loudly in this collective nightmare of ours. Cullen was terrific from the moment of his introduction, injecting energy and purpose into the Irish midfield; his first instinct always to pass forward. 
Jack Byrne, meanwhile, came into the fray for the injured Brady, and within moments Ireland came closer still, as a Hourihane cross flashed right across the six-yard box. 
The game collapsed into anarchy in the closing stages with all semblance of team structure absent, but Ireland threw bodies forward – and Troy Parrott onto the pitch – but couldn’t force a goal. 
When might Ireland again score a goal? 
We’d all be forgiven for quoting the raven: nevermore.

Schools are set to shut from tomorrow after the US city recorded a seven-day average positivity rate of three percent.
“We must fight back the second wave of Covid-19,” De Blasio wrote on Twitter.
The three percent threshold had been agreed between the city government and teaching unions when New York’s schools began reopening in September.
New York City is the largest school district in the United States with 1.1 million students.
It has been the only major city in the United States to commit to offering in-person classes this autumn as part of a hybrid system that included online learning.
Many cities, such as Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Miami, opted instead for the virtual model.
However, the closures are controversial with testing showing that schools are not the source of soaring cases.
The positivity rate in schools is just 0.19 percent, Richard Carranza, the head of New York public schools, told principals in an email.
De Blasio’s announcement will see hundreds of thousands of children return to remote learning and leave parents scrambling to make last-minute childcare arrangements.
The mayor had warned of an imminent closure since the end of last week, with parents enduring a daily nervous wait for the latest positivity rate.
They appeared to have been granted another reprieve Wednesday when New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo told reporters that the city’s rolling seven-day average was only 2.5 percent.
Cuomo said New York City could be declared an “orange zone” once it touched three percent, also triggering the shutdown of indoor dining and gyms.
As Cuomo briefed reporters, de Blasio tweeted that the three-percent threshold had been met. He did not immediately provide information on non-essential activities such as gyms.

Earlier today, the worrying news emerged that Dublin Zoo may have to close a result of financial uncertainty brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic.
The revelations came as the zoo – which has been in business for nearly 190 years - launched a fundraising campaign appealing to the Irish public for help.
This evening, it emerged that over €1 million has already been raised.
With the government also pledging to support the zoo, it’ll hopefully be around to see its 200th birthday in ten years’ time.","Here’s your round-up of what made the news today.",1,0,0,19480,"Wed 8:59 PM"

Following concerns raised by the public and politicians, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said that the government would intervene to ensure that Dublin Zoo stays open.
Schwitzer told Morning Ireland today that animal care alone costs €500,000 each month, with the zoo estimating losses of €8.2m in potential revenue so far this year.

The series Emily in Paris is an example of what Kyle Chayka has termed ‘ambient TV’ – shows that you barely even have to look at, but can still follow. While a few of the examples in the piece are specific to America, it might make you look at what you’re binge watching in a new way…

The episodic plots are too thin to ever be confusing; when you glance back up at the television, chances are that you’ll find tracking shots of the Seine or cobblestoned alleyways, lovely but meaningless.

It has been reported that English households could be allowed to mix indoors for a five-day period starting on Christmas Eve – meaning a potential 25-day period of tighter measures into January if such advice was implemented.
The public will need to make “every effort” to keep coronavirus cases low in December in order to gather during the festive season, a Public Health England (PHE) director said.
Dr Susan Hopkins, a senior medical adviser to the UK government’s Covid-19 response, suggested tougher restrictions could be needed either side of Christmas if curbs are to be eased for a time.
She told a Downing Street briefing: “We are very keen that we have a Christmas as close to normal as possible.
That requires all of us to make every effort over this national restriction period and even in early December to get the cases as low as possible and to reduce the risk of transmission within households and between families.
“A final decision will rest with the Government and we look forward to hearing what those plans are.”
At the briefing, she said scientists had suggested that one day of greater freedom required two days of restrictions, but PHE later said Dr Hopkins “misspoke” and that the Sage (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) advice had referred to modelling indicating that for every one day of relaxation, five days of tighter restrictions could be needed.
Dr Hopkins told the briefing: “So coming into Christmas, we need to be very careful about the number of contacts we have to reduce transmission before Christmas and get our cases as low as possible.
“Hopefully the Government will make the decision that will allow us to have some mixing… and once we have got past the Christmas period, if there has been some release and some socialisation, we will all have to be very responsible and reduce those contacts again.”
It comes as ministers work out what new tiers should replace the previous system once England emerges from the current lockdown on 2 December.

Deputy chief scientific adviser Angela McLean told today’s briefing that Sage had been examining a potential relaxation of measures over Christmas.
She said: “We did send some advice in over the weekend, but we genuinely don’t know what decisions have been made.”
Asked whether household mixing could be allowed if there were other trade-offs, McLean said: “What’s really important is we go into a festive week, when we want to mix with our friends and our family, with the number of infections in the community as low as possible.”
She said the number of people testing positive for coronavirus in the community had risen steeply in September and October but had now slowed down.

Some areas with high levels of infection had already started to see a drop before the lockdown was brought in on 5 November, she added.
The latest reproduction rate – the R value – of the virus is still above one, according to most recent estimates, meaning the disease is still spreading.
McLean said it would not be a problem for easing England’s lockdown if the R rate remained above one next week, due to the lag in calculating the value.
But she said an increase in people’s activity on the day before England’s latest lockdown came into effect was a “worry to us”.
Asked whether that was a concern when considering measures ahead of Christmas, she said: “We are concerned about how can we have a safe run-up to Christmas so that we can have some kind of a good family Christmas.”
McLean also said that while admissions to hospital during the March/April lockdown were halving every three weeks, she did not think that would be achieved this time round.","Public Health England director Dr Susan Hopkins said people will have to be ‘very responsible’ and reduce contacts again after Christmas.",3,0,0,18712,"Wed 8:30 PM"

As part of a debate on a Bill on the issue put forward by the Labour Party, Varadkar said the government wants remote working, homeworking and blended working to become part of the new normal based primarily on choice.
“If done right the benefits will be significant in reduced business costs, better work-life balance, more balanced regional development, less traffic, fewer greenhouse gas emissions, and time saved on the commute been used for a better purpose,” he said
However, Varadkar highlighted that surveys indicate that about 10% or 20% of employees are keen to get back to the office as soon as possible.
Another 10% to 20% would like to work from home permanently, he said, while the majority of employees want blended working, working some days in the office and some days at home or some days in a remote hub.
“That is what we should try to strive to facilitate,” he said.
A remote working strategy will be published before the end of the year, he said.
It will include proposals on a network of digital hubs to be built around the country, tax and expenses arrangements to facilitate remote working “to ensure that the cost is borne fairly and benefits shared”, and the right to request working remotely.
There will also be proposals on the right to disconnect, and supports for businesses to make the digital transition.
Burnout
We all know that the overuse of phones and digital devices has been linked to everything from stress, burnout, sleeplessness, as well as to strained personal relationships from that device that is always on and never more than a few metres away, buzzing, flashing and beeping.
“This is an experience that all of us are familiar with given the jobs that we do. Many people admit that they are glued to their phones and laptops late into the evening. This phenomenon predates the pandemic and the creeping intrusion of electronic communications far beyond the normal working day, even into mealtime, is not just about remote working, nor is it new,” he said.
While he said there are clear advantages to flexible working and working remotely, a long-acknowledged potential downside is the expectation that “we are always switched on, always contactable and always available. That is not how it should be”.
Varadkar said a reduction in the intrusion of work-related digital devices after working hours is needed in order to balance workers’ professional and personal lives.. 
He said Ireland also has a comprehensive body of employment legislation including the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, which already sets out maximum working time and minimum rest periods for employees, setting out obligations on employers to ensure that their employees take regular rest breaks and do not work excessive hours. 
Right to disconnect
He said his office is examining the Act in the context of the right to disconnect to consider deficiencies in the law.
A review of the law to give workers the right to disconnect, which gives workers the legal standing to avoid work emails outside working hours, began under former Business Minister, now Social Protection Heather Humphreys. 
The initiative was introduced in France in 2017, mandating companies with more than 50 employees to develop a charter defining employees’ right to switch off and setting out the hours when staff are not supposed to send or answer emails.

Italy, Spain and Belgium have also implemented such legislation.
Tyranny
Speaking on the issue today, Labour’s Brendan Howlin said we always believed technology would come to liberate workers and that technology would get to a point at which we could all have endless leisure.
“The reverse is true. A new tyranny is often imposed by the ability to constantly contact employees and the expectation of bosses that one will respond at any time. That cannot be allowed to continue.  
He said some large technology companies have no one on fixed working hours, stating some are “constant slaves” because they are all permanently logged in and online.  
“Not only was their work being monitored at all times, but it was being benchmarked against all that company’s workers across the globe. They did not even know whether they were doing well or not. We have to come to grips with that sort of tyranny now,” he said. 
Labour’s Working from Home (Covid-19) Bill requires employers to inform employees of their policy on out of hours communications and protects employees from punishment for failing to respond to communications. 
The Bill also requires an employer to pay employees for suitable work equipment and pay them for the costs of working from home including extra utility costs such as electricity, home heating and broadband.","A right to disconnect regulation is also under review.",11,0,4,44454,"Wed 7:38 PM"

525,234,"Interim examiner appointed to Norwegian Air companies",https://www.thejournal.ie/norwegian-air-interim-examiner-5271282-Nov2020/,"THE HIGH COURT has appointed an interim examiner to several companies that are part of the Norwegian Air airline group.
The firms sought the appointment of an examiner due to financial difficulties mainly caused by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the court heard.
The entities granted the protection of the court form their creditors are Arctic Aviation Assets DAC, Norwegian Air International Ltd, Drammensf Jorden Leasing Ltd, Torskef Jorden Leasing Ltd, Lysakerf Jorden Leasing Ltd, which are Irish registered.
The interim examiner was also appointed to its parent company Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, which is Norwegian registered. As well as Ireland the airline has subsidiaries in Spain, the USA, Argentina, Denmark and the UK.
The Irish registered firms are involved in activities including the leasing, management and subleasing of assets, including aircraft, and financing.
At the High Court today Justice Michael Quinn said he was satisfied to appoint experienced insolvency practioner Kieran Wallace as interim examiner.
The Judge said while the firms were insolvent and unable to pay their debts as they fall due, an Independent Experts Report (IAR) presented to court stated that the firms have a reasonable prospect of survival if certain steps are taken.
These include the appointment of an examiner, the full implementation of a restructuring plan, including sourcing additional financing, that would ensure the future survival of the companies.
The judge noted that the IAR stated that creditors, which include aircraft leasing companies and financial lenders, would do better through a successful examinership process compared to if the group was put into liquidation.
The firms’ board of directors petitioned the court for the appointment of an examiner. They hope that Wallace can put together a scheme of arrangement with their creditors, which if approved by the court, will allow them to continue as going concerns.
The groups underlined business is good, the court also heard.
In addition, the companies represented by Brian Kennedy SC and Declan Murphy Bl, say the airline group is encouraged by recent reports about the future availability of a vaccine for Covid-19.
By 2019 the group employed over 10,000 staff and had operated 20 bases in 11 countries.
However last year was difficult for the group and it commenced several cost reduction measures aimed at restoring it to profitability.
Last March the airline was severely impacted by the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. The court heard that since the start of the year the group has seen a fall in passenger number of approximately 78% form the same period in 2019.
Its revenue in the third quarter of 2020 is down by 91% on the same period in 2019. Operating losses had also increased to over €590 million, compared to €149m in 2019.
While the low-cost carrier group has gone into hibernation mode due to the pandemic, it still required cash of €8.4 million per month.

The grounding of Boeing 737 Max and Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft, due to technical difficulties had also adversely affected the airlines finances, the court also heard.
These difficulties, particularly the wholly unprecedented impact of the pandemic and travel restrictions had hit the entire aviation sector.
With the sudden loss of revenue, the group was not capable of complying with its obligations to make repayments to its creditors.
While it had entered into arrangements regarding its debts under a restructuring plan the Norwegian government announced earlier this month that it would no longer provide any more State financial support to the group.
This resulted in several creditors commencing actions against the group.

The corporation said it had approved the appointment of former Supreme Court judge John Dyson to lead the probe, which comes after calls from the late princess’ brother, Charles Spencer.
Spencer has alleged that the flagship ‘Panorama’ programme reporter who conducted the interview, Martin Bashir, showed him faked documents to persuade his sister to take part.
In the November 1995 interview, which was watched by a record 22.8 million people, Princess Diana detailed her collapsing marriage to the heir to the throne.
She famously said “there were three people” in her marriage – her, Charles and his long-time lover Camilla Parker-Bowles – and also revealed she had been unfaithful.
Diana and Charles formally divorced in 1996. She died in a Paris car crash the following year.
New reports have surfaced alleging that Bashir used underhand methods to persuade Diana to talk, including by claiming her own staff members were being paid to spy on her.
“This is an important investigation which I will start straight away,” Dyson said in a statement. “I will ensure it is both thorough and fair.”
The BBC set out the terms of reference for the probe, focusing principally on the role of Bashir, who was little-known at the time but went on to have a global career.
It will consider “the mocked-up bank statements purporting to show payments to a former employee of Earl Spencer… (and) the purported payments to members of the Royal Household”.

It will also look at revelations made by Spencer this month about Bashir to the Daily Mail, which said the reporter made “lurid claims” about Queen Elizabeth II, Charles and other royals.
The entire terms of reference are:
What steps did the BBC and in particular Martin Bashir take with a view to obtaining the Panorama interview on 20 November 1995 with Diana, Princess of Wales? This will involve a consideration of all the relevant evidence including (i) the mocked up bank statements purporting to show payments to a former employee of Earl Spencer (ii) the purported payments to members of the Royal Households; and (iii) the other matters recently raised by Earl Spencer not limited to the matters published in the Daily Mail on 7 November 2020.
Were those steps appropriate, having regard in particular to the BBC’s editorial standards prevailing at the time?
To what extent did the actions of the BBC and in particular Martin Bashir influence Diana, Princess of Wales’s decision to give an interview?
What knowledge did the BBC have in 1995 and 1996 of the relevant evidence referred to at paragraph 1 above?
Having regard to what was known at the time of its investigation in 1995 and 1996, how effectively did the BBC investigate the circumstances leading to the interview?

528,183,"Judicial appointments in the spotlight as Council of Europe says Ireland fails on political influence",https://www.thejournal.ie/judges-council-of-europe-5270647-Nov2020/,"A EUROPEAN ANTI-CORRUPTION watchdog has said that Ireland’s system for appointing judges continues to fail to be free from political influence.
The Group of States Against Corruption (Greco), which is a body established by the Council of Europe, first delivered a report on ethics including judicial appointments in 2014.
It delivered 11 different recommendations for Ireland to follow and, in its latest evaluation published today, found that only five of the recommdations have been implemented.
Among those not implemented is one stating that the system for appointing a promoting judges must be done “in a transparent way, without improper influence from the executive/political powers.”
The publication of the report comes as the government faces questions over the appointment of former Attorney General Seamus Woulfe to the Supreme Court earlier this year. 
Speaking in the Dáil today, Sinn Féin TD Mary Lou McDonald described Woulfe as “a long-term member of Fine Gael” and said that Minister for Justice Helen McEntee was “duty-bound to take questions” on the process that led to his selection. 
Opposition parties have raised concerns about the selection process after it emerged last week that Cabinet was not told in July that a number of other judges had expressed interest in the vacancy on the Supreme Court before Woulfe was selected.
Speaking on the matter last week, the Taoiseach said only one name is brought to Cabinet when a judge is being appointed.
The Greco report published today did not feature an evaluation of the appointment process in the case of Woulfe, but was an evaluation of the system in general. 
The report was critical of the practice of not ranking potential candidates presented to government to become judges. 
It was not critical of the pre-selection process put in place by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board (JAAB) but said that the seven names being forwarded should be prioritised to reduce potential political influence. 
Greco also makes numerous references to the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill, which was championed by former minister Shane Ross but which was not passed by the Seanad and has since lapsed.

The report stated that the proposal contained in the bill to create a commission to appoint judges that would have a lay majority and a lay chairperson was also problematic.
It stated that making the commission answerable to parliament would have also risked having “improper influence from the executive/political power over the appointment process”. 
Ross has been an outspoken critic of the process for selecting judges in this country, writing preciously in TheJournal.ie that the process is “too close to politicians and to the judiciary itself”.  
Speaking yesterday, Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín said that the judges and politics have been “interwoven for far too long”. 
“Irish people know more about the selection of Supreme Court Judges in the US than in Ireland,” he said.
“Many people look down their noses at the political nature of the system in the US while ignoring the political wheeling and dealing that goes into the selection process in Ireland.”","A new report comes as the government faces ongoing questions over the Seamus Woulfe affair.",163,0,0,28912,"Wed 6:13 PM"

The Department of Health confirmed this evening that a further 12 people have died, bringing the total number of deaths to 2,006. 
The Department also confirmed 379 additional cases of Covid-19 in Ireland, bringing the total number of cases to 69,058.
Commenting on the milestone of 2,000 deaths being reached, Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan noted how much the pandemic has impacted on families and communities across the country.
“It is important that we continue to work together if we are to suppress this virus and protect as many people as possible,” Holohan said.
“For the next two weeks, work from home, stay at home and follow public health advice.”
2,000 deaths 
This evening’s sobering milestone comes following an increase in deaths of people diagnosed with coronavirus in recent months as Ireland copes with the second wave of the pandemic. 
The first death of a person diagnosed with Covid-19 – of a woman in the east of the country – was confirmed on 11 March, the same day the World Health Organization (WHO) classified Covid-19 as a pandemic. 
The number of cases and deaths grew exponentially as the virus spread across Ireland in the early spring.
By 1 June, 1,650 people had lost their lives to Covid-19.
Restrictions at the time meant that many family members, friends and loved ones could not properly celebrate the lives of those they had lost. 
Lifting lockdown
The strictest public health measures were eased from late May, and the spread of the virus was suppressed.
The number of deaths from Covid-19 in Ireland also started to decrease rapidly as a result. No more than nine deaths were recorded across the whole of August. 
But even during that month cases were increasing again -  reaching a record high on 18 October when 1,283 cases were reported.
The number of deaths initially remained low, and additional ‘lockdown’ measures introduced in recent months have been credited by health officials with keeping enough capacity in the health system to successfully treat severe cases. 
HSE Chief Clinical Officer Dr Colm Henry said the decreased mortality rate in Ireland matches similar patterns observed across Europe. 
In March and April, when Ireland’s testing and tracing programme was only beginning, the positivity rate of people coming forward for tests was 25% whereas it currently stands at 4%, said Dr Henry.
In other words, the virus was far more widespread at that time. 
“In addition, there was a bias towards testing older people,” Dr Henry told TheJournal.ie. As the health system mobilised to add capacity in the early days and weeks of the pandemic, tests could only be provided to those in vulnerable groups who were also showing symptoms of the disease. 
As the HSE raced to stem the spread of Covid-19, nursing homes were particularly vulnerable, resulting in the deaths of many older people across Ireland. 
The elderly and those with underlying health conditions are more vulnerable to the virus than most. Data released by the Central Statistics Office in May showed that almost 92% of confirmed Covid-19 deaths occurred in people aged over 65. 
“The other thing now is that older people are protecting themselves more and they’ll probably be protected more too,” said Dr Henry. 
In addition, improved treatments such as antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs have been increasingly used to treat people, including the elderly, who contract Covid-19.

Daily figures 
The daily number of deaths from Covid-19 announced each day during the pandemic does not mean the deaths occurred on that particular day. 
There is often a lag in confirming mortality as a result of the virus. In the early days of Covid-19, public health officials urged family members to report their loved ones deaths as early as possible so that health services could better understand the effects of the virus and gain a more accurate picture of mortality.
Members of NPHET have sounded warnings in recent days as the number of cases and mortality rates have increased. 
There were 36 deaths from Covid-19 in September and 119 in October. So far this month, 75 people have died from the virus.
“We are concerned the positive trajectory we had has at best stalled and is in fact deteriorating,” Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Ronan Glynn said earlier this week.
He added that there was only a short time “to turn this around” by focusing on the basic public health messages of social distancing, hand-washing and wearing a face covering. 
The Government announced earlier this year that national and local events to commemorate those we have lost during Covid-19 will take place in the near future. 
Collaborating with the media, civil society organisations and church groups on the approach and timing, it is expected these events will take place at some point next year.

HEALTH MINISTER STEPHEN Donnolly has said if people do need to travel home to see their family this Christmas they should follow the rules set out under the EU traffic light travel plan.
The issue of travel around Christmas has dominated the headlines in recent weeks.
Speaking to Newstalk’s Pat Kenny, the health minister said there are two different parts to the government advice around international travel and Christmas, which he believes the public understand.
“The first part of the message is we’re in the middle of the biggest pandemic in 100 years… so the public health advice is if you don’t have to travel… in the middle of a global pandemic, which is causing so much hurt and pain and cost for everybody, then don’t.”
“The second part of the message is, however, if you do need to travel, and that includes if you haven’t seen your family, and if you do need to come home and see your family at Christmas, then there is a clear traffic light system in place with protocols you need to follow,” said Donnelly.
“I think that is a pretty common sense approach,” he said.
Under the new EU traffic light plan, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control publishes a weekly map of the EU using a three-stage colour system to indicate the level of risk in each area.
Levels are determined by a variety of epidemiological factors including the 14-day incidence per 100,000 population and the level of positive tests.
Ireland signed up to the plan in October.
From midnight on 29 November, travellers arriving into Ireland from so-called ‘red’ regions in the new traffic light system will be advised that they no longer need to restrict their movements once they pass a Covid-19 PCR test (usually a nasal swab) five days following their arrival here.
Travellers arriving from orange regions do not have to restrict their movements if they carry the results of a negative Covid-19 test taken at least three days before their arrival.
Those who do not have a negative test upon arrival in Ireland can have a test taken five days after their arrival. 
Passengers will be asked to restrict their movements until they get the test.
Earlier in the Dáil, the Taoiseach said the government is currently preparing the plan to exit Level 5 restrictions, and that will include travel.
He said travel does pose risks, but said it is about “how we manage risks and peoples’ behaviours”.
The issue of rapid testing, and its use in terms of travel, was also raised in the Dail today with the Taoiseach.
Sinn Fein Mary Lou McDonald highlighted how the the Irish Airlines Pilots Association has called for rapid testing to be used for those arriving and departing at Irish airports, stating that it seems to be a “matter of common sense”. 
She asked why there hasn’t been a comprehensive comparison of the different tests and how they can be used in each setting.
McDonald accused the Taoiseach of having a “hands off” approach when it comes to the issue of Christmas travel, stating that testing at airports and ports is “obviously necessary and a priority matter”.

Confused by the current travel advice? You're not alone. Here's everything you need to know right now
Her comments come after there were calls today for the government to align its testing regime with today’s European Commission recommendation on the use of rapid antigen testing in certain settings.
The recommendation provides guidance on how to select rapid antigen testing systems, when they are appropriate and who should perform them, said the Fianna Fail MEP  Billy Kelleher.
The Commission has recommended that in order to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 in healthcare and social-care settings, rapid antigen tests – which can deliver results in about an hour – should be considered at admission to healthcare facilities, as well as for triage of symptomatic patients or residents.
In high prevalence situations or where PCR testing capacity is limited, rapid antigen tests use should be considered for recurring testing (every 2-3 days) of staff of health-care, home and social care, other long-term care facilities, closed settings, such as prisons, detention centres, and other reception infrastructures for asylum seekers
and migrants, it states.
Rapid anitgen testing should also be used on relevant frontline workers in sectors such a meat processing, plants, slaughterhouses, and other similar settings.
Travel
Today’s recommendation also states the possibility to use rapid antigen tests for passengers travelling abroad might be further considered.
Taking into account the latest scientific and technological developments in light of the
epidemiological situation, the Commission states that the ECDC and the
European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) are jointly developing a protocol for
safer air travel, including the establishment of a common testing approach at airports.
Kelleher said scientific advances in the area of testing have changed our understanding of the virus, and these advances should therefore inform how we view different testing and diagnostic procedures.
While he said the PCR test should be used where possible, due to the time taken to get a result using PCR testing, there may be benefit in looking for a testing system that delivers quicker results especially in emergency or in point-of-care scenarios such as the health sector or in nursing homes.
“A critical aspect of dealing with testing, and the wider Covid 19 response, is coordination at European Union level. Cross-border movement will eventually start to return to normal. We should agree to mutually recognise test results where certain scientific and diagnostic standards are met,” said Kelleher.

The Taoiseach told the Dáil that the public health authorities “are not are not convinced about the efficacy of rapid testing, or antigen testing”.
He said it was “no mystery” as that has been the position of Irish public health experts ”since the get go” of the pandemic.
Co-ordinated approach across Europe
He said the issue of a co-ordinated approach to testing will be discussed at a European leader Council meeting tomorrow, but said there was “no definitive European wide approach to antigen testing or rapid testing” 
He confirmed that the The National Virus Reference Laboratory (NVRL) is currently carrying out a validation process on LAMP testing, while the National Public Health Emergency Team, (NPHET) is validating community antigen testing. 
The LAMP test uses a throat and nose swab and differs from a PCR test, which is used by the HSE to detect the presence of Covid-19 at its test centres around the country. The LAMP test can be processed quickly without being sent to a laboratory.
Currently, the only validated test recognised in Ireland is the PCR test. After someone is swabbed, the PCR test has to be sent to a lab for analysis.

AS HE LEFT the O’Moore Park pitch on a mid-summer afternoon in 2018, the embarrassment hit home for Ian Maguire.
The present is about Munster final preparation and savouring their seismic win over Kerry.
But the past is still easily recalled by the Cork captain, a reminder that if that recent November night represented a joyous breakthrough against their arch-rivals, their hopes of recovery looked particularly bleak a couple of years ago when they were crushed by 17 points by Tyrone.
“I’ve two lasting memories, of 2018. The Kerry game, obviously that just didn’t go to plan, we got beaten by a better team there. You’re going into a big game and you just feel inferior.
“I think against Tyrone I thought we were going to bounce back and we’d give it a battle. They had a plan and they beat us off the park.
“I remember I met Fintan Goold walking off, a player who I played with and the first person I roomed with when I was playing against Mayo in 2014. He said something like, ‘Just keep the head up’, to me and I looked down at the floor. It was, like, I’m embarrassed, I can’t even look at you.
“That’s my one memory that I’m always going to be, like, don’t let that happen again.
“Because I thought in 2018 where are we going from here after getting absolutely man-handled by Tyrone? They were obviously laughing at us walking off the pitch.”
Ian Maguire in action against Padraig Hampsey in 2018.
Ten days ago the post-match emotions were vastly different as Maguire mingled with his team-mates
“When you play bad sometimes you deserve the criticism you get and over the last couple of years we’ve lost games in a bad manner and we’ve lost some close games.
“The greatest thing about Sunday was we all warming down after and were together and we were chatting and talking about the good things in the game. I don’t know how many times we have warmed down and it’s just you’re deflated, trying to get fellas to bounce back straight away.
“The other day was enjoying the moment and soaking in the moment with your team-mates. Even Monday, Tuesday, you were still chatting with fellas on the team and we went training and you’re still soaking in the moment.”
When Cork snatched victory from Kerry’s grasp, Maguire was sitting in the South Stand. He had come off in the 76th minute of a gruelling, energy-sapping encounter. The closing tense passages of play unfolded in front of him, grabbing a draw was the main scenario he was contemplating.
“Luke put down the ball for the free first and I was like, ‘Well, if anyone is going to slot this free it’s this fella’. He stepped up anyway, not a bother, didn’t even think two seconds about it. When Sean Meehan made the run through first, I was convinced there was a ball on the loop but it never happened. He probably made the right decision not to shoot because he was on his right leg and he would have been shooting under pressure with a Kerry defender coming on his right leg.
“But when the ball came back to Luke I knew straight away that he was going to shoot this. That’s the beauty of Luke Connolly, he doesn’t need to be asked twice if he wants to take a shot or not. He’s claiming it was a pass but it was a shot!
“Then you could see the ball coming down and you were thinking, ‘Aw, no.’ I knew Mark Keane was in there. Then I just saw the flag fly out of the goal.
“RTÉ didn’t show, but whether it was right or wrong the whole bench, Ronan, Cian everyone ran straight onto the pitch, jumping up and down. The linesman had a heart attack. We didn’t know whether it was full time or not. The linesman then ushered us off and the full-time whistle went.
“To be fair, it was a surreal moment because it was a mixture of ‘I think we’re going to get a draw’ to ‘oh no, here we go again, another one of those days. WTF’.”

The late shows of composure, skill and luck that put Cork and Tipperary close to Munster glory
Maguire celebrates Cork's victory with Kevin O'Driscoll.

Maguire’s seven seasons in the Cork senior ranks have been packed with near misses when Cork have faced off against a top-tier team. His first year in 2014 ended with a one-point loss to Mayo. A back injury wrecked his involvement in 2015, then he suffered defeats by three points to Donegal in 2016, a point short against Mayo a year later and then another three-point reversal to Kerry in last year’s Munster final.
“We were kind of labelled ‘nearly men’, which is the worst possible thing you could nearly be called as a player or as a team. These are still conversations I’ve had with my own club-mate Shieldsy, where I would have spoke like how do we keep missing getting over the line? It was hard to put your finger on it.
“I think Ronan touched on it in ’15 and ’17 and even the game the last day, I thought personally we showed periods of dominance but we never put teams away. I thought our game management last Sunday was as good as it was in any other game.
“Does it come down to experience? Is it the extra strength and conditioning? Is it the extra coaching from Cian O’Neill or maybe is it the mentality we kind of built on from, say the Super 8s that we are good enough, that got us over the line. I think they’re all factors that you kind of need to rely on.
“Coming off that pitch, perceiving ourselves as a better team to be honest and getting a victory like that, it was nice.”
The 26-year-old was conscious as well of those outside their playing group.
“My mother and father were delighted because they’re sick of seeing me sulk after games. As a player, you can get self-centred at times that when you lose or when you play bad. When you’re involved in a set-up you don’t think of other people involved. After that game, I was thinking of Frank Cogan, the masseuse who has been with Cork forever, Dr Con, Aidan Kelleher, Coli Lane, Brian O’Connell who has been involved as well.
“You’re thinking about those who have been helping you out for years with injuries and even just your personal form or doing you favours to get right for matches or doing favours in your personal life. It was just a nice moment because I think we’ve all been affected by poor performances or even underachieving.”
Knocking out Kerry was one objective achieved, backing up with a success over Tipperary next Sunday is their next task. They are familiar opponents, stretching back to Maguire’s underage career with a minor semi-final loss in 2012 followed by a trio of provincial U21 finals.

This will be the fourth championship meeting in five seasons between the teams, they have got acquainted as well through clashes in the last three league campaigns.
“I feel like I’ve been playing against Stephen O’Brien, Tipp’s midfielder, every year since 2011 whether it was underage, minor or U21. And a lot of those Tipperary players are around my age funny enough. Jimmy Feehan another fella, Bill Maher. I played with Jack Kennedy in college and Michael Quinlivan.
“David Power was the main man when it was my age with the minors. So they’re well organised, they’ve top players and are a very physical team. They have real talent going forward and we know what’s ahead of us.”
The inter-county focus has been a welcome tonic for Maguire. Over a month ago his club efforts ended in disappointment, St Finbarr’s losing a county senior semi-final after a dramatic penalty shootout.
“After that crappy loss now, it was bad, but to get back in Tuesday and Thursday, and the beauty of this team is that some of those lads I hadn’t seen in weeks so it was a great opportunity to meet up and talk to them again.
“It was a tough loss, funnily enough another tight game that I’ve lost, shocker. I couldn’t make it right with my club but at least I made it right with my county in a way.
“I’ll tell you what, Mark Collins has missed about four penalties in training since after sticking two against us!
“Obviously I think (Séan) Powter touched on it in his interview after the game how much love he has for Cork football and I think he spoke for every player. Sport is a great distractor in strange times like this. At least we have an opportunity to go out three times a week and take an emotional break from Covid.”

The 58-year-old has been unable to take up bail since he was charged seven weeks ago with 17 offences, in Ireland and outside the State, from 2014 to 2017.
He was arrested at his home at Adelaide Street, Dun Laoghaire, Co Dublin.
Conditional bail was set on 1 October last in his own bond of €500 with a requirement for a €10,000 independent surety.
Creaven, who remains in custody, faced his fourth hearing when he appeared at Cloverhill District Court today.
Detective Garda Johanna Doyle, who is attached to the Online Child Exploitation Unit, served a book of evidence on him.
The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) directed that he is to face trial on indictment.
Judge Victor Blake acceded to a request from State solicitor Michelle Sheerin to make minor amendments to some charges.
The DPP consented to Creaven being returned for trial, Sheerin said.
Judge Blake told the former broadcaster that he must notify the prosecution within 14 days if he intends to use an alibi in his defence.
Creaven said “yes” when asked if he understood.
Judge Blake granted the order sending him forward for trial on the 17 charges in the book of evidence, to the next sittings of the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court, on 21 January next.
Creaven remains in custody with consent to bail and the State agreed to him going forward to the Circuit Court on the same terms.
The accused consulted quietly with his barrister Sharon Rossiter, instructed by solicitor Michael Staines, during the hearing.
However, he has not yet indicated how he will plead.
His barrister’s application for legal aid, to include representation of junior and senior counsel for the defence, was granted after the judge noted the State had no objection.

An order for disclosure of the videos of interviews was also made.
Creaven’s charges are:
Two counts of sexual assault of a child outside the State in 2014
Three counts of sexual exploitation of a child outside the State in 2014
Three counts of sexually exploiting a child in Ireland in 2017
Five counts of possessing child pornography in 2017
Four counts of using IT and communication technology for the purpose of facilitating child sexual exploitation, inside and outside of the State in 2017.
Some of the charges carry a possible sentence of life imprisonment.
At his first hearing, Detective Garda Doyle said it was alleged a search was carried out at Creaven’s home in November 2017.
The district court had heard it could be difficult for him to find someone to act as a surety.
Judge Blake said if bail is taken up, he must sign on daily at a Garda station from 9am to 9pm.
He must “not use any social media platform, in particular Facebook and Skype”.
He would have to surrender his passport within 48 hours of taking up bail, notify Gardaí of any change of address, and be contactable by mobile phone.","Creaven has not yet indicated how he will plead.",36,0,0,49537,"Nov 18th 2020, 4:02 PM"

After a legal battle lasting four years and more than a decade of abuse Cora Desmond finally secured justice yesterday when Bridget Kenneally (49) of Duncoran in Youghal, Co Cork, was jailed for two years.
Cora opened up about the abuse she suffered at the hands of her step-mother today and urged victims of violence not to believe their attacker’s threats and to seek help as soon as possible.
Cora’s father married Kenneally when she was just six-years-old and, after a brief period of kindness at the beginning of the relationship, Cora said her step-mother quickly turned to “pure evil”.
Kenneally began physically and emotionally abusing Cora within six months and it continued for more than 10 years until she escaped aged 16.
The now 21-year-old told the Neil Prendeville Show on Cork’s RedFM that she and her sister were prevented from having friends and were forced to act as cleaners for her step-mother and her children. 
“Her kids lived their daily life with their friends and did what they wanted to do and for us it was just: get up, clean after her kids and wait for the next beating,” Cora said.
Kenneally also called her ‘Cora Ella’, like Cinderella, because she said she wasn’t wanted in the house. “She felt joy in calling me Cora Ella because she knew it tormented me. She knew I hated it. It was, kind of, a power thing for her,” she explained.
The attacks got worse as Cora got older and Kenneally began regularly beating her with a range of objects including a sweeping brush and a fire poker. The beatings became so frequent that Cora even stopped pleading with her step-mother to stop the violence:
There was no point in begging her to stop because the more I asked her to stop, the more I cried, the more she beat me. She was punishing me for feeling pain.
During one of the incidents Kenneally twisted Cora’s hand so much that she broke a bone in her thumb.
“She got so angry, she grabbed my hand and started twisting my hand and my fingers and it eventually just snapped my thumb. And she told me to tell doctors and anybody who asked that I fell out in her back garden,” Cora said.
Another attack left Cora hospitalised for a week with a range of injuries including significant bruising to her head and dozens of bruises to her body.
Her fear of her step-mother was so great that she always stuck to what she was told to say when questions were asked about her injuries.
I was living in such fear. It was constant fear. I knew that if I spoke up that it wouldn’t end well for me, because she would always threaten that I would be taken away from my sister and my dad. As a child you don’t want to go into foster care. You don’t want to be separated from your family.
Cora’s daily routine involved scrubbing the kitchen, bathroom or another part of the house before she left for school. If she didn’t do this it would result in another attack.
School was her only sanctuary and after she returned home another battery of cleaning chores had to be carried out by her and her sister.
“Her kids would come home, have their dinner plated up for them, have their washing put away for them, their rooms scrubbed for them and it was basically all done by us. Me and my sister. It was constant running around after them,” she revealed.
After sustaining years of abuse, Cora eventually managed to find light at the end of the tunnel after she broke down during a conversation with her mother.
Learning about the horrific situation left her mother distraught and within a week Cora had an appointment with gardaí to make a statement about the abuse.
That sparked a lengthy investigation which dragged on for four years and left Cora in doubt about justice ever being served.
“I started to believe that I wasted my time, wasted the guards’ time in reporting it because it had been going on for so long, just waiting and waiting and waiting to find out what was going to happen,” she explained. 
My family always tried to boost me up and keep telling me ‘one day. one day. Keep looking forward. You’re going to get justice.’ If it wasn’t for them I wouldn’t be here today.
Cora’s father seperated from Kenneally when gardaí contacted him to inform him about Cora’s statement. She told Prendeville that he feels immmense guilt about never realising what his daughters were being subjected to. 
During the court case Kenneally issued an apology to Cora. When asked by the judge whether she felt the apology was genuine, Cora said she didn’t believe that Kenneally was remorseful for her actions.

SUPPORT US NOW
“It might sound cruel of me to not accept this apology but, at the end of the day, I know her,” Cora explained on the radio show.
I lived with her for 11 years of my life. I know her mind games, I know the way she is. I know that she’s only apologising now because it’s gotten as severe as it has.
Cora said she was shocked when Kenneally received a custodial sentence as she had expected her to escape with only community service.
“We’d been waiting so long that we thought she was going to walk away with a slap on the wrist,” she said. “We never thought that she would end up locked-up and not able to cause harm to another child.”
Cora said she has worked hard to overcome her horrific childhood and is now in a “great place”. 
“I’ve worked hard in the last four and a half years with counsellors and doctors and my family and friends to get to where I am and be somewhat happy and enjoying life,” she said.
Obviously as a 21-year-old there’s stresses and responsibilities but I never pictured myself making it this far. 
The survivor told victims that people will believe them if they come forward and report a violent person.
“Anybody that is going through something, or was going through something, should speak out as soon as possible and get help with your mental health or help to escape from a violent person,” she urged.
Just speak out and tell someone because you never know when it’s going to be too late. Don’t listen to the threats. You will be believed.
“That was one of my biggest fears when I was reporting my incident. I realised not long after that she’s the one that wasn’t believed. I had people fighting in my corner.
“People who I didn’t know. People who I’d never heard of, never met. It just shows that there are good people out there who will help you.”","Cora Desmond has spoken about the abuse she suffered at the hands of Bridget Kenneally.",58,0,0,26782,"Nov 18th 2020, 2:51 PM"

Geraghty, who captained Meath to All-Ireland glory in 1999, was recently hospitalised and underwent a seven-hour operation after suffering a brain haemorrhage. 
The news of his sudden illness rocked the GAA community, with his wife Amanda since revealing that he is “doing well” and facing a “long road” ahead. The two-time All-Star has since reportedly returned home and is expected to make a full recovery. 
Giles and Geraghty soldiered together on that great Royals team of the 90s, achieving All-Ireland success in 1996 as well as that triumph in ’99. 
“It really stopped me in my tracks when I got a phone call from one of the lads to say, ‘Did you hear about Graham?’” says Giles when asked about his former team-mate.
He’s kind of a bit of an indestructible fella. He’s had belts and bangs over the years, the odd suspension and controversy. It kind of takes nothing out of him, he just bounces back. He doesn’t overthink it too much and just gets on with things.
“Seven hours [in] surgery is huge and he came through it which is great. He gets home after two weeks, obviously doing really well. I’m sure there’s things that have to improve for him in the next few weeks to make that full recovery.”
Giles added that he hasn’t spoken to Geraghty yet as he wants to give him some time to focus on his rehabilitation, but says they have been in contact since his operation.
“I sent him a text last Friday to say, ‘Heard you’re doing great, keep it up.’ He replied straight away to say he was doing well, the doctors were happy and he was getting home last Friday.
“When someone replies to you in a text straight away, you kind of think, ‘Ah sure he’s grand, back to normal.’ I’m sure he’s not back to normal just yet but no better man for something like to recover from.”
Giles and Geraghty have always kept in touch over the years since the end of their respective careers. They both played influential roles during their time in a Meath jersey and there have often been incidents of people mixing the two up.
Giles admits that he sometimes has to correct others who mistakenly address him as Geraghty.

“It happens the odd time in Dublin that a fella might come up to me and say, ‘Geraghty, you think you’re fairly tough now, do ya?’”
Giles says the last time he was in Geraghty’s company was at an Oscars fundraising event last year, which was held by the Kilmessan hurling club. The pair teamed up to play out roles from the famous Hollywood movie Forrest Gump.
“Myself and Graham did a little cameo for them,” he explains. “The two of us were standing out in a field last year in Kilmessan, there was a group of hurlers pucking about on a muddy field and Forrest Gump was running out on the pitch.
He had to say, ‘Who the hell is that?’ And I had to say, ‘Well, that’s Forrest Gump, coach!’ We had a great bit of craic and then we had to go into a wood in Kilmessan in our army gear and black paint under our eyes for a scene from one of the Vietnam parts of Forrest Gump.”
Geraghty’s illness triggered a huge reaction among GAA people in Meath and beyond. Several high profile figures in the sport posted messages of support on social media in the hours after he was taken to hospital, and there was widespread relief after his successful operation. 
Giles says it was no surprise to see such an outpouring of emotion for such a great sporting icon.
“I suppose anyone who played with him or against him, they just knew how fast he was, how fit he was and thought he was indestructible. When something like that happens, it brings out the best in people which is great to see.”

BAM, THE PRIMARY contractor building the new National Children’s Hospital, has submitted claims for extra costs running “in excess of €200 million”, the Oireachtas Health Committee was told today. 
Chief Officer of of National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) David Gunning said that this amount was in relation to “over 600 claims” but that the board was defending these claims. 
“Where we feel there is no entitlement, we are using all mechanisms available in the contract to defend these claims and to protect the public purse,” he said. 
TDs and Senators were being briefed on the status of the massive project today and heard that the project is delayed again.
The scheduled competition date for the project was originally set for August 2022 and was six months behind schedule before Covid-19.
Gunning said that there were seven weeks where Covid-19 restrictions stopped works and a further seven weeks thereafter where BAM did not return to the site. 
He said this gives a “clear indication” of the overall delay in the projected but he was reluctant to give an updated completion date and that this was partly due to BAM not providing a work programme.  
Gunning said that an updated completion date would be provided early next year. 
Pushed by a number of TDs, Gunning said that the “working assumption” on the completion date is the “contract timelines” and that that would remain the case “until such time as we change that programme”. 
“I anticipate we will be working with the contractor and providing updated guidance to stakeholders on schedule in early next year, that is the position,” he said.

In response, Social Democrats TD Roisín Shortall said that “board is delusional” it is working off the original date and that this is “not acceptable”. 
On the overall cost of the project, Gunning said that the NPHDB was working within the scope of the €1.43 billion budget but that there is “considerable pressure” on that estimate. 
The project was originally expected to cost €983 million in 2017 but this increased to €1.4 billion in 2018 and there have been suggestions that the overall cost may now be above €2 billion. 
“The approved budget is €1.43 billion, and we are currently operating within that budgetary scope. However, I think it’s fair to say that there are considerable pressures on that particular budget,” he said. 
Gunning went on to say that the primary pressure on the budget was due to ongoing delays in the project and that this was “problematic”.  ","The completion date for the project is also being pushed back further.",125,0,1,60854,"Nov 18th 2020, 11:06 AM"

America’s air safety agency announced the move today, saying it was made after a comprehensive and methodical 20-month review process.
Regulators around the world grounded the Max in March 2019 after the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jet, which happened less than five months after another Max flown by Indonesia’s Lion Air plunged into the Java Sea.
A total of 346 passengers and crew members on both planes were killed.
The planes will not return to the skies immediately as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) says it must approve pilot training changes for each US airline and airlines must perform required maintenance on the planes.
The FAA says the move was made in cooperation with air safety regulators worldwide.
“Those regulators have indicated that Boeing’s design changes, together with the changes to crew procedures and training enhancements, will give them the confidence to validate the aircraft as safe to fly in their respective countries and regions,” the FAA said in a statement.
Congressional hearings
The move came after numerous US congressional hearings on the crashes that led to criticism of the FAA for lax oversight and Boeing for rushing to implement a new software system that put profits over safety and ultimately led to the dismissal of its chief executive.
Investigators focused on anti-stall software that Boeing had devised to counter the plane’s tendency to tilt nose-up because of the size and placement of the engines. That software pushed the nose down repeatedly on both planes that crashed, overcoming the pilots’ struggles to regain control. In each case, a single faulty sensor triggered the nose-down pitch.
The FAA required Boeing to change the software so it does not repeatedly point the nose of the plane down to counteract possible aerodynamic stalling. Boeing says the software also does not override the pilot’s controls like it did in the past. Boeing also must install new display systems for pilots and change the way wires are routed to a tail stabiliser bar.

Boeing sales
Boeing sales of new planes have plunged because of the Max crisis and the coronavirus pandemic. Orders for more than 1,000 Max jets have been cancelled or removed from Boeing’s backlog this year.
American Airlines is the only US airline to put the Max back in its schedule so far, starting with one round trip daily between New York and Miami beginning on 29 December.
Nearly 400 Max jets were in service worldwide when they were grounded, and Boeing has built and stored about 450 more since then. All have to undergo maintenance and get some modifications before they can fly.

Pilots must also undergo simulator training, which was not required when the aircraft was introduced.
Boeing’s then-chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, initially suggested that the pilots were to blame. However, congressional investigators discovered an FAA analysis — conducted after the first Max crash — that predicted there would be 15 more crashes during the plane’s lifespan if the flight-control software were not fixed.
After an 18-month investigation, the House Transportation Committee heaped blame on Boeing – which was under pressure to develop the Max to compete with a plane from European rival Airbus – and the FAA, which certified the Max and was the last agency in the world to ground it after the crashes.
The investigators said Boeing suffered from a “culture of concealment” and pressured engineers in a rush to get the plane on the market.
Boeing was repeatedly wrong about how quickly it could fix the plane and when those predictions continued to be wrong, and Boeing was perceived as putting undue pressure on the FAA, Mr Muilenburg was dismissed in December 2019.
In recent weeks, European regulators have signalled their likely approval of Boeing’s work, while regulators in Canada and China are still conducting their own reviews.","American Airlines plans to have the 737 Max back in the air before the end of the year.",5,0,0,15076,"Nov 18th 2020, 1:58 PM"

Questions have been raised about the process by which Woulfe, who is facing calls to resign from the Chief Justice over his attendance at the Golfgate dinner, was appointed by the Cabinet last summer.
The Opposition have called on the justice minister to answer Dáil questions after it emerged that three serving judges wrote to the government expressing an interest in the vacancy earlier this year. 
McDonald said today that it “stinks to the highest heavens” that government is blocking Dáil questions to McEntee.
The Sinn Féin leader said McDonald said McEntee needs to outline the events between 27 June and 16 July that led to the four names for the Supreme Court vacancy becoming one. 
McDonald accused the government of “circling the wagons” referring to Minister for Arts Catherine Martin stating today that it “would set a dangerous precedent” if the justice minister was obliged to answer Dáil questions on the appointment of a Supreme Court judge.
The deputy Green Party leader said it would be “unprecedented” to do so, but she called for more transparency in the appointments process.
She told RTE’s Morning Ireland: “I would fear there would be a risk there, it’s unprecedented for a minister of justice to be brought before the Dail to answer questions on judicial appointments like that.
“I believe it would set a dangerous precedent to go into such detail on an individual appointment. I don’t believe that would serve the separation of powers well.
“There needs to be more consistency and transparency with this process. Reform is needed. The Green Party would be seeking more transparency in relation to this.”

Golfgate: Woulfe resignation from Supreme Court would be 'unjust and disproportionate' - Denham report
The argument it jeopardises the separation of powers is “utter nonsense”, said McDonald in the Dáil today.
The Taoiseach said he doesn’t believe politicians should be embroiled in discussions about who should be a judge and who shouldn’t be a judge. When he learned the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board (JAAB) process deemed Woulfe was suitable “that was good enough for me”.
The appointment process of the Attorney General was central to the “horse trading” in government formation talks and in relation to the appointment of the current Attorney General Paul Gallagher, said McDonald.
The decision to appoint the AG on a rotating basis, similar to the role of Taoiseach in this Government, was “central to your horse trading”, she said.
Micheal Martin rejected allegations of “horse trading”, stating it was “historic precedent” that the Attorney General is appointed by the Taoiseach of the day.
He accused Sinn Fein of creating a false narrative around the appointment of Woulfe, and for this reason he felt Minister McEntee should not appear before the Dail.

Naomi Long described “huge uncertainty” for justice agencies with just weeks to go until the end of the transition period.
She singled out extradition as a particular area of concern, telling a Westminster committee that the justice system could be left using 1950s mechanisms for extradition.
“We can’t combat 2020 crime and security threats using 1950 tools,” she said.
The Northern Ireland Affairs Committee previously heard that instead of six to eight weeks under the European Arrest Warrant, extradition could take up to two years.
Giving evidence to the committee today, Long said it is “imperative” that the UK and EU agree a future security partnership.
“However even if they do, it will not have the same breadth of measures to which we currently have access, the outcome will be sub-optimal unless we have the same access to current IT systems, legal instruments and EU agencies that we currently enjoy,” she told MPs.
“We cannot really afford to lose those key EU measures, if we – tragically in my view – exit without a deal then it is imperative that bilateral arrangements are put in place to bridge any gaps in capability.
“There is huge uncertainty for justice partners, there are only weeks to go until the end of the transition period yet we do not know what beyond that will look like.
“Planning can only go so far in that context. We do now urgently need detail on the outcome of the negotiations and clarity, in particular as to how the Northern Ireland Protocol will be implemented in practice to try to embed a culture of compliance and a culture of lawfulness.”
Long said anything less than a good security partnership between the UK and EU, or a substantial bilateral agreement between the UK and Ireland, would be a “failure of policy making and negotiation”.

‘Politically disturbed’
Long also raised the potential for unrest if people are “politically disturbed” by the outcomes of Brexit, as well as potential for the expansion of black market activity in a scenario of different tariffs on either side of the border.

She said:
It isn’t just the future security partnership that affects policing and justice in Northern Ireland, it is also the economic decisions that are made because if we have increased differentials in terms of tariffs and other issues around the border, then we will end up with a potential bonanza for organised crime.
DUP MP Ian Paisley queried if Long’s department had a “can-do” attitude towards Brexit planning.
She responded saying it is for the UK government to have a can-do attitude in the negotiations with the EU.
“If we’re not able to data share, we are not able to do our jobs on a cross-border basis. Optimism will take you so far but unfortunately you can’t cash cheques on that basis… I am not going to try to gloss over the difficulties that this will create, the challenges it poses to law enforcement because that is not my job, my job is to respond to the reality.”
Joe Biden
DUP MP Gregory Campbell asked Long if she has reached out to US President-elect Joe Biden, and suggested she advise the US consul that the new administration “treads very carefully” around Northern Ireland politics.
He referenced a photograph of Biden with former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams and veteran republican Rita O’Hare which he said “a lot of people would have taken deep offence” at.
Long said there is “nothing new” in US presidents being pictured with high-profile Irish republicans and others, adding there are photographs of President Donald Trump at a fundraiser for Sinn Féin in the US.

TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has said the government will be intervening to ensure the Dublin Zoo stays open. 
The attraction’s director warned today that there is a real risk that Dublin Zoo may close for good due to the impact of Covid-19 restrictions,
Dr Christoph Schwitzer said he expects the zoo’s emergency cash reserves to last until next spring, “and not beyond right now”. 
The likely continuation of restrictions on visitor numbers into next year may see the zoo close its doors as it cannot afford to stay open under current operating conditions. 
In the Dáil today, Sinn Féin Mary Lou McDonald said the closure of the zoo would be devastating the to employment, the local economy and tourism.
The Taoiseach said the government does not want Dublin Zoo to close its doors, and will do everything it can to ensure it does not close.
Micheál Martin said it has been some time since capital funding was given to Dublin Zoo, indicating that additional funding would be forthcoming to the attraction.
He said the government has to intervene here to ensure the zoo is here for “generations to come and I intend to act on that”.
Schwitzer told Morning Ireland today that animal care alone costs €500,000 each month, with the zoo estimating losses of €8.2m in potential revenue so far this year.  
He said cost-saving measures have been taken but there are limitations to what they can do.
“You can’t furlough an elephant, you can’t switch off a zoo at night when you go home. Our animals need and deserve 24/7 care and we provide the highest standards of animal care and welfare possible,” he said.  
“Animal care alone costs us half a million a month, and these are very high fixed costs, and with no income from visitation, of course, we have difficulty meeting them.”
The zoo does not receive statutory funding from government but Schwitzer says he is currently engaged in “constructive” talks with local TDs who are all very supportive across parties but in the meantime, “I can’t stand idle as the director of Dublin Zoo, I have to do something”.
“We have relied on our emergency cash reserves to remain open when allowed, but even then, visitor number restrictions due to social distancing have made it near impossible to generate enough revenue to just break even. Without financial support, we are facing an uncertain future and may have to close,” Schwitzer said. 
“At this time of year, we are usually in the middle of Wild Lights and making preparations for the busy Christmas period, but instead we find ourselves fighting for our future and calling on the people of Ireland to answer our call and donate if possible.”
Minister of State for for Heritage and Electoral Reform Malcolm Noonan tweeted that he is hopeful that his department will be able to offer short term financial support to help tide over Dublin Zoo and Fota Island, stating that he raised the matter with the Taoiseach and the Public Expenditure Minister Michael McGrath.
“The outflow of public goodwill in terms of donations is testament to the high regard that these places have in our public consciousness. The loss of Dublin or Fota is unthinkable,” he said.
We want our zoos to bustle with the sound of families again, making lifetime memories for children and also playing that key role in conserving global biodiversity. I am hopeful we can assist in making that happen.
— Malcolm Noonan (@noonan_malcolm) November 18, 2020
Speaking to TheJournal.ie this morning, zookeeper Brendan Walsh said that while some staff in retail and administration were let go, the zoo “never compromised on the care of the animals”, despite the financial hardship over the last number of months.
“We can’t reduce the money we spend on the animals. There hasn’t been a single moment we’ve economised there and we can’t, our costs can’t change,” he said. “We’re lucky to be able to come to work and look after them but we need people’s help now.”

The zoo did manage to reopen for June, July and August but Walsh said this was at half capacity and there were costs associated with operating during a pandemic, such as PPE, additional administration, the implementation of one-way routes with signage and hand sanitiser. 
“The income was massively reduced compared to that time last year,” he said.
Walsh said the closure of the zoo is a real possibility if the financial situation does not dramatically change.
“It came through two world wars and numerous recessions and it’s always been difficult. The zoo is not what it was years ago, it’s very different, very modern and now we’re not just a visitor attraction we’re a conservation body.”
He said he thinks some of the animals are missing their human visitors.
“The orangutans and other primates, I think they enjoy the interactions with visitors. In lockdown they moved from their regular location on the island to get closer to the staff,” he said.
“The wolves have also been coming closer to the fence, which was a big surprise because wolves are generally very shy. When visitors came back in after the lockdown they were coming closer than anticipated.”
In a bid to counter the financial losses, Dublin Zoo launched the ‘Save Dublin Zoo’ fundraising campaign today, appealing to the Irish public for help.

Danny McCoy, chief executive of IBEC — the largest business lobbying group in the State — also called for “a sequential easing of restrictions to begin from the last week of November” for retailers and hospitality businesses, instead of 2 December as planned.
“While IBEC fully acknowledges the continuing need for vigilance, the manner of communications in the media from members of NPHET continues to be a source of uncertainty and irritation for businesses and the public in making necessary plans for the coming crucial period of Christmas.
“This pattern, now seemingly embedded, in limiting the choice for Government is one we understood you and colleagues were going to address,” he told the Taoiseach.
McCoy’s remarks are contained in a letter sent to Taoiseach Micheál Martin and senior government ministers yesterday.
It comes ahead of a Cabinet decision, due by the end of next week, on how the country is to move out of Level 5.
Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland Programme this morning, McCoy said, “We haven’t lost confidence in the government nor in NPHET, because they’re doing their best, they’re using the information as best they can. But the communication is awful.”
He accused members of NPHET of “kite-flying” through the media, which he said “does limit the government’s choices but it also gives frustration to the general public”.
But he said that Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan has a role to play as an adviser to the government.
‘Urgent concerns’
McCoy said that business owners have “very serious and urgent concerns” about the current restrictions.
“The current measures impact upon a large swathe of businesses through restrictions on retail deemed to be non-essential, food and drink services, hospitality, international travel and office-based environments,” he said.
“The blanket suppression of these sectors continues to lack any refinement despite learnings and evidence accumulated since last March.”
This approach “lacks empathy,” McCoy claimed, “and is at this point in the crisis creating much greater economic and social damage than is necessary”.

Level 5 public health restrictions are due to expire on 2 December but McCoy called on ministers to prioritise an early reopening of the retail, hospitality and travel sectors from the last week of November.
“Opening businesses in a controlled manner would be a far safer option than keeping everything closed and seeing restrictions ignored by the general public.
“The six weeks of Level 5 restrictions, in addition to prior weeks of restrictions in many counties, has had the desired effect of bringing about a substantial decline in the targeted metrics. Greater enforcement is required to drive the metrics down further,” McCoy said.
He called for “prior and meaningful engagement” with affected businesses to be included in government decision-making and communications.
Requesting an urgent meeting between ministers and IBEC, McCoy said that “confidence in the Plan for Living with Covid-19 and the guidance within the level restrictions is diminishing within the business community”.","IBEC has called for an early exit from Level 5 for retailers.",8,0,0,17128,"Nov 18th 2020, 11:22 AM"

Instead of sitting a fighter’s archnemesis ringside to run the rule over their performance ahead of a prospective future showdown, Sky have concocted the concept of Goggleboxers, wherein the televised broadcast frequently cuts away to an interested party studying the action from their couch.
They applied a poetic twist to that particular quirk during Saturday’s novel female world-title tripleheader, however. During natural lulls between rounds, viewers were treated to the sight of professional boxing’s most important Couch of all — retired former world champion Jane Couch — who sat on hers, watching the fruits of her life’s labour unfold on primetime television.
It was fitting that on a night during which one of female boxing’s most adored pioneers, Katie Taylor, topped a Sky-broadcast bill for the first time on a Saturday night, she shared some screentime with the woman who technically made it possible. Equally fitting was the fact that Taylor and her supporting cast of Terri Harper and Rachel Ball put their fists through the glass ceiling at Wembley Arena, of all places.
Couch celebrates her second-round victory over Simona Lukic in 1998.

In 1997, Couch was forced to turn down a £10,000 opportunity to fight at the same indoor venue when the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) refused her a professional boxing licence on account of her being a woman. She was, at the time, a world champion with a 5-0 record. A year later, she took the British board to court. The board’s solicitor, Bernard Buckley, argued during the landmark discrimination case that “many women suffer from premenstrual tension which makes them more emotional and more labile and accident-prone. They are too fragile to box and they bruise easily.”
Couch won the case, as a result of which the BBBofC were mandated to grant licences to qualifying female applicants and, by extension, allow them to compete for the first time in sanctioned professional bouts on UK soil. Couch received £15,000 in compensation, but the court victory did her little good aside from afford her the relative luxury of fighting in her home country: she continued to be ridiculed by the tabloids and within male-dominated boxing circles.
In a moving interview with Donald McRae in The Guardian last year, she repeatedly described herself as “damaged” — not by her 39 experiences in the ring but by the incalculably cruel treatment she received outside of it.
These days, she contends that the public simply wasn’t “ready” to embrace her and her pugilistic peers in the ’90s. She’s right. It’s only starting to get ready now, 20-something years on.
***
In September 2016, a month after reigning champion Katie Taylor’s dramatic quarter-final elimination from the Rio Olympics, she traversed the Atlantic to work with Ross Enamait in his Vernon, Connecticut gym. Enamait didn’t really knew who she was, but Taylor had read his personal coaching books throughout her amateur career. She felt that, in the absence of her then-estranged father-trainer Pete Taylor, the American’s training methodology would help to revitalise her ailing career ahead of the European Elite amateur championships due to take place two months later.

Within three weeks of her arrival, Taylor and Enamait had devised a plan for her to leave behind the amateur sport that she had elevated beyond comprehension and pursue a new dream, a second legacy, in boxing’s punch-for-pay ranks.
Taylor sent a private message to one of her Twitter followers, professional boxing promoter Eddie Hearn:
“Hi Eddie, I hope you’re well.
“I hope you don’t mind me reaching out like this out of the blue.
“I’ve been seriously considering turning pro the last few months, I think I could do for women’s pro boxing what I did for the amateur sport: bring it into focus and generate a serious interest.
“I already have a global profile and a great fan base. Of course, the pro game is impossible without a great promoter so I’m wondering if you would be interested in talking more about this?
“Much appreciated, Katie.”
Taylor might as well have sent the message in Irish such was Hearn’s lack of understanding of women’s boxing. He couldn’t countenance the notion of promoting a female boxer, not due to some deep-seeded misogyny but more so due to hands-up ignorance: he believed he wouldn’t know how to. But such was the magnitude of her achievements in the amateur sport, he felt as though he at least owed Taylor the courtesy of a meeting.
By the end of that meeting in Hearn’s office in Brentwood, Essex, he offered Taylor a six-fight deal worth £60,000. Brian Peters, in the room acting as Taylor’s manager, politely rebuffed it. And so, instead, they agreed to work together one fight at a time. Handshake; no contracts.

For Taylor’s eighth professional fight under Hearn’s Matchroom banner, a world-title defence against Jessica McCaskill in December 2017 which headlined a rare midweek show live on Sky Sports, she earned twice as much than she would have for her first six had she agreed to the originally proposed deal. In her sixteenth professional fight, an undisputed-title rematch with Delfine Persoon in August of this year, her share of the Sky Sports Box Office pay-per-view revenue generated in Ireland brought her total purse to somewhere in the region of €1.5m — roughly three times what the UFC’s leading female fighter Amanda Nunes received for her own most recent title fight two months beforehand. If Taylor disclosed her fight purses and external endorsements, she would likely be listed as one of the 10 highest-earning female athletes on the planet, and perhaps the best-paid woman outside of tennis.
All of which encapsulates — albeit crudely — how successful a venture it’s been not only for Taylor but for Hearn: you can’t truly quantify a sport’s cultural rise, but you can take Taylor’s income trajectory as being both commensurate to her own ascent within the boxing zeitgeist, and representative of a more ready acceptance of women’s professional boxing by those who pay to watch the sport.
And yes, there now exists a contract between her and her promoter.

This four-year first leg of Taylor and Hearn’s working relationship culminated in Saturday night’s unprecedented female world-title tripleheader at Wembley Arena. The mere idea of it would have been inconceivable to both when she debuted as a professional at the same venue in 2016.
The fear back then was that Taylor was opening herself up to a maelstrom of sexist rhetoric and ridicule — or worse still from Hearn’s perspective, that nobody would care.
As it transpired in reality, Taylor was already familiar with social media, so making people care was the problem, a four-year war, albeit one into which she entered as a veteran of a lengthier previous tour.
Many casual consumers of professional boxing still don’t care about the women’s sport. A portion of them appear to consider themselves humanity’s chief protagonists; they believe that if they don’t care, that must mean “nobody cares”. They’re easy to locate but harder to identify: cross-search the terms ‘nobody cares’ and ‘women’s boxing’ or something similar on Twitter and they’re the men you’ll find typically hiding behind fake names and cartoon profile pictures — so, actual nobodies — who wear their not caring as a sort of badge of honour in the crusade against ‘virtue-signalling’ and, of course, the new-age sociological phenomenon that frightens them most: women.
It must have come as a cruel blow for those same gatekeepers of Single Bed Twitter to discover last night that the Taylor-Gutierrez bill had been viewed well over two million times across all of Sky Sports’ platforms, with 600,000 of those tuning in on television in Ireland and Britain. Even a quick check of the available numbers during the live broadcast on Saturday showed that, while Taylor did her thing in the ring from around 10:50pm onwards, the number of concurrent viewers on the Sky’s YouTube and Facebook streams scarcely dropped below 200,000.

And make no mistake about it: all week, Sky uncompromisingly advertised Taylor-Gutierrez and its support bouts as a female sporting event; the free live streams were an extension of a public commitment to women’s sport made by the broadcasting giant back in March, and they were contextualised as such.
Indeed, Hearn had originally planned to stage an all-female card on the night only to have the notion shot down by his headline act: Taylor felt it might seem patronising.
Undercard bouts involving male Matchroom prospects were subsequently added to the bill per the boss’s orders but they were peripheral to the promotion; it was all about Taylor, Terri Harper, Rachel Ball and their respective world-title bouts.
People were under no illusions as to what they were tuning in for, and tune in they did in their droves.
Their time investment was hardly wasted, either, for Saturday night’s main course of female fights (and, to be fair, their male starters) gave enough of a taste of why people fall for boxing in the first place.
Rachel Ball, the 29-year-old social worker whose colleagues discovered only on the day of her first fight on Sky back in August — her seventh overall — that she moonlights as a professional boxer, fulfilled her dream of becoming a world champion.
Terri Harper, the 24-year-old former British underage amateur standout who only a year ago left her job in a chip shop and, through her subsequent earnings in pro boxing, has his since bought her first home with her partner, continued to live her own wildest dream: she persevered through the pain of a broken right hand suffered early doors and stopped opponent Katharina Thanderz in the ninth to defend her world title.
And Katie Taylor, the 34-year-old Irish legen– well, you know the scéal there. But anyone previously unacquainted who didn’t enjoy watching Taylor conjure a storm of eight-ounce hail need delve no further into the sport of boxing, because it’s plainly not for them. (We’ll return to Taylor’s opponent, Gutierrez, in a moment).

More profound than the fights themselves, though, was the unabashedly female feel to the show as a whole. To their credit, purely as it pertained to production, Sky’s women’s tripleheader felt more like a Box Office pay-per-view than a typical Off-Broadway Saturday-night broadcast but it rarely strayed into over-the-top territory. It struck more as a celebration of female professional boxing for what it is currently: an utterly imperfect but perpetually improving sport which, until just four years ago, existed only in basements Off-Off-Off-Broadway, clinging to life only because women like Jane Couch refused to let it die. And a sport which, while it continues to build itself from the ring outwards, boasts its own unique qualities and quirks on the safe side of the ropes, all of which are worth celebrating too.
For example, between rounds during one of the men’s bouts earlier in the card, Sky cut to footage of Rachel Ball braiding fellow world-title challenger Katharina Thanderz’s hair into cornrows. (The majority of female fighters consider it best practice: a bun can come undone, a ponytail can fail; long hair can be a nightmare).
It was a weird and wonderful moment — weird simply because it’s something rarely seen on a televised boxing broadcast; wonderful because of the odd Venn diagram in which stand-in hairdresser Ball had become the intersection: she had suffered her only career loss — a narrow one — to Thanderz 18 months prior, and yet there she was preparing the Norwegian for a bout against the woman with whom she had shared breakfast only hours beforehand, her fellow Englishwoman Terri Harper.
Because it has always had to swim upstream to stay afloat, there is a sort of touching kinship interwoven into women’s professional boxing at world-championship level which distinguishes it from the more brashly individualistic upper echelons of the men’s game.
And for similarly stark reasons, what the women also do better than the men is actually fight each other.

The male professional sport is currently a soup of alphabet titles to the extent that no part-time observer could be expected to know who the ‘real champions’ are, or to even care anymore. Monetary disputes, dirty laundry and, perhaps most pertinently, pride preclude the picture from being cleared up.
The sport’s preeminent promoters prefer to have pissing contests via YouTube interviews than to work together. The sport’s preeminent champions so often conjure reasons to avoid squaring off with each other that most superfights play out through the medium of online fan debate. The sport’s preeminent figures have, unfortunately, become a bit too emotional, a bit too labile, bitching and moaning about each other instead of settling their differences in the ring, like…women.
Because conversely, those same champions’ female equivalents are far more likely to take career risks. Women haven’t banked enough reward to be able to afford the luxury of protecting their unbeaten records, for one thing. But they’re also trying to build something, for each other as well as for the future generations they inspire.
Hearn is consequently confident that he can manufacture a scenario over the next two years in which there will be a single undisputed champion in at least the women’s lightweight, light-welterweight and welterweight classes; and that even then, those three unequivocal divisional rulers would face each other in era-defining bouts to create some sort of champion squared, or cubed — effectively an antidote to the rampant bollocksology that sickens people away from the men’s sport.
The potential commercial success of that pre-’90s model goes a long way to explaining Hearn’s recently relentless recruitment of world-class female boxers; he’s fully aware that the pieces will fall into place even more seamlessly if he is in sole possession of the puzzle.
He already has the market cornered because he was the only one of his promotional peer group to identify the market. He identified through Katie Taylor, who personifies it better than anybody else, that there is a general trend within modern professional boxing: men talk and women ‘do’.

As for the talk about Taylor’s opponent, Miriam Gutierrez, after she received a 10-round battering on Saturday: that the Spaniard was depicted by a portion of talking heads and thumbs to be some sort of rank novice who ‘didn’t belong in the ring with Taylor’ was a total distortion of reality. Gutierrez has boxed competitively for 21 years. Before turning professional in 2017, a year after Taylor, she won four Spanish national titles in two weight categories as an amateur. She knows her way around a ring.
In her status as WBA mandatory challenger, she was indeed merely an opponent for Taylor to simply get out of the way to clear her diary for 2021. Before the fight, middleweight world champion Savannah Marshall revealed that she had previously sparred with Guttierrez who operates 25 pounds and four divisions below her, and that she was expecting a good scrap on account of the fact that Gutierrez can seriously punch. Marshall, the only woman ever to beat Claressa Shields, knows a thing or two about ‘good’ and what it looks like in boxing terms. And Gutierrez is good — she just met ‘great’ and took a pummeling. It happens every single weekend if you turn on the sports channels on your TV.
In terms of difficulty relative to her own ability, Taylor’s run of four preceding fights — versus Rose Volante, Delfine Persoon, Christina Linardatou (at 140lbs) and Persoon again — was biblical, surpassing anything done by a male fighter in the same time period. In a conversation about ‘depth’ or ‘competition’, those fights might be worth a passing mention, particularly considering Taylor arguably lost one of them — a point stressed at the time by some of the same people who perpetuate the notion that it’s all too easy for her now.
Just another easy night's work.

None of which is to say that female boxing has ‘caught up’, or anything of the sort. While the competition even for fighters of Taylor’s ilk is worthy of more respect at its top end, the middle tiers of most divisions unequivocally lack depth.
But post-Olympics infusions of elite-level amateur talent and more nights like last Saturday — and bigger and better nights still — will eventually see to that. There are signs of genuine growth to be found in the last four days, not to mind the last four years.
Throughout both of those periods of time, it has been frequently said with the best of intentions that, ‘It’s not women’s boxing — it’s just boxing.’ But there may no longer be a need for such qualifiers. Women’s professional boxing is a work in progress, sure, but it has plenty going for it. Plenty to be excited about.
And if you’re not excited, it’s worth remembering that you can avail of the option to simply not watch it. It’s also worth bearing in mind that nobody cares.

The research, by the University of Bath and the Natural History Museum, contradicts previous theories and concludes that dinosaurs might have continued to dominate the planet if the impact had not occurred.
Scientists collected a set of different dinosaur family trees and used statistical modelling to assess if each of the main dinosaur groups was able to produce new species at the time.
Their study, published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, found that dinosaurs were not in decline before the asteroid hit – contradicting some previous research.
It also discovered that some dinosaur groups, such as hadrosaurs and ceratopsians, were “thriving” and would not have died out then.
Lead author Joe Bonsor is undertaking his PhD jointly at the Milner Centre for Evolution at the University of Bath and the Natural History Museum.
“Previous studies done by others have used various methods to draw the conclusion that dinosaurs would have died out anyway, as they were in decline towards the end of the Cretaceous period,” he said.
However, we show that if you expand the dataset to include more recent dinosaur family trees and a broader set of dinosaur types, the results don’t actually all point to this conclusion – in fact only about half of them do.
Dinosaurs were widespread globally at the time of the asteroid impact, at the end of the Late Cretaceous period, and were the dominant form of animal of most land ecosystems.
It is still contentious among paleobiologists as to whether dinosaurs were declining at the time of their extinction.
The researchers of the latest study say it is difficult to assess the diversity of dinosaurs due to gaps in the fossil record.

This can be due to factors such as which bones are preserved as fossils, how accessible the fossils are in the rock to allow them to be found, and the locations where palaeontologists search for them.
In the study, the team used statistical methods to overcome these sampling biases, examining the rates of speciation of dinosaur families rather than counting the number of species belonging to the family.
“The main point of our paper is that it isn’t as simple as looking at a few trees and making a decision – the large unavoidable biases in the fossil record and lack of data can often show a decline in species, but this may not be a reflection of the reality at the time,” Bonsor said.
“Our data don’t currently show they were in decline, in fact some groups such as hadrosaurs and ceratopsians were thriving and there’s no evidence to suggest they would have died out 66 million years ago had the extinction event not happened.”

558,193,"South Australia announces six-day 'circuit-breaker' lockdown after sudden outbreak",https://www.thejournal.ie/south-australia-circuit-breaker-5270479-Nov2020/,"SOUTH AUSTRALIA HAS announced a six-day “circuit-breaker” lockdown for its nearly two million people to contain a sudden coronavirus outbreak that ended a months-long streak of no infections.
Schools, shops, pubs, factories and even takeaway restaurants were told to close at midnight and stay-at-home orders were issued for residents across the state.
A total of 22 cases have now been linked to a cluster that emerged from an Adelaide hotel used to quarantine travellers from overseas.
“We are going hard and we are going early,” state premier Steven Marshall said.
“Time is of the essence and we must act swiftly and decisively. We cannot wait to see how bad this becomes.”
The state is the first in Australia to issue a blanket ban on outdoor exercise, and mask-wearing will be required across the state, which had not recorded a significant outbreak since April.
The measures stand in stark contrast to the United States – where some politicians are refusing to implement basic virus measures even as case numbers surge – or Europe, where lockdowns were introduced only after infections spiralled.
Chief health officer Nicola Spurrier said the infections appeared to be caused by a particularly virulent strain that was spreading “very, very rapidly”, with people becoming contagious within 24 hours.
“I cannot be making this decision in two or three weeks’ time or even two or three days’ time because it is going to be too late,” she said.
Since the cluster was confirmed officials had begun ordering thousands of suspected close contacts to self-isolate, and suspended international flights.

Adelaide residents have since been flocking to Covid-19 testing sites, with many forced to wait several hours in long queues to be seen by overwhelmed clinicians.
Spurrier said the state hoped to avoid a lengthy Melbourne-style lockdown. Residents in Australia’s second-largest city spent months mostly confined to their homes after security bungles at a hotel quarantine.
The surprise announcement sparked a fresh round of panic-buying in Adelaide, prompting supermarkets to introduce two-item limits for certain goods and to issue assurances they would remain open.
“We will have police officers on standby to attend if we see any civil disorder and we would take action,” South Australia police commissioner Grant Stevens said.
Melbourne, which recorded thousands of cases and hundreds of deaths at the height of its outbreak, has begun easing restrictions after more than two weeks without any new cases.
Other Australian regions, where the virus has largely been stamped out, have imposed new quarantine rules on anyone travelling from South Australia.

The country’s internal borders had been gradually reopening and were due to be almost fully reopened by Christmas, but the latest outbreak may put that at risk.
It will also further slow the return of more than 30,000 Australians who remain stranded overseas due to government-imposed caps on international travellers – despite a government pledge to bring them home by the holidays.
Australia has been relatively successful in containing the virus, with just over 27,700 cases and 907 deaths recorded since the pandemic began.

Trump fired Christopher Krebs in a tweet, saying his recent statement defending the security of the election was “highly inaccurate”.
The firing of Krebs, a Trump appointee and director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, comes as Trump is refusing to recognise the victory of Joe Biden, and is removing high-level officials seen as insufficiently loyal.
He fired defence secretary Mark Esper on 9 November, part of a broader shake-up that put Trump loyalists in senior Pentagon positions.
Krebs, a former Microsoft executive, ran the agency, known as CISA, from its creation in the wake of Russian interference with the 2016 vote through to this month’s election.
He won bipartisan praise as CISA co-ordinated federal state and local efforts to defend electoral systems from foreign or domestic interference.
In recent days, Krebs has repeatedly pushed back against false claims that the election was tainted.
Earlier yesterday, he tweeted report citing 59 election security experts saying there is no credible evidence of computer fraud in the 2020 election outcome.

Age: 57
Location: Cork
Who you live with: My husband, my eldest son (24) and two crazy dogs
I have been mainly working from home since June. I feel the rhythm of it suits me, but I do miss spending time with others at work, giving training courses and popping out for tea or lunch. My husband still goes out to work as he is in essential services. Our oldest son is living here at the minute and working from home too. I have set up a little home office which I share with my large rubber plant.
I have a good sense of the things I need to do for my health, both mind and body. Unfortunately, knowing and doing are not the same! I do try to take care of my health, but sometimes I let myself off the hook or put things off, so I am trying to work on that.
Daily activity levels: I try to get out for a walk most days before work. Lately, I have been doing a short online yoga session a few days a week too. I do need to build in more physical activity generally.
Daily stress levels: At this stage in my life, things are fairly okay. Walking, taking time on my own, perhaps just to read or write helps manage most stresses. My work normally involves people, so I need time by myself too. Otherwise, as my husband is aware, I get cranky!
Eating/drinking habits: Meals are fairly healthy, lots of fruit and veg and not very much processed or fried food. I like a glass of wine, though I try to limit it. I also have a long term relationship with chocolate. In recent years my weight has crept up. This was never an issue until I hit my 50s, so I do need to be more aware of what I eat and when. 
Self care: I was involved in a fairly intensive project at work for several months and it was quite demanding. My self-care slipped during this time, so this is something I need to get back on track. I’m trying to build some mindful meditation into my days.
Tuesday
Morning: My sunrise alarm clock (my best purchase) wakes me today at around 7.10am by gradually filling the room with light. My husband is already up and around. I’m not a leap out of bed kind of person so I take a few minutes to think about the day before getting up. I have some water and get ready for a walk before work. Unfortunately, our dogs are a bit manic on the leads so I don’t take them on my own when I walk, but they always look hopeful! I try to use this time as a mindful practice. Back at home, after showering and dressing, I have my usual winter breakfast of warm berries, yoghurt and muesli. I eat this while looking out at the rain, which I love to do. Work starts for 9am.
Afternoon: I am putting together a training programme that I will facilitate live online on Thursday, I’m a little anxious as I want to do it well, but I do love this kind of work. I have a few glasses of water as I work and stop for lunch at 1.15pm. I share an omelette with bacon and veg with my son, and we have a chat.
A surveyor comes to look at our roof which is leaking over the dining room. I tell him proudly that the water was ‘pouring’ in through one of the leaks the day before, I’m not sure if he is impressed.
Evening: I’m still tweaking the training course at 5.30pm, so my son kindly offers to cook. I have a quick hello with my husband and fill him in on the surveyor’s visit, we will need to get work done on it or will be in for a soggy winter. At 7.30pm I stop for dinner, chicken fajitas with peppers and kidney beans, lovely! I have a mock mimosa with it – tonic water with a splash of orange juice in a Prosecco glass. It feels like a treat!
Lately, the three of us do cryptic crosswords together, so this happens tonight as the dishes are being done (dishwasher gave up the ghost during the first lockdown). My husband and I then watch two episodes of a series we like and I have a cup of tea and a chocolate biscuit.
Bedtime: Though we had planned to go to bed earlier, it is after 12am by the time we head up. I read for a little while as it helps me get to sleep.
Wednesday
Morning: I wake up at about 7.15am, my husband is already up and dressed and leaves early for work. I snuggle in bed for another 20 minutes listening to the rain. I put out my yoga mat (a Christmas present from my lovely daughter) and find a simple session on my phone to do, as I’m still fairly new to it. After breakfast, a quick shower, then I dress with a bit of care for work and put on a little make up. I have three different video calls today so I want to look a little presentable! I ‘go’ to work armed with two big glasses of water, one for me and one for my rubber plant for his weekly watering, it’s about 8.50am.
Afternoon: The day is busy with calls, but it is great to see my work colleagues, even on screen. Since lockdown I have missed the connection as we are a friendly bunch. I drink my water and between meetings I grab a cup of tea and have a chat with my son while he is on his break. I take a late lunch break at 2.30pm to send my sister and her husband an anniversary card. I buy a gift card from the kind lady in the post office who warns me that sending the gift card in the post is like sending cash, I can’t see another way of getting it to the other end of the country, so off it goes with hopeful wishes for safe delivery! I have a quick lunch at my desk, not a good habit.
Evening: I make homemade burgers (no bun for me), salad and wedges for dinner, we eat about 7.30pm. We all agree that we would like to eat earlier, but somehow are not managing that. I phone my mother for a chat, she lives quite far away and I haven’t seen her for about four months. She doesn’t linger too long as her soaps are on and nothing and nobody gets in the way of them
I do some laundry then join my husband and son to wrestle the cryptic crossword. My contribution is one clue! My husband bakes a loaf of oat and yoghurt bread, it smells lovely. I take a magnesium supplement, listen to a podcast on mindfulness and gratitude, lovely practices to live by, and I decide to paint my toenails, mindfully!
Bedtime: Somehow or other it is 12am by the time we go to bed, we both read for a little while. At night I try to read about topics like positive wellbeing, as I find it more relaxing than fiction (though I read a lot of that at other times, our house is always full of books).
Thursday
Morning: I wake at 7.15am. I feel tired though I have been sleeping so much better lately, for a while I wasn’t. I think getting outdoors more helps, and maybe the magnesium too. I wrap up and go out for a morning walk. I have some water before I go and as my hat has been on the radiator it feels lovely and cosy. The little things! The sun is shining as I get back.
I have some of my husband’s baked bread with marmalade and a cup of tea in my favourite mug. I have time to have a leisurely shower and wash my hair, then get dressed and start work at 9am.
Afternoon: I decide to use my lunch break to make vegetable soup. The beauty of working from home is I can leave it simmering and pop down to turn it off later.
The online course I was meant to be delivering today has just been rescheduled for a few weeks’ time. As I have the preparation already done, I really try to appreciate what it feels like to be ready so far in advance – very unusual for me! I hope this will motivate me the next time I have something similar to do.
Our new dishwasher arrives and is installed by two masked men, which sounds sinister, but these are the times we are living in. I work until 5pm and then have a bowl of my soup.
Evening: My husband makes dinner. I can never remember the name of the dish, and he tells me (again) that it is ‘fejoida’, a Brazilian recipe shared by our daughter during the first lockdown. It’s a black bean, veggie sausage and sweet potato stew and we all have a bowl at about 8pm, I have a glass of white wine and my husband does too. We all happily load the dishwasher, a welcome addition to the household.
I have a WhatsApp video call with my sister after dinner. She is in great form because she has now lost over 23lbs and is walking every evening, I’m full of admiration. I watch an episode of The Queen’s Gambit with my son, which we’re loving, and then watch another episode of Line Of Duty with my husband.
Bedtime: We head to bed at 11.45 pm, but as I’m opening the window I notice we’ve left a light on downstairs. My considerate husband goes down and switches it off. When we are both in bed we can hear a loud drip-drip-drip as the rain lands on the plastic bin outside. We both know this will stop us from sleeping (well, mainly me) so my kind husband dresses again and goes out to sort it out. It’s now after 12am… again!
Friday
Morning: It’s nearly 8am by the time I get up. I have a shower and get dressed, more video calls today so I try to look presentable. I have a quick read of the news on TheJournal.ie, a habit formed during the first lockdown to keep up with all the Covid details. I have some muesli with milk and chopped apple, and a glass of fizzy multi-vitamin. I mean to have vitamins every morning but I often forget.
Afternoon: I spend some time sending thank you emails to work colleagues who have been so supportive during and after the big project I had been involved in. At lunchtime I go for a walk in my favourite park with a friend, we have a lovely catch up and a takeaway tea and scone (his treat). When I get home, I have some vegetable soup, which is even nicer today, and a glass of water. I’m feeling nicely energised and work again until 4pm, when I have a cup of tea, a biscuit and a quick chat with my son – we’re still intrigued by the US election – and go back to work.
Evening: I have counselling clients today on Zoom so I work until 7pm. I then start cooking dinner, Quorn shepherd’s pie with green beans. I get a call from my husband to say that his car battery is flat. Thankfully, my son gets the jump leads for me as they are in the shed which also houses many creepy crawlies. I head out and watch supportively from the warmth of my car as my husband gets his car started! We have dinner with a glass of wine each at about 8pm. When my son comes in we have a game of Scrabble as a break from screens – a family ritual we developed during the first lockdown. This time the cryptic crossword is also done at the same time between turns, good brain-training for sure!
Bedtime: Bed for 11.45pm, this time no lights and no drips.

Saturday
Morning: I lie-in until 9.15am, and feel rested. I do about 20 minutes of yoga and feel looser and straighter after it. I go for a longer walk today of about an hour. I love just looking at houses: how they are painted, their names, the little details. There are lots of lovely houses around our area and it’s a nice mindful walk. When I get back I have a long relaxing shower. I make some scrambled egg on toast and a cup of tea and tackle some housework.
Afternoon: My husband and I do the main weekly shop together, now a social outing! We are obviously losing the run of ourselves with kitchen appliances, as we decide to replace our under-the-counter fridge with a bigger one. Plans are made to go looking later. I can feel a slight rising panic as suggestions are made to pull out cupboards, radiators or bits of kitchen counter to accommodate the new fridge.
After a lunch of soup and toast we go fridge shopping. I am disappointed to see that all the fridges are white or grey, I’m thinking orange or turquoise as I love colour, but no luck. No purchase is made.
Evening: We have leftover shepherd’s pie and I have a mock mimosa, followed by tea and some dark chocolate. I eat less chocolate when it is dark. Milk chocolate just seems to disappear of its own accord. My husband has some work stuff to do, I read for an hour and try to ring my mother but her number is engaged (or she doesn’t want to be disturbed from her soaps), so I go back to my book.
Bedtime: I go to bed at about 12am and read a little more, I love weekends.
Sunday
Morning: I wake about 9am feeling rested and the sun is shining. I have some water and go to our local park for my walk. It’s lovely to see lots of people just strolling in the sunshine and little kids on the swings! When I get home I have a shower. Sunday morning is my time for beautifying, so lots of exfoliating and whatnot. All three of us have a late breakfast together, I have eggs with toast and some warm apple and pear with cinnamon.
Afternoon: I do an (almost) Everest sized pile of ironing while listening to a podcast. Later I make some salad with lots of fruit and coloured veg and falafel. My husband is finished in the garden so we eat together. 
We go out shopping again for a fridge and find one or two that might suit, but they aren’t orange or turquoise! As we stand in the shop we realise that we still have no idea yet where to put one, we both decide that enough is enough for one weekend.
Evening: My daughter and I message each other over WhatsApp, and we have a nice little virtual chat. I cook chicken tikka masala with my son, it fills the kitchen with lovely smells. I think a glass of wine would be nice but I remember we decided not to buy any this week! Our younger son phones as we are cooking and we all catch up with his news from college. We find a film to watch later, which is action packed but confusing.
Bedtime: I get to bed at about 12.45pm, my stomach is gurgling as it always does after curry, so it takes a while to get to sleep
Monday
Morning: I wake at about 7.45am as my husband is off for a few days so we don’t need to wake as early as usual. I get dressed and go out for a quick walk. There’s a light rain but it’s nice. I come back and have some strawberries, muesli and yoghurt and I remember to take my multi-vitamin. I shower and start work at 9am.
Afternoon: I am feeling very tired today, not enough sleep! I realise I haven’t drank any water during the morning, which hasn’t helped. I decide to break for an early lunch. I have a chat with my husband and eat some scrambled eggs and spinach. I’m even more tired after a meeting as it involved a lot of reading of documents on screen and concentrating closely. I have a few stretches to loosen out. I work until 5.30pm.
Evening: My husband and I prepare a beef casserole, I feel like some comfort food and this will do the trick. I do some of my own social media work until dinner is ready at 7.30pm then we have the casserole, and yes, it is lovely comfort food! I have my mock mimosa and we have a nice catch up. The last week has been busy and we haven’t really had time to chat properly. I go back upstairs to finish a piece of work that needs to be done. I work until after 11pm. This can happen when I get into a flow and want to finish something.
Bedtime: I feel really tired and my shoulders are aching from sitting for most of the day, I head to bed at about 11.45pm, it’s been a long day.
What I’ve learned…
Working from home means I do need to make an effort to move about more, I feel so much better if I get outside walking in the morning or do some yoga. It energises me for the day and I just feel generally better.

Stephen Kenny at Irish training yesterday.

Here’s a flavour of the chaos.
Ukraine’s game with Switzerland in Lucerne was cancelled hours before kick-off with the Ukraine squad quarantined with six Covid cases; Norway were banned by their government from travelling to a game in Romania, and so saw the game cancelled and had to pull together a completely different squad for tonight’s game with Austria; England had to get government approval to allow Iceland come to Wembley from Denmark, a nation currently culling their mink population to stop a mutation of Covid-19; while Cristiano Ronaldo tested positive and was forced to enter the best-paid quarantine period on the planet. 
Ireland, meanwhile, have been luckless if not the worst affected, with five positive cases and six close contacts among the squad across two windows.
Stephen Kenny’s run of misfortune does not end at the virus, either. Across his seven games to date he has lost a total of 14 players to injury, while a midfielder and a goalkeeper coach have withdrawn from this camp for different personal reasons and David McGoldrick has retired. 
Consistency of selection has therefore been a distant dream. The fewest number of team changes Kenny has made from game-to-game has been three; he’s twice had to make six. 
Tonight Ireland play Bulgaria in Dublin, and are without exactly half of the 26-man squad originally named for the game. Further to that, Kenny is without five starters from Sunday’s defeat to Wales as Matt Doherty and James McClean have Covid-19, Jayson Molumby and Jeff Hendrick are suspended and Adam Idah is injured. 
Not that Ireland’s plight is unique: Bulgaria will be missing nine players. 
“I don’t think anyone has”, said Stephen Kenny yesterday when asked if he had ever faced a challenge like this. 
Unprecedented streaks have become the theme of Kenny’s start in the job, and the side are currently on their worst goalscoring run in history having not scored in six games.
The only goal thus far came against Bulgaria in the group’s opening game, a Shane Duffy header from a corner. It’s exactly a year to the day since Ireland last scored a goal from open play. 
Ending that wretched run and avoiding relegation are the main targets tonight in a game that has become freighted with all the wrong kinds of meaning. 
Avoiding defeat tonight will dodge the relegation Ireland were supposed to be met with after last Nations League Campaign, but a re-jig of the competition structure by Uefa offered them a reprieve. They are unlikely to get so lucky again this time around, with the only silver lining to relegation the fact it would give Ireland an easier backdoor route to qualification for Euro 2024. But that’s not exactly the long-term vision Kenny’s appointment was supposed to bring. 
“I have to be honest, I would be”, said Kenny when asked if he would be disappointed with relegation. “So it’s important that doesn’t happen.”
Ireland might be able to give themselves a better chance of making the 2022 World Cup by climbing to second seeds in next month’s draw, but that will involve winning – and thus scoring – tonight, along with results going their way elsewhere: namely that Russia lose to Serbia and Northern Ireland beat Romania. 
The squad are undoubtedly weary at their reality at the moment, with a round of negative Covid tests yesterday morning met with a relief tinged with surprise.
On Sunday, Jack Byrne became the first domestic player to play competitively for Ireland since 1985, and he has since been joined in the squad by his Shamrock Rovers team-mates Graham Burke and Aaron McEneff. Burke is actually the joint most prolific international striker left in the squad – he has scored once, in a 2018 friendly with the United States – while McEneff has transferred from Northern Ireland.

Dundalk’s Michael Duffy is trying to do the same but his paperwork still hasn’t cleared Fifa, and Kenny phoned him on Monday to explain he would otherwise have been included. Jack Taylor and Troy Parrott have been called up from the U21 squad, though the latter won’t start tonight after a lengthy injury lay-off. 
Initially, these Nations League games were seen as a chance for Kenny to inculcate his system and ideas ahead of the World Cup qualifiers, but those plans have been smithereened by injury and Covid-19. Instead, he has talked up the fact players have been blooded at senior level and so will give Ireland some depth next year, while hoping the established gang of Doherty, Stevens, Coleman, Egan, McCarthy, Robinson and Connolly will be fit and available from now.  
Elsewhere, the players and managers have talked of needing bit more luck in front of goal as they are creating chances, but that’s only true to a point. There were myriad spurned chances last month, but Ireland created little against Wales on Sunday and nothing against England. 
That needs to change tonight in a game Ireland perhaps need to win to avoid wintering with a wretched, winless early record under Kenny. But the extent to which we can pass judgement on the new manager’s early work is complicated by the absurd circumstances. 
“I don’t think you can make any realistic assessment”, said Kenny yesterday. “I think our performance against Slovakia showed what we want to do and how we want to play. That was very clear, and showed the potential that exists.” 
Regardless of tonight’s result, the circumstances mean that we have yet to see any kind of template for how Kenny’s Ireland might approach those World Cup qualifiers, and the extent of the transformation the new manager may be able to bring about. 
Everything has been undermined by this berserk reality, to the point where it’s questionable whether the games should have been played in the first place.

Kenny said the latest Covid cases can be traced back to a player bringing it into the Irish bubble from outside, which merely emphasises the negatory effect of allowing players move between bubbles. The manager was instead keen to stress the traumatic impact a positive case can have on a player when asked about Jose Mourinho’s concerns yesterday, and Conor Hourihane offered an honest and eloquent insight into a player’s mindset amid a pandemic. 
“Lads are worried for loved ones at home. ‘Am I taking this home to people?’ People are dying, it’s terrible.
“We’re all worried about results, performances and goals and whatever – and yes that’s what we all want – but, listen, I’ve had a family issue with Covid, somebody unfortunately passing away.
“Not taking it home is hugely important to myself, with what has happened in the last few months in my family. My partner is pregnant as well, so I don’t want to be taking anything back to her. There are a lot of factors. But once I don’t get it and don’t take it home, that’s all the matters at the end of the day. Once everyone is safe around me, that’s all that matter.” 
Once again unto the breach tonight, then, for the last act of a campaign that was supposed to be about finding out how Ireland would play under their new manager but has instead raised questions about whether they should have been asked to play at all.

562,215,"Teachers' union asks government to start school Christmas break a few days earlier",https://www.thejournal.ie/christmas-break-tui-5270225-Nov2020/,"THE TEACHERS’ UNION of Ireland (TUI) has said that “serious consideration” should be given to closing schools for the Christmas break on the afternoon of Friday 18 December rather than on Tuesday 22 December.
The TUI, representing 19,000 post-primary and further education teachers, said that the “once-off measure” would indicate to the Department of Education’s intention “to protect the wellbeing” of teachers, school staff and students.
The teachers union also said that this slightly extended break would allow for a longer lead-in time so that students and teachers can restrict movements before meeting elderly or vulnerable relatives at Christmas, if the public-health guidelines allow for it.
TUI general secretary Michael Gillespie said:
“Recent months have been unprecedentedly difficult and draining for school communities, with a million students returning to recalibrated classrooms that were barely recognisable as those they vacated the previous March.
Thanks to the remarkable work of staff, schools have remained open throughout all levels of restrictions, including Level 5. However, stress and anxiety levels remain extremely high as a result of a range of worries and concerns that were not imaginable this time last year.
A survey of 1,500 TUI members carried out last month showed that 23% of respondents said they have an underlying health issue that is of concern during the Covid-19 pandemic, while 31% share a household with somebody who has an underlying health issue, and 11% share a household with somebody over 70 years of age.
In a separate part of the survey, 95% said their work is somewhat or significantly more difficult compared to twelve months ago.

Gillespie said that staff and students are “far more fatigued” than they would be during a ‘normal’ school year, and an earlier break would give them “a significant and much needed boost”.
There is much well-intentioned theorising about the concept of wellbeing in schools, but this would be a real, tangible action that could benefit all in the school community.
It could also prove to be a ‘stitch in time’ measure that helps prevent longer absences due to burnout and exhaustion later in the school year.

The figure means more than 11% of all staff members at the hospital are currently off work. However the situation has been described as being “far more stable” than it was last week. 
The Kildare hospital last week cancelled all non-emergency surgery and outpatient activity for a period of two weeks due to the outbreaks.
A statement issued on behalf of Naas General Hospital yesterday said it is “continuing to respond to pressures arising from a number of Covid-19 outbreaks”. 
“The Hospital Covid Plan is being implemented and progress has made to stabilise the situation,” the statement said.
“As of 16 November there are currently 12 Covid-positive patients in the hospital.  Ongoing work will be required to provide for additional capacity supported by key resources.
As of 16 November there are currently 87 staff not available due to [being] Covid positive or [having] Covid contacts.
This is out of 774 whole-time equivalent (WTE) employees working in the hospital. WTE is a unit used to show a person’s workload in the context of different things. 
It is expected that some staff will return to work later this week after following HSE guidance.  
Joe Hoolan, the industrial relations officer in the Dublin Mid-Leinster Region for the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) told TheJournal.ie that he is in regular contact with the hospital about the outbreaks. 
“The situation is far more stable than it was a week and a half ago,” he said.  
On 6 November, the INMO issued a statement asking Naas Hospital to suspend all non-essential services.
“We were very concerned that the hospital was heading towards a cliff,” Hoolan said.  
He said cancelling these services would help stabilise the staff roster system. 
Hoolan added that the situation is “still not ideal”, but the roster is more stable this week.
As of Monday, he said union members working at the hospital “see there is a plan in place and there is regular communication from management to staff”.
“Everyone knows what they are doing and they feel supported,” he added, but staffing levels still aren’t “where they should be”.  
“By the end of the week, they will hopefully be out of this current crisis,” Hoolan said. 
We’re a little bit more reassured that management are in charge of it and that there is a plan for the staff.
Last Thursday, 77 staff members at Naas Hospital were unavailable for work.

HSE CEO Paul Reid said the situation in the hospital was “back to where we were in April in terms of the hospital just dealing with critical and urgent care”. 
Emergency Department
Naas General Hospital said there has been a “noticeable reduction” in attendance to the emergency department over the past week. 
“The message for the public is that please don’t delay to seek medical attention,” a hospital statement said.
A similar drop in emergency department attendance was recorded earlier in the pandemic during periods of strict lockdown.
At the start of April, the Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan urged people with symptoms not related to Covid-19 to not avoid hospitals for fear of contracting the illness. 
Patients of Naas Hospital have been contacted in recent days following the decision to stop elective surgeries and outpatient services.

The hearing, the second in less than a month, follows criticism of the social media companies for their handling of political content during the recent election.
The companies have been facing pressure to remove what many see as harmful misinformation around the elections, while also fighting claims of suppression of certain political views.
Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey testified remotely to the session, which was called to discuss “censorship and suppression of news articles” and the “handling of the 2020 election” by the platforms.
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, chairing the Judiciary Committee hearing, warned the CEOs that new regulations are needed to ensure the social media giants are held responsible for decisions on removing, filtering or allowing content to remain.
“It seems like you’re the ultimate editor,” Graham said at the opening as he took aim at decisions by both platforms to limit the distribution of a New York Post article claiming to expose wrongdoing involving President-elect Joe Biden’s son during the campaign.
“When you have companies that have the power of governments [and] have far more power than traditional media outlets, something has to give.”
‘Megaphone for falsehoods’
Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal also rebuked the companies for what he said was inadequate action on political misinformation by President Donald Trump.
“The president has used this megaphone to spread vicious falsehoods in an apparent attempt to overturn the will of voters,” Blumenthal said.
Blumenthal said the companies had “power far exceeding the robber barons of the last Gilded Age” and have “profited hugely by strip mining data about our private lives and promoting hate speech and voter suppression”.
Republican Senator Mike Lee meanwhile denounced what he called “instances in which your platforms are taking a very distinctively partisan approach and not a neutral one to election related content moderation… just days before the election”.
From the other side, Blumenthal said that “Facebook, seems to have a record of making accommodations and caving to conservative pressure” on content policies.
Democrat Dianne Feinstein questioned the adequacy of Twitter’s labeling of unverified tweets such as those of Trump claiming an election victory.
“Does that label do enough to prevent the tweets harms when the tweet is still visible and is not accurate?” the California senator asked.
Subhead
However, both Dorsey and Zuckerberg defended their efforts to curb harmful misinformation during the election campaign.
“We strengthened our enforcement against militias, conspiracy networks, and other groups to help prevent them from using our platform to organise violence or civil unrest in the period after the election,” Zuckerberg said.

He said Facebook removed false claims about polling conditions and displayed warnings on more than 150 million pieces of content flagged by independent fact-checkers.
The two CEOs also said they would study the spread of election misinformation while allowing independent academics to carry out similar research.
Dorsey also said that filtering at Twitter was not a result of bias, despite claims to the contrary by conservatives.
In filtering content, “all decisions are made without using political viewpoints, party affiliation, or political ideology,” Dorsey said in his testimony.
“Our Twitter rules are not based on ideology or a particular set of beliefs. We believe strongly in being impartial, and we strive to enforce our Twitter rules fairly.”
Both platforms have begun limiting the reach of many of Trump’s tweets, notably those in which the president rejected his election defeat or questioned the integrity of the voting process.

The group is a community of local enterprises which have transformed the Burren and Cliffs of Moher geopark into a world leader for sustainable tourism.
The award comes amid big changes to the tourism industry during 2020, with Lonely Planet this year opting to recognise places and people demonstrating a commitments to community, diversity and sustainability.
The global travel company unveiled the accolade today as part of Lonely Planet’s ‘Best in Travel’ 2021.
Burren EcoTourism CEO Jarlath O’Dwyer told RTÉ News that the members of the network were “custodians of the landscape” who promoted principles that tourists would not litter or interfere with the Burren.

The award was welcomed by Tourism Ireland CEO Niall Gibbons, who thanked Lonely Planet for the support the group has shown Ireland over the years.
“In what has been a devastating year for travel and tourism, this accolade is really good news and will surely inspire travellers everywhere to put the Burren, Co Clare and the island of Ireland on their holiday wish-list – when the time is right,” he said.

Owen and Bredge Ward, both aged 69, died in Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry today.
The couple, who were from Strabane, had been married for 48 years and had six children and nine grandchildren.
Their son Martin said he held his father’s hand as he died, while his siblings were at the funeral home with his mother.
“This is what the disease does – it can be mild or it can devastate lives,” he told BBC Northern Ireland.
“Within hours, my mum, who was improving, just went downhill. Maybe it was the shock. Fast forward a week and my father was improving and my mother was getting worse.
“She passed away yesterday, then my father, from a position where he was getting better, just completely collapsed and within a couple of hours of my mother dying, he passed away too.”
Martin Ward, who works as a nurse in Galway, added that despite pain relief and care from hospital staff, said his parents “completely collapsed” within a couple of hours.

THE CENTRAL STATISTICS Office has published stats on unemployment up to the third quarter of the year. 
Using the standard International Labour Organisation (ILO) criteria, people aged 15 years and over in employment fell by 1.4% or 31,700 to 2,295,200 in the year to Q3. The employment rate for those aged 15-64 years was 67.7% in Q3.
When the effects of Covid-19 are taken into account, people aged 15 years and over in employment is estimated to have been 2,078,058 at the end of September, with an employment rate of 61.0% for those aged 15-64 years. By the end of October, these are estimated to have stood at 1,965,209 and 57.5% respectively.
By the end of October 2020, the Covid-19 adjusted measure of unemployment is currently estimated to have been 501,640 – with an associated Covid-19 adjusted unemployment rate of 20.2%.

“Today’s figures show that Ireland’s labour market continued to bear the fall-out from Covid-19 and the associated public health restrictions in the third quarter this year. The rise in the LFS unemployment rate to 6.7% in today’s figures shows the impact of the pandemic on people’s livelihoods.
However the rise in total employment and total hours worked in the economy from the second quarter is evidence of the improvement in economic conditions in the third quarter and shows how resilient Ireland’s labour market is.
“The introduction of the Level 5 public health restrictions currently in place has had a significant and rapid impact on our labour market with numbers of claimants for the PUP rising to 350,000 in recent weeks. However, I am encouraged by the fact that, with sectors such as construction and manufacturing remaining open, the rise in the number of people relying on the PUP has stayed well below the peak of 600,000 from early May.
“If we continue our diligent efforts, as we have done to date in reducing the spread of the virus for a second time, many people will return to work once Level 5 restrictions are lifted.”","The Covid-19 adjusted measure of unemployment is currently estimated to have been 501,640 at the end of October.",0,0,1,19063,"Nov 17th 2020, 8:39 PM"

Even though he moved out, his mother would occasionally visit—sometimes to simply sign his report cards at the end of a semester.

Corbyn, who was only informed of the news in the past hour, was readmitted following a meeting of the disputes panel of the party’s ruling National Executive Committee.
Corbyn had the whip withdrawn and was suspended from the party over his response to a damning Equality and Human Rights Commission which found that the party had broken the law in its handling of anti-Semitism complaints.
He had claimed that while “one anti-Semite is one too many” the “scale of the problem was also dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media”.
His suspension came after his successor as Labour leader Keir Starmer said that people who believed it was “exaggerated, or a factional attack” were “part of the problem” and “should be nowhere near the Labour Party either”.
In a tweet this evening, the former Labour leader said: “I am pleased to have been reinstated in the Labour Party and would like to thank party members, trade unionists and all who have offered solidarity.

It is understood that Cabinet will meet as usual on Tuesday, but that it is likely ministers could meet for a second time towards the end of next week so as to assess more up to date virus data. 
The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) are due to meet next Thursday.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin has indicated that he wants to give businesses a couple of days notice on what restrictions might be in place come 1 December, when Level 5 is due to end.
Speaking in the Dáil earlier today, the Taoiseach said the government is making plans to exit Level 5, “which we want to do at the end of this month”.
He reiterated that the government will take on board sectoral recommendations, particularly those in respect of worship and people’s opportunity to attend mass and other services safely during Advent and in the lead-up to Christmas. 
“We want to get back to Level 3, but we will consider certain aspects of it because, as I said earlier, we have done a fair bit of work over recent months to ascertain as best we can the optimal triggers for the spread of the virus. We have worked to understand what particular events have been triggers and what has caused spikes in case numbers,” he said.
“We do not want to open up and then have very high numbers again in January or February. There will be a great focus on personal responsibility and the avoidance of large crowds both indoors and outdoors,” said the Taoiseach.
While the Taoiseach has already indicated that Level 3, with some modifications, is the December target for government, sources have said there is growing worry in government about the increase in case numbers.
There have been increasing calls from Opposition parties, as well as businesses for clarity around what will happen in December.

'We have to get the doors open before Christmas': Retailers and pubs call for clarity on re-opening
Retailers and publicans have called for urgent clarity, saying that they must re-open their doors in December.
Sinn Féin spokesperson on Enterprise, Trade, Employment and Workers’ Rights Louise O’Reilly today called on the government to provide clarity to businesses as to what the Christmas trading period will look like.
“It is necessary that the government keep businesses such as clothes and fashion retailers, pubs, restaurants, book and toy shops, and electronic goods shops informed about ongoing developments as we move through the Level 5 restrictions. They must have some clarity as to what trading for the Christmas period will look like.
“These businesses will have to roster staff, order stock, including perishable food and drink, introduce additional health and safety protections, and arrange opening and closing times, so it is essential that they know what trading will look like.
“Indeed, workers will also have to arrange their lives depending on what the festive period will look like,” she said.
Health Minister Stephen Donnolly said today that huge sacrifices have been made, and last week the reproductive number was down to 0.6. However, over the last week it is clear that people have become fatigued, he said.

We wanted to set up a club night for LGBTQ+ people and their friends with a focus on good music.
We played electronic, synth & disco and our door policy was ‘wear what you like, just be sound and be yourself’.
Since our inception, we’ve worked with GCN, donating 50% profits from our club’s events to the Gay Community News, a registered charity and beloved community resource.
For our first year, the Mother DJs performed to a tiny packed dance floor every Saturday night from decks set up on a semi-circle sofa spun around to resemble a DJ booth.
Inexpensive home-disco style lights we named flashy and blinky flanked them, secured to two tall pod tables with sellotape. And it did the job. We’d launched Mother in what was formerly the basement breakfast room of a Dame Street hotel which had been painted, with a bar and some furniture thrown in to complete the aesthetic. 
A club from scratch
We didn’t have the cash for high-spec lighting, top-of-the-line equipment or even a DJ booth, but we had great DJs and we had a community. We had a small loyal base of regulars who grew to be friends and over time became our extended Saturday night family.

It very much felt like a house party that just happened to be in a club space. Three weeks after we opened, we threw our first iteration of the Pride Block Party.
Knowing absolutely nothing about the intricate and necessary legal and planning processes required to throw outdoor events, we set up some decks on the street outside the club to play tunes for the people out taking a breather, having a cigarette and celebrating pride. Thousands of people showed up and our Pride Block Party was born.
Cut to ten years later. Our club had settled into its third venue, our new Saturday night home, Lost Lane off Grafton St. We were in the midst of planning our tenth birthday party and our tenth Pride Block Party, which was returning to its new home, the National Museum of Ireland at Collins Barracks.

We were honoured to be the first event of its kind ever held at the beautiful, historic space. Close to 10,000 would attend.
While planning these parties we were also working on our second instalment of Love Sensation, an LGBTQ+ music festival we launched on the grounds of the Royal Hospital Kilmainham in the summer of 2019.
Our DJs were also booked to play a myriad of stages across the Irish festival circuit and club scene around the country. We were busy and often stressed, but it was exactly what we wanted to be doing and we loved it.
And then… 2020
When the lockdown hit, naturally all of our events and plans were put on hold. Over the years, with the club and our larger events we’ve met an entire industry of hard-working, like-minded people.
They are sound and lighting engineers, security and safety event management professionals, events suppliers and of course, artists, performers and everyone else involved in events from big to small.

When lockdown hit, their livelihoods were hit first, and hardest with the industry grinding to a halt, without a recovery plan and with no hope or end in sight for when they might next be able to work again.
Without these people our dancefloors would never have been the safe, fun and diverse spaces our community needs them to be, and we will need these people more than ever to ensure that life can again be breathed back into them.
We’re hopeful that the funding announced in the budget will be distributed in a way to best help these workers and to secure the future of the industry. As of yet it seems unclear when or how this will be distributed, so we wait in hope.
The people in the background of these events are the absolute backbone of every dance floor in the country, whether that’s at live shows, festivals, clubs or any number of other types of events. Securing their future is securing ours on the dancefloor.
There is something magical about people being together on a dance floor. It unites us. Whether that dance floor is in a club or in a field under the stars at a festival.
I think for us that feeling multiplies when as queer people we’re surrounded by our community and allies. It’s a safe, fun and diverse space that allows us to unapologetically be ourselves. It’s home.
Throwing parties where this is possible is what we live for and we’ve been so lucky that our small loyal base of regulars, friends, customers and chosen family has grown over the years enabling us to throw larger events, creating new queer spaces across our city.

Clubbing is community
To us, club culture is about shared experience with like-minded people through music, dance and a shared sense of community. That’s what we miss most during these strange, solitary times and it’s what keeps us focussed on getting things back to the way they were, when it’s safe to do so. 
For now we’re focussing on the small things we can do to keep ourselves occupied, from selling merchandise, tops and teeshirts to planning for the future.
We’re working away in the background on the Mother of all come back parties so that when it’s possible to meet again, we’ll be ready to turn on the lights, turn up the tunes and reunite on the dancefloor.
I guess that’s what is keeping us positive through this. We know that this will pass, and we take the lessons we’ve learned from our community and apply them to get us there mentally.

We’re living a bizarre and unexpected shared experience at the moment and in a multitude of different ways, times are tough and strange for everyone. But it’ll get better with time and we will eventually return to normality.
We just need to make sure that no one gets left behind.
It’s been an incredible 10 years for the Mother family and we feel so honoured to still be knocking around, doing our thing. I think one of the key reasons we’ve lasted a decade is the crew involved have become such close friends over the years.
We call ourselves a family because we are one. We know we’ll come through this together, and we will dance again.

Conor Freeman (21) was identified by US Homeland Security as having taken part in the thefts. Dublin Circuit Criminal Court heard that five co-accused are before the courts in the United States.
Following his arrest, Freeman handed over what remained of his share from the theft to gardaí which, due to the increase in value of Bitcoin in the intervening period, is now worth over $2 million (equivalent to around €1.68 million).
Freeman, of Glenageary Court, Dun Laoghaire, Dublin, pleaded guilty to knowingly engaging in the possession of the proceeds of crime – namely 142.75682712 Bitcoin.
He further pleaded guilty to stealing $100,000 in cryptocurrency from Darran Marble on 15 May, 2018, stealing cryptocurrencies with an approximate value of $1,921,335, from Seth Sharpiro on 16 May, 2018, and stealing cryptocurrencies with an approximate value of $167,622.22 from Micheal Templeman on 18 May, 2018.
He also entered guilty pleas to three counts of dishonestly operating a computer to make a gain on dates between 15 and 18 May, 2018. He has no previous convictions.
Passing sentencing today, Judge Martin Nolan said that every system ever developed has its weaknesses because every system has to be user friendly.
The judge said that stealing money of this order is serious because no one can know the effect it will have on the victim.
He noted that Sharpiro’s life savings were taken and the proceeds of the sale of his house were stolen.
He also said there was “almost perfect mitigation” in this case, with factors including Freeman’s guilty plea, his co-operation, his having no previous convictions, his youth, his having abilities which can contribute to society and that he is unlikely to re-offend.
The judge said the crime involved “guile and deception” and that a custodial sentence was warranted despite the mitigation in order to punish the accused, to deter him and to deter others.
He sentenced Freeman to three years imprisonment, but reduced the sentence to two years and 11 months imprisonment to give him credit for time already spent in custody.
Internet handles
At a previous sentencing hearing, Sergeant Tom Anderson told John Berry BL, prosecuting, that Freeman was identified by the United States Department of Homeland Security as being the person behind certain internet handles connected to the offences.
The garda sergeant said that Freeman was part of a group of people who had met online.
This group identified people on social media who they believed might have access to some amount of cryptocurrency.
The group were able to gain access to the email addresses and phone numbers of these people via social media, which was information needed to commit the crimes.
Freeman’s co-conspirators knew people who worked in telecommunications who would transfer the phone numbers of potential victims onto SIM cards purchased by the group.
The co-conspirators would then initiate protocols that are in place in the event of people forgetting their passwords in order to gain access to the online accounts of potential victims.
After his co-conspirators gained access to the email exchanges of these people, Freeman would go through these exchanges and identify sources of cryptocurrencies they possessed.
The proceeds of the thefts would be split evenly between all parties who were involved.
The court heard that there are five co-accused with Freeman who are before the courts in the United States.

Freeman spent a sum of approximately €130,000, which he had converted into cash from the stolen cryptocurrency.
Electronic wallet
Following his arrest, Freeman gave gardaí an electronic wallet which contained the remaining Bitcoin he acquired from the theft.
Bitcoin has accelerated in value since the thefts, leading this amount of cryptocurrency to be currently valued at approximately $2,002,785.
The garda sergeant agreed with Paul O’Carroll SC, defending, that Freeman’s handing over of the electronic wallet and providing of codes to access the funds was “somewhat exceptional assistance”.
The garda sergeant agreed with counsel for Freeman that there was no evidence his client had been in communication with any other members of the group in two years and that Freeman said in interview that he has cut all ties with them.
Counsel said his client was “very much a loner” as a teenager who reverted to an online world.
He said his client started out “hacking” other people’s accounts during online games and that he did so not for monetary gain, but rather for the “thrill”.
Counsel acknowledged that a large amount of money was taken during the criminal enterprise and that the enterprise was “sophisticated”. He described his client’s assistance to the prosecution authorities as “extraordinary”.
The judge said white collar crime “demands a lot of intelligence”, adding that Freeman has a lot of intelligence and that he had misapplied it.","Conor Freeman was jailed for just under three years today.",4,0,0,37241,"Nov 17th 2020, 6:48 PM"

She raised concerns that principals are being told not to inform teachers when a child has tested positive for coronavirus, and that teachers are being instructed to switch off the Covid-19 tracing app while at school.
Conway-Walsh asked: “Are principals being told not to tell the teachers, including the teacher that’s teaching the child in the class?
“Are you concerned that is creating an ethos of secrecy within the school? Not only within the school, but within the community as well, where we have vacuums of information that are then being filled with untruths or not accurate information.”
The minister responded: “I would have to say at the outset, in terms of any adjudication of a case within a school, or a child or a member of staff being impacted by Covid-19, that adjudication is strictly and only conducted by public health and no one else.
“I think it is hugely important that any decisions around public health in the school sector or indeed in wider society are made by public health professionals.
And it is for that reason, and indeed with the support of the parties in education, that schools teams are public health-led and no adjudication as regards what should happen within a school environment is being placed on the shoulders of any school principal or any member of management of a school.
Conway-Walsh questioned if it was appropriate that principals were being told “to keep secret and not to even tell the teacher involved that the teacher will be a close contact as well of the student”.
“And were the teacher to come from a household where they might have high-risk family members within that, that they’re not told that they are a close contact of the student involved?”
Foley replied that “the expertise that rests with public health means that we accept the adjudication of public health”.
She said that at no stage “did any principal or any member of management within the school environment wish to have placed upon them the burden of having to make a public health adjudication”.

“For that reason, public health are the ones that are making the adjudication and no one else within the school environment,” she added.
The minister said teachers are being informed about close contacts “as quickly and as soon as the adjudication has been completed by the public health within the school”.
Conway-Walsh urged her to reconsider the protocols, saying they left people in an “impossible situation”.
“I just want to say that the ethos of secrecy within the schools is putting the principals in an impossible situation, it’s putting parents in an impossible situation and teachers as well,” she said.
In response, the minister asked whether the deputy was suggesting that public health decisions should be made “by the school principal and by management within the school?
“At no stage did I think that was appropriate, and at no stage did management or did school principals ask to have that burden placed upon them,” she said. 
“It was always accepted that adjudication in terms of Covid-19 would have to be made by those who are expert in that field.”","Norma Foley said decisions around informing close contacts should not be made by principals.",19,0,0,30030,"Nov 17th 2020, 6:43 PM"

Netflix’s hit show is pretty simple in its concept but exceptionally expensive in its execution. The Crown follows the life and reign of Queen Elizabeth II and the new fourth season is probably the most anticipated yet. 
That’s because we’ve now reached the Charles and Diana years with Gillian Anderson joining the cast as Margaret Thatcher.
For Irish viewers, the first episode has caused a stir online as it features a depiction of the IRA bomb attack in Sligo that killed Louis Mountbatten and three others.

A MAN IN his 40s has been arrested after drugs, alcohol and mobile phones were discovered at Mountjoy Prison destined for prisoners belonging to the Kinahan cartel.
Cocaine with an estimated value of €140,000, tablets believed to be worth up to €20,000 and €5,000 in suspected cannabis were all discovered during the search, along with a small quantity of steroids, alcohol and 30 mobile phones.
The discovery was made following a security operation led by prison staff with the support of the operational support group (OSG) based in the prison. 
The arrested man was taken to Mountjoy garda station, where he is being detained under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984.
The Irish Prison Service (IPS) said it is the largest single seizure of contraband into a prison in Ireland.
Multiple sources have said to TheJournal.ie that the contraband was destined for the D Wing in Mountjoy – where many of the Kinahan cartel’s low-level criminals are being held.
The IPS said the goods were seized from a van following a security operation led by prison staff with the support of the OSG based in the prison.

The OSG is a prison’s intelligence service. It monitors communication between prisoners and the outside world and raises an alert with prison management if there is a suspicion that contraband is to be smuggled onto the campus.
The contraband was discovered in a number of food boxes. 
The driver of the van has been detained for questioning but sources say he appears to be “completely confused” about what happened, and so far nothing has been discovered to indicate he had any knowledge of the illicit cargo prior to the seizure.
Gardaí and prison officers believe the stash of drugs and other illegal items were to be delivered to the kitchen area where a prisoner with access to the facilities was to distribute them.

The Director General of the Irish Prison Service Caron McCaffrey said this morning’s operation was “a very significant result” in the effort to “prevent dangerous contraband from entering the prison”.
“Given the scale of the contraband seized it is highly possible that these drugs, if they had made their way into the prison population, could have had a devastating impact on the prison population including the potential for the loss of life by overdose,” McCaffrey said.

The white giraffe now stands alone after a female and her calf were killed by poachers in March in a major blow for the rare animals found nowhere else in the world.
The bodies of the two giraffes were found “in a skeletal state after being killed by armed poachers” in Garissa in eastern Kenya, the Ishaqbini Hirola Community Conservancy said earlier this year.
Their deaths left just one remaining white giraffe alive: a lone male, borne by the same slaughtered female.
Now the GPS tracking device, attached to one of the giraffe’s horns, will ping every hour to alert wildlife rangers to its location.
The conservancy has thanked the Kenya Wildlife Service along with the Northern Rangelands Trust and Save Giraffes Now for the help.
The female white giraffe stirred huge interest in 2017 when she was first spotted on the conservancy and again when she birthed two calves, the latest in August last year.
Their alabaster colour is caused not by albinism but a condition known as leucism, which means they continue to produce dark pigment in their soft tissue, giving them dark eyes.

HEALTH MINISTER STEPHEN Donnelly has said large crowds gathering outside drinking alcohol has only really “taken off at scale” over the last number of days. 
In an attempt to explain why the government has done two u-turns in the space of 24 hours in relation to a crackdown on people drinking takeaway pints outside, the minister said he wanted to “act quickly” in tackling the issue. 
When pointed out to him on RTÉ’s Six One News that perhaps it was not a growing phenomenon and that people have been enjoying drinks outside throughout the pandemic, the minister said: 
“We haven’t had a situation before whereby people have been gathering in large crowds drinking outside.”
Plans to give gardaí new powers to fine people who gather outside to drink alcohol were shelved by Cabinet today. 
Ministers instead decided to focus on the enforcement of existing rules which govern the consumption of alcohol in a public space.
It is understood Micheál Martin, Leo Varadkar and Eamon Ryan met prior to Cabinet to discuss the proposals being floated by Donnelly.
Ultimately, a memo prepared by Donnelly on the initiative was not brought to Cabinet in the end.
Speaking on the Six One News this evening, Donnelly said large crowds meeting up to drink outside together was “against the spirit and the letter of the regulations”. 
He said there was a “productive discussion” Cabinet members today, with broad agreement that the focus should be on the enforcement of existing rules which govern the consumption of alcohol in a public space.
It is understood the proposals for fines were “stood down and withdrawn” at Cabinet this morning amid opposition from Fine Gael and Green Party ministers to Health Minister Stephen Donnelly’s plans.

Speaking to reporters this afternoon Arts and Culture Minister Catherine Martin said the idea of banning takeaway pints was not “bringing people with us”.
She said there was agreement around the Cabinet table today enforcement of the current laws should be looked at before the introduction of any new legislation.
However, she also warned that there seems to be a sense of complacency creeping in. She said there was no-knee jerk reaction, but that ministers felt new laws were unnecessary.
U-turn 
This is a second u-turn by the government on the issue in the last 24 hours. 
Lengthy discussions took place last night about a memo the Fianna Fáil minister planned to bring to Cabinet about people drinking outside. 
It emerged yesterday that the health minister was in favour of an all out ban on takeaway pints and other alcoholic drinks which was mooted yesterday as part of a new crackdown on people gathering outdoors to drink.
Despite reports that moves were being made by Donnelly to introduce at outright ban on takeaway drinks, it emerged that a number of Cabinet ministers had no knowledge of the plan yesterday.
After much discussion about the matter at government level last night, it emerged that new draft regulations for fines rather than a ban would be brought to Cabinet today, after some government sources stated they had concerns that such a measure would not be workable.
However, such plans have now been scrapped.
Speaking in the Dáil today, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said that greater enforcement would now be prioritised. 
“The scenes of last weeked and the previous week where large crowds had gathered outside of takeaway facilities is problematic in terms of the overall messaging and maintaining confidence in the sacrifices and underpinning the sacrifices that people have made,” he said.
“We need to acknowledge that. And that’s why enforcement is important, of existing laws, and we will have further engagement with gardaí in relation to that but I think the key point is that the issue needs to be highlighted and needs to be responded to.
Existing laws
Cabinet ministers have decided that the focus should remain on enforcing existing laws which already state it is an offence to consume alcohol bought in a closed container (like a bottle or can) within 100 metres of an off-licence or pub where it was sold.
The existing law does not forbid a pub from delivering drinks to people’s homes, or allowing customers to bring drinks home.
However, it does allow for a person who consumes any alcohol within 100 metres of where they bought it liable to be fined up €300. A licence holder is subject to a fine not exceeding €1,500 if they consent to someone drinking within 100 metres of the premises. 
Cabinet members highlighted today that it is already illegal to drink on the streets of Dublin and Cork, while it is also against public health regulations under Level 5 to be more than 5km from your home.
Under Level 5 restrictions, pubs cannot open for customers but are allowed to operate on a takeaway basis.
Drinking outdoors is not prohibited in general but many city and county councils have bye-laws that forbid drinking in some or all public places.
Yesterday, the Taoiseach confirmed the government would review the selling of takeaway pints from pubs due to a number of instances of people congregating in defiance of public health guidelines.

Micheál Martin spoke with the Minister for Justice Helen McEntee and Health Minister Stephen Donnelly about the matter yesterday, as well as seeking advice from An Garda Síochána.
It is understood that the issue of enforcement of the current regulations was raised during those discussions yesterday, as were options on how to deal with offending pubs under the current rules.
Social media
The Taoiseach’s comments yesterday came as videos of people gathering on Dublin’s South William Street and Cork’s Patrick Street and Coal Quay were shared online and generated news coverage. 
Yesterday, there appeared to be significant opposition to the planned ban on takeaway drinks. While some said it was clear that a number of publicans are not following the “spirit” of the current rules, they said a ban was not the answer.
A number of senior government sources said that only a small number of publicans are flouting the rules, and that it would be unfair to end the sale of all takeaway drinks due to the actions of a few.
Another said it is illegal to drink on the street in most areas, insisting that enforcement is the solution, not an outright ban, adding that they would not be in favour of preventing local pubs from providing takeaway.
However, one health source defended the proposal, saying it is “very hard” to police the current rules around preventing people drinking alcohol purchased within 100 metres.
One source said there were similar discussions a number of weeks ago about the shutting off licenses and that that had come to nothing.
While a number of government sources raised concerns about the mooted ban, backbench TDs were also raising red flags yesterday evening.
Fianna Fáil’s Barry Cowen tweeted yesterday evening: 
Brian Foley of the Vintners Federation of Ireland (VFI) insisted some people who are drinking outdoors are getting alcohol from off licences, rather than pubs.
He said any pubs that break guidelines should be “dealt with”, but added that “the vast majority of publicans are following the guidelines”.","Cabinet abandoned plans to introduce fines for drinking takeaway pints outside today.",28,0,0,68881,"Nov 17th 2020, 12:06 AM"

Coveney’s comments come as the Israel Land Authority issued construction tenders in Givat Hamatos, a currently uninhabited area of east Jerusalem next to the mainly Palestinian neighbourhood of Beit Safafa.
Israel seized east Jerusalem in the 1967 Six-Day War. It later annexed it in a move never recognised by the international community.
Jewish settlements in east Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank are also considered illegal by most foreign governments and the United Nations.
In February, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the approval of 3,000 homes in the area and Israel is now pushing ahead with the plans. He said  2,000 homes would be allocated for Jews and 1,000 for Arab residents of Beit Safafa.
It’s believed that construction of the settlements is now being fast-tracked before US President Donald Trump leaves office.
The Trump administration has broken with decades of bipartisan US practice by not opposing Jewish settlement activity in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem. 
President-elect Joe Biden has said his administration will restore US opposition illegal settlements. 
In a statement today, Coveney said that officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs met with the Israeli Ambassador to “underline Ireland’s serious concerns” over the expansion of settlements in the “strategically sensitive area”.
“This announcement by Israel undermines the viability and territorial contiguity of a future Palestinian State and the possibility of a negotiated two-state solution in line with the internationally agreed parameters with Jerusalem as the future capital of two states,” the minister said.
Settlement activity in the occupied Palestinian territory is clearly illegal under international law. This action erodes trust and confidence between the parties, which is critical for the resumption of meaningful negotiations. We are again at a very sensitive time, when maximum restraint must be shown by all sides. I call upon the Israeli government to reverse this decision and to halt all settlement construction.

Nabil Abu Rudeina, a spokesman for Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, said the Givat Hamatos tenders amounted to an attempt by Israel “to kill the internationally-supported two state solution”.
Yesterday, EU diplomats were taunted by right-wing Israeli protesters as they visited the site of the proposed settlement.  
Several European Union envoys who had travelled to Givat Hamatos were called “anti-Semites” by shouting protesters. “EU shame on you,” protesters shouted as diplomats tried to speak.
The east Jerusalem tenders follow the approval of 96 new east Jerusalem settler homes in the Ramat Shlomo neighbourhood last week.

Part-time cleaner Bridget Kenneally (49) of Duncoran in Youghal, Co Cork pleaded guilty to one count of assault of Cora Desmond at Kenny’s Lane in Youghal on a date between 1 October and 31 October 2009.
She was sentenced on a background of abusing Cora Desmond for over 10 years.
Desmond, now aged 21, gave a powerful victim impact statement at a sentencing hearing in Cork Circuit Criminal Court today.
She detailed the abuse which occurred at the hands of Kenneally from when she was between the ages of six and 16.
Judge Sean O’Donnabhain heard that when she was five, Desmond’s father – who had full custody of her – entered into a relationship with Kenneally.
Kenneally initially seemed “nice and caring”, she said, adding that this didn’t last long.
“About six months in to the 11-year relationship, the horrific abuse began with a few slaps and punches but then gradually got worse,” Desmond told the court.
“Throughout the years it became clear to me that I was nothing but a punching bag to Bridget.”
The court was also told that Kenneally’s children could spend time with friends of their choosing, but that Desmond and her sister were refused the same freedom, instead being confined to their residence to clean up after Kenneally and her children.
“Bridget gave me the name Cora Ella and told me I was just like Cinderella because I was the one who was not wanted or loved,” Desmond said.
She told the court that she lived a double life for 11 years, saying she was “happy, free and bubbly” in school while feeling trapped at home as she awaited her next beating or punishment.
“For 11 years she told me no one would believe me if I spoke out regarding the vile, sadistic, physical and mental torture she subjected me to,” Desmond said.
“I was made to lie about my injuries and tell people I was just a clumsy child. One of the many lies I had to tell was how I broke my thumb. The real truth is she broke it. She twisted my hand so much that it actually snapped the bone.”
Mental and physical torture
Desmond also told the court that on one occasion, she was hospitalised after the right side of her head and face swelled following a beating.
She claimed Kenneally made her tell doctors that she hit her head in Funderland, which she had attended two weeks previously.
The supermarket worker, who said she is extremely grateful to gardaí for the sensitivity shown to her in the lead up to the case, told the court that her childhood involved mental and physical torture.
“[During] one of the recurring daily punishments, she would feed me excessive amounts of salt, pepper, mustard, chilli powder and vinegar,” Desmond said.
“Since my departure from her care, I have long-lasting negative reactions to certain smells and tastes. It brings back memories and flashbacks of the torture she put me through.
“There were constant verbal threats that she would kill me if I ever told anyone of the abuse I endured.”
Desmond said that because of the “heinous crime of cruelty” inflicted on her, she suffers from depression and is afraid to go anywhere on her own.
“You robbed me of my carefree childhood that every child is entitled to. I now understand that none of it was my fault and I didn’t deserve any of it though that is what she made me believe,” she said.
Beaten with pokers
Meanwhile, Garda Sergeant Mark Ward said that during the abuse, Cora Desmond was regularly beaten with pokers, sticks of the vacuum cleaner, belts and spatulas.
The court was told that Desmond was hospitalised for a week in 2008 as a result of her injuries.
The garda said that Kenneally called her step-daughter a variation of Cinderella and treated her and her sister differently from her biological children.
He also explained that Desmond was afraid to reveal the abuse, as Bridget Kenneally told her she would be split from her sibling if she did so.

Concerns were raised over the years by a principal of a national school she attended and on one occasion, a GP found 50 bruises on her body.
Kenneally was eventually interviewed informally in 2016 and arrested in 2017 after a complaint had been made against her. She made no admissions to gardaí but eventually entered a guilty plea in the case.
The garda sergeant said that the guilty plea was of assistance to the court given that a trial would have involved 14 witnesses.
Barrister Patrick O’Riordan, who was representing Kenneally, said that his client had entered a guilty plea and had paid €5,000 in compensation. He also noted that she was a woman without previous convictions.
Counsel told the court that Kenneally had six children in her care at the time of the offences and was experiencing difficulty coping.
He said his client had “a protracted pyschiatric history” and wanted to apologise to the victim in the case.
The judge asked Desmond if she felt the apology was genuine. Desmond said she didn’t believe that Kenneally was remorseful for her actions.
Taking the entirety of the abuse in to consideration, the judge said a custodial sentence was warranted.
“This was a case of continued brutality. This was systemic abuse and cruelty. She (Cora) was deprived of a childhood because of the pain and misery she was subjected to,” he said.
Judge O’Donnabhain jailed Kenneally for two years saying that he was horrified by the tale of hospitalisation and force feeding of the victim.
Following the sentencing Cora Desmond urged other victims of child abuse to come forward.
“I thought I was wasting my time and she would get away with what she done to me but thankfully I got some sort of justice,” she said.
“It is something. I would say to people to speak up. Don’t be afraid to tell someone. Tell someone and get out of the situation sooner rather than later. I was six when it started and sixteen when it finished.

587,180,"Government's Covid plan could be 'tweaked' to allow arts and entertainment venues open safely, says minister",https://www.thejournal.ie/museums-cultural-institutions-tweaking-covid-plans-5270010-Nov2020/,"OFFICIALS ARE ENGAGING on the possibility of modifying the government’s Living with Covid-19 plan to allow for the safe reopening of arts and entertainment venues.
Arts and Culture Minister Catherine Martin said today that she is aware from her engagement with cultural institutions and venues that there are concerns that some levels are too restrictive in terms of attendance numbers permitted, and the closure of some museums.
“There is ongoing engagement with my officials, officials from the Department of Health and the Taoiseach’s Department to see what can be done there,” she said. 
She said negotiations are ongoing at present to see can there be a “tweaking of levels”, so that the “individuality of each venue and cultural institution” can be assessed on its own merits in terms of opening up access.
‘Urgent review of Covid plan’
A report from the government’s arts and culture recovery task force, which was presented to Cabinet by the minister today, finds that the treatment of cultural activities and venues under the various levels of the government’s Living with Covid-19 plan “requires urgent review to better reflect actual circumstances and the particular behaviours of artists, audiences and venues”.
It calls for a representative stakeholders group to be established so that cultural providers can engage with public health experts to design guidance and support mechanisms for the re-introduction of safe public engagement in cultural activity.
The Taoiseach has already indicated that the aim after Level 5 is to reopen the economy under Level 3, with some modifications.
Under Level 3, all museums, galleries and other cultural attractions must remain closed.
Bars or pubs serving food or wet pubs, many of which are also live music venues, can have outdoor dining with an absolute maximum of 15 people.
Under Level 2, museums, cinemas, theatres and art galleries are deemed to be controlled environments, and allowed to open with appropriate protective measures in place such as physical distancing between people.
Individual groupings attending these venues must be limited to six people from no more than three households, while overall attendance must adhere to an overall limit of 50 people.
Musical performances can take place in a theatre subject to compliance with all broader public health guidance. All other indoor cultural events are subject to the SIX person maximum rule. All outdoor events are limited to 15 people.
Chairperson of the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce, Clare Duignan, said the group felt “quite strongly” that there is a need for stakeholders to be brought into the discussion with public health experts in terms of what can reopen.

She said there is great health and safety expertise in the arts sector, stating that for many it is their sole profession.
Large spaces, very limited numbers
Duignan said many cultural institutions “tend to be in large spaces” that are very well aerated, where it is “very easy to control numbers”.
She said workers in the arts sector should be allowed to get around the table with public health experts to talk “some of this through” so it may be “possible to reconsider some of the guidance that is there at present”.
The minister acknowledged that the voice of the arts workers “needs to be heard on this”.
Similar to an expert group that has been established on reopening sports events, there is a need for arts voices to feed into the regulations, said Martin.","An arts task force says the Living with Covid plan requires an urgent review.",10,0,1,12502,"Nov 17th 2020, 4:45 PM"
588,221,"Covid-19: NPHET members called for more enforcement of Level 3 measures before proposed move to Level 5",https://www.thejournal.ie/nphet-level-3-enforcement-level-5-covid-19-restrictions-5269904-Nov2020/,"MEMBERS OF THE National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) suggested stricter enforcement of Level 3 measures to curb the spread of Covid-19 when the team met to recommend the introduction of Level 5 measures last month.
Minutes of a NPHET meeting held on 15 October show that some members believed that greater levels of compliance with Level 3 restrictions were required before a move to a higher level of the Living with Covid plan.
The meeting was held the same day that Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan wrote to Health Minister Stephen Donnelly to recommend Level 5 restrictions for six weeks.
In his letter, Holohan noted his concern about the escalating number of cases in Ireland and across Europe, and expressed concerns about hospital capacity, community transmission and a rise in clusters at the time.
During the meeting, the team reviewed ongoing Level 3 measures, which were then in place across the country, including in Dublin for a month and in Donegal for three weeks.
Although the restrictions had only been implemented in the 24 other counties a week previously, NPHET said that it was “not satisfied” that Level 3 was having an impact.
It was noted that since being introduced on 4 October, the spread of Covid-19 appeared to be increasing, with “widespread community transmission evident across the country”.
At the time, the five-day average of cases was 946 cases per day, compared with a five-day average of around 400 cases per day now.
The 14-day incidence per 100,000 population was 207 (compared with the current figure of 120.44 cases per 100,000 people), and the R number was 1.4.
However, Holohan asked NPHET members whether they believed Level 3 restrictions should continue to see if a fuller picture of the effects of the measures could be obtained.
A number of unnamed members suggested that Level 3 restrictions “could potentially be sufficient” with full compliance and enforcement.

But following a discussion, NPHET agreed that delaying stricter measures would have been problematic because of the potential spread of the virus.

“Accounting for the current profile and trajectory of the disease, modelling projections, the level of demand across the health system, the NPHET, on balance, concluded that delaying escalation would pose too great a risk,” the minutes read.
Holohan then asked members of NPHET whether they thought Level 4 restrictions should be implemented.
Some members responded that Level 4 would be a “more proportionate response” to address the spread of the virus.
But NPHET again agreed to recommend a move to Level 5 instead. 
“Given the risk associated with Covid-19 spreading further to achieve this, NPHET reached a consensus that implementing Level 5 measures was both necessary and proportionate,” the minutes read.
The team noted that all the criteria for an escalation to Level 5 of the Plan for Living with Covid-19 were being met, as they were on 4 October when Level 5 restrictions were first recommended to the Government.
It was estimated that a two-week delay in introducing Level measures, with the R number at 1.4, would have lead to an additional 24,000 cases of Covid-19, around 1,000 hospitalisations, 140 admissions to ICU and 120 further deaths.

NPHET added that further investment in the State’s public health response system and ensuring there was capacity in the health service to deal with Covid-19 cases were essential after Level 5 restrictions are lifted.
The restrictions were subsequently introduced on 22 October and remain in place until 1 December.","The suggestion was made at a meeting of the public health team last month.",4,0,0,33226,"Nov 17th 2020, 4:19 PM"
589,183,"Taoiseach defends nomination of former Senator and ex-NAGP lobbyist Geraldine Feeney to Sipo",https://www.thejournal.ie/taoiseach-sipo-geraldine-feeney-5269815-Nov2020/,"TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has defended the government’s nomination of former Senator and ex-NAGP lobbyist Geraldine Feeney to a position on the Standards in Public Office Commission (Sipo).
A motion to approve Feeney’s appointment will be put before the Dáil tomorrow night.
No debate will be held on the motion, despite objection to this by opposition politicians. 
Representatives from both Sinn Féin and the Social Democrats were among those to criticise the government for not facilitating a debate on the nomination. 
Feeney is a former Fianna Fáil Senator who is being nominated by the government for one of the two vacant positions on political ethics watchdog Sipo. 
The other nominee is Justice Garrett Sheehan, whose nomination was not objected to in the Dáil and who will become Sipo chairperson. 
The position being filled by Feeney is required to be filled by a former member of the Oireachtas. 
Deputy Paul Murphy last week asked Sipo to investigate if Tánaiste Leo Varadkar had breached the code of conduct for office holders when he passed a confidential document to former NAPG president Maitiú Ó Tuathail. 
The now defunct NAGP union came into existence in 2013 but went into liquidation in 2019.
Feeney is listed on the State’s lobbying register as a former lobbyist who had lobbied on behalf of the NAGP in 2017 and 2018, including a meeting with now Taoiseach Micheál Martin in May 2017. 
In the Dáil today, the Taoiseach said that ”notwithstanding” the current NAGP controversy Feeney’s appointment is “in line with the requirements of the legislation”.
Feeney had been a member of Seanad Éireann from 2002-2011 and Martin defended his former colleague today, saying some of the comments made about her nomination were regrettable.   
“She is a competent person who acted with integrity at all times and I regret some of the comments that have been made in respect of the former Senator, I don’t think that’s merited,” he said.
And people are not debarred from serving on the commission because of one particular issue one particular time. She is eligible, she has experienced as a public and the people who served with her in the Seanad would accept her fairness and integrity.
Sinn Féin TD Pearse Doherty described it as “breathtaking arrogance” that the government would not facilitate a debate on the appointment. He also queried whether Feeney had made all the necessary filings to Sipo.

Speaking in the Seanad earlier today, Sinn Féin Senator Paul Gavan said that no representative should accept the lack of debate on the appointment. 
“The Sinn Féin Seanad team pushed the issue to a vote. But Fianna Fail, Fine Gael and Green Senators combined to prevent any debate on the issue,” he said.
“This is of course yet another example of the cosy insider club that operates across the body politic.”
Speaking to reporters this morning Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy said that questions over Feeney’s lobbying in the past needed to be answered, particularly in light of the request to Sipo in relation to the NAGP.
“I would have thought that a great deal of care needs to be taken when people are being appointed to something like the Standards and Public Office Commission because that is the body that owns everybody else to account,” she said. 
“The very fact of lobbying had been done in relation to that organization where there is a complaint already gone. I would have thought was it was going to be an obvious question that would have been asked.”","Opposition parties have criticised the government for not facilitating a debate on the nomination.",156,0,0,16024,"Nov 17th 2020, 4:06 PM"

Johnson took a rapid turnaround lateral flow test as part of a pilot scheme for No 10 staff.
“The PM took a test yesterday and that test was negative,” the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said.
“But he will, in accordance with the rules on self-isolation, continue to self-isolate.”
The Prime Minister has been shut in Downing Street since he received an email saying Tory MP Lee Anderson – who he hosted for a breakfast meeting last Thursday – had tested positive.
Johnson will answer Prime Minister’s Questions remotely tomorrow, Downing Street said.
He is working from an office in No 10 that he can reach from his flat in No 11 without coming into contact with Downing Street staff.
The Prime Minister has already had a serious case of Covid-19, which left him in intensive care, and has declared he is “bursting with antibodies”.
But No 10 insisted he would continue to follow the rules on self-isolation, which will keep him inside Downing Street until 14 days have elapsed since his meeting with Anderson.
The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said:
The rules have been carefully drawn up on the basis of the best existing medical advice and that is if you have come into contact with someone who later tests positive for coronavirus you do need to self-isolate for a period of 14 days from that first contact.
“It’s also the current medical assessment that the fact you have had coronavirus doesn’t remove that requirement to self-isolate.
“The rules are the same for everybody in every part of the country and the Prime Minister is following them, the same as every other member of the public.”

Byrne condemned the continued use of state violence against the Belarusian people, marking 100 days since mass protests began after authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko won his sixth term in a widely disputed election.
On behalf of the government, Byrne urged Belarusian authorities to end the repression of their citizens, and to seek a peaceful and democratic resolution of the current crisis. 
“Ireland is deeply troubled by threats made by the Belarusian authorities to take away the children of parents who protest. We share the concerns of UN Special Rapporteurs who have highlighted continued violations of children’s rights and the persecution of female human rights defenders in the country,” said Byrne. 
“The people of Belarus alone hold the right to determine the future of their country and a prosperous Belarus is only possible with their consent.”
More than 2,000 pensioners marched in the Belarusian capital Minsk yesterday, demanding the resignation of Lukashenko and a halt to the government’s violent crackdown on dissent.
They carried flowers and red and white flags that have become a symbol of protest.
“Lukashenko, you and my children will remember this disgrace,” said one of the banners the retirees carried.
Such protests have rocked Belarus ever since the 9 August election handed Lukashenko a crushing victory over his widely popular opponent 
She and her supporters refused to recognise the result, saying the vote was riddled with fraud.
Both sides seem to be locked into a continuing cycle of protests and crackdowns, with the opposition turning out thousands in regular marches while the government uses arrests and other intimidation tactics to quash any threats to Lukashenko’s 26-year hold on power.
A nationwide strike called by the opposition did not catch on, although students boycotted classes for a few days.
Authorities have cracked down hard on the largely peaceful demonstrations, the largest of which attracted up to 200,000 people.
Police used stun grenades, tear gas and truncheons to disperse the rallies and detained thousands, beating many of them brutally.
According to human rights advocates, more than 19,000 people have been detained since the election.
At least four people are reported to have died as a result of the crackdown.

Retirees at Monday’s march in Minsk carried portraits of Raman Bandarenka, a 31-year-old opposition supporter who died last week after reportedly being beaten by security forces.
“Why was (Raman) killed?” they chanted, demanding a criminal investigation into his death.
Police did not interfere with the march but harshly dispersed a demonstration in Bandarenka’s memory on Sunday, using stun grenades, tear gas and clubs and beating up protesters in shops and restaurants where they were hiding from the crackdown.
The Interior Ministry said more than 700 people were detained on Sunday across the country, while the Viasna human rights centre put the figure at 1,291.
The continued clampdown elicited international outrage.

Steffen Seibert, a spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel, accused Belarusian authorities of “brutal police violence”.
“This must end,” he said.
“The German government won’t forget how people there are mistreated almost daily on the streets, and we will also not forget those who are kidnapped daily and exposed to even worse abuse behind prison walls.”
Tsikhanouskaya, who is in exile in Lithuania after fleeing Belarus for her safety, called on the West to “act faster”. “Belarusians need help right now,” she tweeted.
“Expand the sanction list (and) impose economic restrictions. Help those repressed (and) injured. Support media (and) human rights defenders. Stop investing in banks (and) state-owned companies. Start international investigation and tribunal,” she wrote.
On a visit to Stockholm for talks with Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde, Tikhanovskaya pleaded for an international investigation in the death of Bandarenka.
“If we have no law in our country, if we have no justice in our country, we are appealing for international help and countries where democracy prevails, where law prevails, to try to help us,” she said in an interview with AFP.

Defence counsel Michael O’Higgins SC, for one of the accused men who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the non-jury court this morning that he would be applying for the trial to be adjourned as it was inappropriate for it to proceed when the law on the retention of mobile phone records was “unknown”.
Luke O’Reilly (66), with an address at Mullahoran Lower, Kilcogy, Co Cavan; Darren Redmond (25), from Caledon Road, East Wall, Dublin 3; Alan O’Brien (39), of Shelmalier Road, East Wall, Dublin 3 and the fourth accused are all charged with false imprisonment and assault causing serious harm to Lunney at Drumbrade, Ballinagh, Co Cavan on 17 September 2019.
Lunney (50), a father of six, was abducted close to his home in Co Fermanagh on the evening of 17 September. The businessman’s leg was broken, he was doused in bleach and the letters QIH were carved into his chest during the two-and-a-half-hour ordeal before he was dumped on a roadside in Co Cavan.
The four defendants were sent forward for trial before the Special Criminal Court last March and the non-jury court has fixed 11 January 2021 as their trial date. It is expected to last 12 weeks.
O’Higgins told the three-judge court today that from his point of view the case was not ready to proceed in January and he was applying for an adjournment.
The barrister handed a document into the court upon which the adjournment application was sought and remarked that the law on the retention and accessing of mobile phone data is in “a state of significant uncertainty” in this jurisdiction.
Justice Tony Hunt presiding, sitting with Judge Martin Nolan and Judge Michael Walsh, said the law was not in any state of uncertainty and asked O’Higgins if the application referred to the recent decision of The European Court of Justice (ECJ) in October.
O’Higgins confirmed that it did and said he had set out in the document the reasons why it was inappropriate for the trial to proceed especially when the law on the retention of mobile phone records was “unknown”.
Last year, the Supreme Court heard an appeal against a High Court ruling in favour of Graham Dwyer which formed part of his bid to overturn his conviction for the murder of childcare worker Elaine O’Hara.
The State had appealed the decision by High Court judge Justice Tony O’Connor that part of Ireland’s retention laws concerning information generated by telephones contravened EU law. Dwyer claimed that data generated from a phone under the 2011 Communications (Retention of Data) Act should not have been used at his 2015 trial before the Central Criminal Court.

Dwyer’s mobile phone data battle was referred from the Supreme Court to the ECJ earlier this year as the superior court found that EU law at the time was not clear enough for a judgment to be made.

The ECJ has ruled in two similar cases recently that member states and service providers do not have broad rights to retain data on citizens and Irish officials now believe the ECJ is likely to rule against the State on that issue.
In light of its recent rulings, the ECJ asked the Supreme Court if it wished to proceed with its referral of the Dwyer case. The Supreme Court responded that it wished the case to proceed as there were additional issues raised by the referral. The ECJ hearing is expected to begin in mid-January and once it rules, which may take some time, the matter will be referred back to the Irish Supreme Court for further argument and judgment.
Earlier this month, the Special Criminal Court heard that the trial of the four accused men may not go ahead next January due to High Court challenges being brought by the defendants against the Special Criminal Court’s jurisdiction to try the matter.
O’Higgins told the non-jury court today that the judicial review proceedings were back before the High Court this morning and outlined that it was “a very net issue”.
Sean Guerin SC, on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), asked the court for time so that the Director could set out her position in relation to the issue of retention of mobile phone data. “The Director is very anxious to get the case on,” he added.

THE TAOISEACH HAS confirmed that the government will be taking “no further steps” in the ongoing controversy over Seámus Woulfe’s position on the Supreme Court. 
The decision was taken at Cabinet this morning and effectively rules out an impeachment motion being moved by the government. A member of the opposition can still put down such a motion, however.
Today’s Cabinet decision also makes it unlikely that any such impeachment motion moved by the opposition would garner support from coalition parties. 
Confirming the government’s decision in the Dáil this afternoon, Micheál Martin said that the standard set down to remove a judge was “a deliberately high constitutional standard”. 
It follows on from a letter published by Chief Justice Frank Clarke to Woulfe, where he stated that his personal opinion that Woulfe should resign his position in the wake of the controversy caused by his attendance at the ‘Golfgate’ dinner. 
In the Dáil today, Martin said that the judiciary has undertaken a “transparent and comprehensive process” following Woulfe’s attendance at the dinner. 
“The government fully supports the Supreme Court and recognises the importance of protecting its collegiate nature and its concern to maintain the highest standards,” the Taoiseach said.
The government notes the important distinction between a resignation and the deliberately high constitutional standard of removal for stated misbehaviour. After very careful consideration, and having listened to the opposition leaders on this matter, the government believes the constitutional protection of the judiciary is best achieved in this particular case by taking no further steps in this matter.  
Responding to the Taoiseach’s statement, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said that the Chief Justice’s opinion on Woulfe’s position “remains problematic”. 
“I believe there ought to be some mediated solution to this particular issue,” she said.

Last week, the Taoiseach met with leaders of the opposition to discuss what approach might collectively be taken to deal with the Woulfe controversy. However, no consensus on how to break the impasse was reached.

“It undermines what was done, I’d be quite reluctant to get involved in another group if you were to do the same thing on another issue, because it seems like the best Friday was a fishing exercise,” Kelly said.
The decision taken by government today at Cabinet will also mean that the focus on the appointment process of Woulfe to the Supreme Court will now take prominence.
The government is facing mounting pressure from the Opposition to facilitate a question and answer session with Minister for Justice Helen McEntee on the appointment of Woulfe to the Supreme Court earlier this year.
In a statement, McEntee told TDs that only one judge’s name is ever given to Cabinet where judicial appointments are concerned.

“Based on that recommendation, which came through the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board – which is an independent board – that name was approved by Cabinet,” she said.
“It’s important to say that there was a very clear process. As Minister for Justice, I adhered to that process.”
A number of parties and groupings such as Sinn Fein, Labour, the Social Democrats and the Rural Independent Group are all seeking Dáil time to be set aside for questions to be answered.
Opposition have concerns about the selection process, after it emerged last week that Cabinet was not told in July that a number of other judges had expressed interest in the vacancy on the Supreme Court before Woulfe was selected.
Speaking on the matter last week, the Taoiseach said only one name is brought to Cabinet when a judge is being appointed.
Woulfe had come through the Judicial Appointments advisory board (JAB) process, he said. He said he was not told other judges had expressed interest.
He said the advisory board is made up of senior judges themselves, and they had selected Woulfe. “As far as I’m concerned, that was it from from my perspective,” said Martin, adding that he had “no difficulty in ratifying that”.
Speaking this morning, ahead of what is expected to be a heated Order of Business session in the Dail, Sinn Féin Chief Whip Pádraig Mac Lochlainn said:
“We don’t intend to just leave it at that there will be votes today on the order of business. But it will continue in the weeks ahead until the Minister comes into the Dáil on to account for the process that led to this decision.”

Meanwhile, Labour leader Alan Kelly said:
“I believe the government have to allow questions today so we can deal with this once and for all, and find out transparently. I believe the Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has a very big choice today, regarding what she articulates to the houses regarding this process.”
Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy said McEntee should come to the Dail to outline the judicial appointments process.
“It’s not at all clear what weighting is given between the judicial appointments process and the direct application by judges,” she said.
“I think it’s absolutely essential the Minister for Justice comes in and explains that in order that we can do our job and hold them to account.”

His barrister had argued that the trial was unfair because of the doctor’s age (86) and that the judge had erred in telling the jury that if there was no collusion, then the fact there were seven complainants was “compelling” evidence.
The doctor, who cannot be identified by order of the Court of Appeal, was jailed for four years in February of last year.
He had pleaded not guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to 12 charges of indecent assault and one charge of sexual assault committed during medical examinations on dates beginning in 1971.
A medical expert gave evidence during his trial that there was no medical basis for the behaviour described by the seven men.
Judge Martin Nolan sentenced the doctor to four years in prison on one of the counts of indecent assault. He sentenced him to 18 months on all other counts and ordered that each sentence run concurrently.
Rejecting all grounds of appeal today Justice Isobel Kennedy, sitting with Justice John Edwards and Justice Una Ní Raifeartaigh, said there was “no substance” to the complaint regarding the judge’s use of the word “compelling” in his charge to the jury.
Justice Kennedy said that when read in context, the judge was telling the jury that if the complainants had made their statements independently, without colluding with one another, that would make the number of complaints compelling.
She added: “We see nothing wrong in his having said that.”
In total the court rejected 17 grounds of appeal including a suggestion that the trial judge should have ended the trial when witnesses gave evidence that the accused had been struck off the medical register, that a civil action had been settled and that there had been an earlier criminal trial.

Hugh Hartnett SC for the doctor said this evidence had prejudiced his client and that the effect was magnified when there are multiple complainants.
Justice Kennedy disagreed, saying that withdrawing a trial from a jury is a last resort and the evidence heard did not justify a discharge of the jury.
Following the trial and conviction, Judge Nolan said that the appropriate headline sentence in the absence of mitigation was one of seven years, describing the offending as a “serious pattern of misbehaviour”.
He said that the mitigating factors included his age and that there was a possibility of him dying while imprisoned.","The doctor was jailed for four years in February of last year.",19,0,0,28619,"Nov 17th 2020, 2:07 PM"

“We hope that we will be able to resolve the matter satisfactorily.  It makes no sense that to stop outdoor trading while allowing shops to trade indoors,” said Costello, a member of the Henry Street Traders Committee.

Six people died in Ireland in incidents involving scrambler or quad bikes between 2014 and 2019, with three of those who died under the age of 18. 
Sinn Féin is tabling a motion this evening seeking to have the Dáil acknowledge that there is an issue and that new laws are required. 
The motion seeks support for the introduction of laws that would effectively allow gardaí to seize and keep the vehicles if they were being driven in a dangerous manner in a public place. 
The motion also calls for gardaí to be given the necessary resources and training to chase and apprehend people using scramblers unlawfully. 
Speaking this morning, Sinn Féin’s Paul Donnelly TD said that if a scrambler is currently seized by gardaí the individual can then retrieve the vehicle at a later date and that “this is something we need to end”. 
The issue of scrambler bikes has been raised numerous times in recent, with Tánaiste Leo Varadkar saying last year that a cross-agency report recommended that “targeted measures” such as better education for young people about the use of the bikes should be rolled out, rather than any new legislation.
A previous Sinn Féin bill also sought to give gardaí similar powers that the new motion is proposing.

Asked today about why legislation in this area has not been supported, Donnelly said today that there had been concerns it could have unintended consequences but he feels these are now addressed with the new proposal. 
“There was an issue in relation to the Road Traffic Act and how it would impact if we include public spaces and parks, but there is a section which we have put forward in the bill under the Public Order Act, which already defines parks and open spaces in the piece of legislation which we cover that part of the Road Traffic Act as well.

In an interview with South East Radio today, Fitzgerald announced he is staying on for 2021.

When the pointed criticism directed his way from Loughnane’s Daily Star column was raised, Fitzgerald took aim at his former manager.
“I asked him to present the medals to the (Clare) team in 2013, he actually said to them that night he didn’t rate them a good team until they won a second one, which I thought was a very nasty thing to say to them.”
He added: “He actually couldn’t read a game. If you look at any of his articles, he can’t read the game, he doesn’t see what is going on.”
“But listen, he has to do what he has to do and if he is making a few quid from it, grand. But let’s just say, he wouldn’t be really up with what’s happening in the GAA world, in my view.”

Source: Glenveagh Properties
DUBLIN CITY COUNCIL last night rejected plans to build 853 new homes on a redeveloped Council-owned site. 
The development at Oscar Traynor Road in Santry was set to be a public-private partnership with developer Glenveagh.
Under the scheme, 50% of the homes would be private, 30% social and 20% affordable-purchase. 
The development formed part of the Council’s Housing Land Initiative – drawn up in 2015 – which aims to work alongside developers to build a mix of social, affordable and private housing on large council-owned sites. 
O’Devaney Gardens and St Michael’s Estate also form part of the scheme. Councillors agreed to redevelop these council-owned lands in January 2017. 
St Michael’s Estate in Inchicore has been designated for Dublin City’s first cost-rental project for low and middle-income workers. 
Councillors last year ratified a last-minute deal with Bartra to redevelop O’Devaney Gardens.
Following that deal, the focus turned to the Oscar Traynor lands, a development on a 17-hectare site at the junction of the Port Tunnel and Oscar Traynor Road. 
Many Councillors weren’t satisfied with the deal struck at O’Devaney and wanted to ensure that a similarly-sized tranche of public land wasn’t handed over to another developer. 
The plans at Oscar Traynor Road included 428 homes which would be sold privately by Glenveagh. A total of 253 would be bought by Dublin City Council for social housing and 172 homes would be sold to low and middle-income workers who qualify for the Government’s upcoming affordable purchase scheme. 
The two-bedroom affordable purchase homes would be priced between €250,000 to €300,000.
Councillors last month raised a number of concerns regarding the deal with Glenveagh. 
Similar to the arguments made about O’Devaney Gardens last year, they said that the affordable purchase homes at Oscar Traynor Road wouldn’t be affordable to couples on lower and middle incomes. 
Under the scheme, developer Glenveagh was due to pay the Council €14 million for the land and redevelop it. The Council would then pay Glenveagh to build the social housing units on the site. 
Council officials argued that the developer could deliver a standard of design and amenity that the Council couldn’t. 
#OPEN JOURNALISM No news is bad news Support The Journal Your contributions will help us continue to deliver the stories that are important to you
SUPPORT US NOW
Councillors also raised concerns that the Council would be tied to the price it would pay for the social housing units until 2024, with no guarantee the scheme wouldn’t be delayed due to Covid-19, and that it would be left up to the developer how they would dispose of the new homes, which some Councillors said could include selling them in bulk to a private investment trust. 
Sinn Féin last week issued a circular to all parties and council management calling for the Oscar Traynor lands to be financed in the same way as the St Michael’s development. 
The party called for central government and European Investment Bank funds to develop public housing at the Oscar Traynor site in order to deliver a mix of social rental and cost rental as well as affordable purchase homes. 
The Council’s Head of Housing Brendan Kenny last night said the homes at Oscar Traynor Road were “badly needed” and said that Glenveagh had indicated a willingness to sell 50% or more of the private homes back to the Council for a cost-rental scheme. 
Kenny said it could be eight years before another opportunity to redevelop the lands arose again and said the Council’s credibility with developers would be “severely dented” if Councillors rejected the plan. 
In the end, Councillors from Labour, the Green Party, Social Democrats, Sinn Féin and independents weren’t convinced and said they couldn’t back it. 
Instead, they called on the Council to redevelop the site itself and called for an emergency meeting with Housing Minister Darragh O’Brien to explore options for how to deliver public housing at the site. 
Councillors voted overwhelmingly – 48 to 14 – to reject the plan with Glenveagh. ","The development at Oscar Traynor Road in Santry was set to be a public-private partnership with developer Glenveagh.",14,0,2,26951,"Nov 17th 2020, 12:21 PM"

The video conferencing platform has become a key communication tool for millions of people working and studying from home during the coronavirus pandemic.
However, it has come under scrutiny over its security features and flaws within the app, including incidents which have become known as Zoombombings, where strangers force their way onto the video calls of others, often disrupting them by displaying harmful and explicit images and video.
In an effort to cut out these incidents, the platform has announced it is introducing two new features to help quickly remove and report any unwanted participants.
A new Suspend Participant Activities tool enables meeting hosts to temporarily pause a meeting and remove a disruptive party within it, as well as report them to Zoom, before restarting the meeting.
All meeting participants, not just hosts, can now also report anyone being disruptive or abusive using a new option found by clicking on the green security badge in the top left corner of the meeting screen.
In addition, the app has introduced a feature which scans public social media posts and websites for publicly shared Zoom meeting links, warning an account owner if their meetings are likely to be affected by Zoombombings.
Publicly shared meeting links have been identified as one of the main reasons Zoombombings occur, with the video app urging users not to share such details in public forums.

The complainant said that the image, when taken alongside the text of the advertisement, clearly intended to convey that Jerusalem’s Old City was part of Israel and not an “occupied and illegally colonised area.”
The advertisement appeared in an article on the radio station’s website highlighting a prize that was available via an on-air competition on the station’s breakfast show during the week of the 18 to 22 November 2019.
The on-air promotion referred to in the article offered the prize of return flights from Dublin to Tel Aviv with El Al Airlines.
“Fly to Israel for as little as €319, from May 2020. Enjoy a sunset on Tel Aviv beach, tour the historic city of Jerusalem or float in the dead sea,” the advert read. 
“Enjoy a sunset on Tel Aviv beach, tour the historic city of Jerusalem or float in the dead sea, ” it read under a collection of pictures, which included the Armenian Walls in the Old City Jerusalem. 
The complainant said that the old city was universally recognised an “occupied and illegally colonised area” in International Law, by the UN Security Council, by the UN General Assembly, by the European Union, by the Irish Government, and by all major human rights organisations.
In response to the complaint, Classic Hits said the advert highlighted a number of activities that a prize winner could potentially engage in whilst on their trip to the region, and that the article had made no reference to the nationality of the activities/attractions featured. 
The station argued that Irish travellers seeking holiday options in the region would find a similar approach taken by many travel company operated websites. It said that these travel sites and articles did not deal with the geopolitical issues of the destinations highlighted.
It added that the article had been honest and truthful in relation to the breakfast show, the prize on offer and the details of the prize.
The ASAI complaint’s committee noted that it had not been the station’s intention to imply that any area mentioned in their advertising was in a particular jurisdiction, but given the invitation to “journey to Israel”, without clarification, the implication was that the featured destinations were all in Israel.
“The advertisement had included the statement “Begin your exciting journey to Israel …” and featured a number of destinations, including Jerusalem and its Old City Walls. It had not stated that the destinations were all in Israel. 
“As the Old City was not recognised by the international community as forming part of Israel, the Committee considered that the reference to “begin your exciting journey to Israel” was likely to mislead and was in breach of Sections 4.1 and 4.4 of the Code,” the ASAI concluded. 
As the competition was closed, no further action was required in this case. 
Pretty Little Thing 
Meanwhile, the ASAI upheld a separate complaint about an undisclosed commercial relationship between an influencer and clothing brand Pretty Little Thing.
The complainant felt Emma Kehoe’s Instagram post for the brand was misleading as it was not identified as an advertisement. 
In response to the complaint, Kehoe confirmed that she had received payment for the post in question and apologised for the oversight.
She said that she had been instructed by the brand to include the Instagram ‘paid partnership’ feature in her post and that she had requested the brand set up this feature for her at the time of the agreement. 
She said that, as the inclusion of ‘#sp’ or similar had not been specifically instructed by the brand, she neglected to include such identifiers in the post. 
#OPEN JOURNALISM No news is bad news Support The Journal Your contributions will help us continue to deliver the stories that are important to you

Pretty Little Thing said the agreement which was in place with Kehoe required her to properly identify any social media advertisements on Instagram by way of including the Instagram ‘paid partnerships’ feature. 
It added that she could include ‘#ad’ in the post and asked her to amend the post in question.
The Complaints Committee acknowledged that the post had been amended and welcomed Kehoe’s commitment to ensure transparency in future advertising. 
As the post should have been marked or hashtagged correctly to indicate the existence of a commercial relationship, the committee considered that the post was in breach of Code sections 4.1, 4.4, 3.31 and 3.32.
No further action was required in relation to the advertising complained about, as the post was amended.
Commenting on the ASAI’s latest complaint’s bulletin, which related to the internet and social media, chief executive Orla Twomey said: 
“The latest complaints bulletin from the ASAI illustrates our ability to handle complaints across online platforms, in particular social media, and demonstrates how we ensure that ads in Ireland stick to the advertising rules.
“The ASAI is committed to protecting society in relation to advertising across all mediums.

He took what was intended to be a two-year sabbatical, and never went back.

“It came at a time when I felt I needed a break. I never in my life wanted to be a novelist or write books, never mind musicals. But it just kind of happened. Pretty much everything that’s happened to me professionally since I left journalism has been a complete accident.” 
That’s not to say his lessons from sportswriting went totally forgotten. 
“I was quite young at the time, I was around 18, and had been asked to cover a schools rugby game for the Indo. I didn’t know much about it, it was new to me. I certainly didn’t know why it was taken so seriously. 
“I remember my first match was Skerries against Blackrock, I think, and seeing 1500 people at this schools’ game. I was asked for 10 paragraphs, which was across six columns of a broadsheet daily newspaper. At that stage in my career it was definitely the biggest story I was ever asked to write, in terms of the word count. I couldn’t understand why it was taken so seriously. But I remember being confused by the mass of double-barrelled names on both sides. There were names everywhere! There may have been a few Roman numerals in there too. 
“At one point I must have lost my concentration, but I gave a try to the wrong kid. I was then called in by the Indo, and was told, ‘We’ve had a solicitor’s letter about your match report.’

“I was thinking, ‘How could I libel someone in a match report? 
“He [the sports editor] said, ‘You gave the try to the wrong kid.’ 
“‘Right…is that serious?’ 
“‘He said to me, ‘You have to remember with these kids. This kid was born, and his Dad brings a rugby ball to the maternity hospital and puts it in the basket with him. The kid is brought home and by the time the kid can stand up, the Dad is throwing a rugby ball at him. The kid then plays junior rugby with his pals in the park, and then he goes to secondary school and the plan is to make the Junior Cup team. He makes the Junior Cup team. 
“‘Then he’s told the most important thing in his entire life is to make the Senior Cup team. And he makes the Senior Cup team. And in his very first match, he scores a try. And you get his fucking name wrong.’ 
“I could see it as quite a reasonable thing to be upset when he explained it to me like that! 
“The solicitor’s letter demanded a retraction, a correction and an apology. I was just told to be grateful they weren’t looking for damages. 
“But that whole thing about the Dad who is ready to defend his sporting son’s honour with a solicitor’s letter is essentially the dynamic Ross has with Charles O’Carroll Kelly, so I stole that. It wasn’t a wasted lesson on me.”

Investigators were also raiding 18 properties in Berlin, including 10 apartments as well as garages and vehicles, police and prosecutors said in a statement.
“The measures today are focused on the search for the stolen art treasures and possible evidence, such as data storage media, clothing and tools,” they said.
In what local media have described as the biggest art heist in modern history, the robbers had launched their brazen raid on Green Vault museum in Dresden’s Royal Palace on 25 November 2019.
Having initiated a partial power cut and broken in through a window, they snatched priceless 18th-century jewellery from the collection of the Saxon ruler August the Strong.
Items stolen included a sword whose hilt is encrusted with nine large and 770 smaller diamonds, and a shoulderpiece which contains the famous 49-carat Dresden white diamond, Dresden’s Royal Palace had said.
Dramatic CCTV footage released at that time showed one of the robbers breaking into a display case with an axe.
Police hunting for the suspects had launched several appeals, offering up to half a million euros in reward for information leading to their arrests.
Yesterday, around 1,600 officers were deployed in the raids and arrests, with special reinforcements called in from across the country to help.
Police did not identify the three arrested, but said they are German citizens.
All three are accused of “serious gang robbery and two counts of arson,” said Dresden prosecutors.
100-kg gold coin
Germany has been hit by several high-profile heists, with banks and museums frequent targets.
A Berlin court sentenced three men to multi-year jail sentences in February for the theft of a 100-kilogram gold coin from one of the German capital’s museums.

The Big Maple Leaf, one of five minted in 2007, is considered the world’s second-largest gold coin after the one-tonne Australian Kangaroo issued in 2012.
Robbers also hit a German customs office early November, making off with €6.5 million in cash.

610,244,"Opinion: We at Irish universities owe it to our students to address our imperial legacies",https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/university-and-imperialism-5269344-Nov2020/,"THE #RHODESMUSTFALL CAMPAIGN began in the University of Cape Town in 2015, worked its way through several South African Universities, before rolling to a standstill in Oxford in 2016.
It is easy to see why the statue of British imperialist Rhodes fell in Cape Town, and easier still to see why he didn’t in Britain. In a 2014 poll, 59% of Britons thought that the British Empire was something to be proud of, and 49% thought that those countries colonised by Britain had gained more from it than they had lost.
Many of us here in Ireland are far from proud to be associated with that same empire and yet our links to it are complex and multi-layered, and nowhere more so than in our universities.
The statue question
The summer of 2020 has seen a renewed focus on the legacies of empire in British Universities. In June 2020 Oriel College in Oxford – a sister college of Trinity College Dublin – voted to remove its statue of Cecil Rhodes only for the University Vice-Chancellor (and Waterford-native) Professor Louise Richardson, to declare that ‘hiding your history is not the route to enlightenment.’
The result of the standoff is that the University has commissioned a report on the issue that will be completed in early in 2021. Until then, at least, Rhodes will stand. 
The oldest universities are naturally most exposed on this issue. Glasgow and Cambridge have both commissioned exemplary reports and Glasgow has even committed to paying reparations following the outstanding activism of report author and historian Dr Stephen Mullan.
The statue of Colston is already in the water in Bristol, and it seems that Rhodes is on his way to a similar fate.
But what have Irish universities done? What should they do? In Ireland, the closest we have come to a Rhodes-style controversy was a relatively polite conversation about the removal of a pair of mass-produced statues outside the Shelbourne Hotel. It seems somehow meagre, and beside the point. 
Where does Trinity stand?
Here at Trinity College Dublin, we have started a productive conversation among staff and students about how to best confront our own historic ties to imperialism. That conversation has begun, perhaps obviously, with the figureheads that might attract the attention of anti-imperial protest.
In the case of Trinity, that person is likeliest to be Bishop of Cloyne, George Berkeley – a stellar philosopher and one of the most prominent scholars ever produced by the University.
We named our signature brutalist 1960s library after Berkeley, who also gives his name to the citadel of liberal west coast thought in San Francisco, the University of California, Berkeley.
But he was also a slave-owner, who bought and later sold four lives. He renamed these enslaved people Philip, Anthony, Agnes, and Edward, and later sold them, donating the profits to Yale.
Just as troubling, Berkeley adopted a philosophical position arguing that baptism was compatible with continued slavery, helping to deny many victims a potential route out of enslavement and perhaps convincing others of the validity of his position.
Trinity College Dublin prefers, generally, to speak about more robustly anti-imperial campaigners, politicians, and statesmen, and happily, there are many such figures. This is the history we want to hear, and to advance it the College often turns to perhaps the most prominent Trinity figure of the late eighteenth century, Edmund Burke.
Burke’s consistent position was anti-slavery, and he was an important public voice against the unfettered and corrupt expansion of empire at the margins, though he was somewhat selective about which evils he exposed.
Trinity voices were also prominent in the anti-Apartheid movement in the second half of the twentieth century, co-founded by the exiled Kader Asmal, from the Department of Law. 
It is easy for us to try and balance each Berkeley with a Burke, and to point to abolitionists and anti-apartheid activists. But that is a sort of sophistry. Trinity has produced many more ideas and graduates in the service of empire than it has people who have publicly criticised it. 
Deconstructing the past
A 12 June article in the Irish Times pointed to grants made by the Irish parliament to Trinity in the 17th century, noting that this money was imperial in origin in that it was based on revenues from the tobacco trade. This seems to me a somewhat secondary or even tertiary example to have chosen.
Trinity has numerous more direct associations with empire. It was, of course, a beneficiary of the colonisation of Ireland, amassing endowments, parliamentary grants and more than 180,000 acres of land confiscated from Irish people.

The curriculum of the College was progressively geared towards the needs of empire from the eighteenth century onwards, with professors of Sanskrit and other exotic languages helping to teach and acculturate future colonial graduates of all Irish backgrounds. 
The College collections and archives tell the same story. By the late 19th century, Trinity was recognisably an imperial university like Glasgow or Oxford. Its zoological, botanical, and anatomical holdings were amassed by roving Victorian academics whose collecting habits at the margins of empire (and morality) have bequeathed to future generations of Trinity students a large repository of animal and human remains.
Research projects in phrenology, anthropometrics, and other proto-eugenic practices were carried out enthusiastically at Trinity.
Our library contains Syriac, Sumeriac, Ethiopic, and Persian materials. Trinity’s legacies are therefore an outcome of a time when Irish people were deeply invested in the imperial project,  in much the same way that the ethnographic collections were built in the National Museum of Ireland or the holdings of the Royal Irish Academy. 
It is not difficult to discern a coyness about empire in Irish institutions like Trinity, or the former Queens Colleges at Cork and Galway, or indeed University College Dublin, each of which has produced generations of imperial graduates from all religious backgrounds. Irish universities have some work to do in confronting their imperial legacies and are some way behind global movements for doing so.
This is an important task, not just for the sake of transparency but because we must respond to the questions we are hearing from our students, who are increasingly animated by controversies such as #RhodesMustFall and the energy generated by Black Lives Matter.
The demographics of our student intake has altered significantly in the past decade and our classrooms now include many more students of dual, multi or biracial heritage. These students have probing questions about the links between Irish institutions and empire, and we have a responsibility to answer these questions.

611,189,"Hurricane Iota batters Nicaragua coast just 12 days after destructive Hurricane Eta",https://www.thejournal.ie/huricane-iota-nicaragua-5269362-Nov2020/,"THE FRONT EDGE of powerful Hurricane Iota has battered Nicaragua’s Caribbean coast, threatening catastrophic damage to the same part of Central America already hit by equally strong Hurricane Eta less than two weeks ago.
Iota had intensified into an extremely dangerous Category 5 storm early yesterday, but the US National Hurricane Centre said it weakened slightly last night night to Category 4, with maximum sustained winds of 155mph.
It was centred about 30 miles south of the Nicaraguan city of Puerto Cabezas, also known as Bilwi, and moving westward at 9mph.
Iota was hitting the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Honduras with torrential rains and strong winds while the western edge of the storm began battering the Nicaraguan coast.
Authorities warned that Iota would probably come ashore over areas where Eta’s torrential rains saturated the soil, leaving it prone to new landslides and floods, and that the storm surge could reach 15 to 20 feet above normal tides.
In Bilwi, business owner Adan Artola Schultz braced himself in the doorway of his house as strong gusts of wind and rain drover water in torrents down the street.
He watched in amazement as wind ripped away the metal roof structure from a substantial two-story home and blew it away like paper.
“It is like bullets,” he said of the sound of metal structures banging and buckling in the wind.
“This is double destruction,” he added, referring to the damages wrought by Eta just 12 days earlier.
Cairo Jarquin, Nicaragua emergency response project manager for Catholic Relief Services, had just visited Bilwi and smaller coastal communities on Friday.
In Wawa Bar, Jarquin said he found “total destruction” from Eta. People had been working furiously to put roofs back over their families’ heads, but now Iota threatened to take what was left.
“The little that remained standing could be razed,” he Jarquin said. There were other communities farther inland that he was not even able to reach due to the condition of roads.
Evacuations were conducted from low-lying areas in Nicaragua and Honduras near their shared border through the weekend.
Nicaraguan Vice President Rosario Murillo, who is also the first lady, said that the government had done everything necessary to protect lives, including the evacuation of thousands.
She added that Taiwan had donated 800 tons of rice to help those affected by the storms.
Iota is the record 30th named storm of this year’s extraordinarily busy Atlantic hurricane season.
It is also the ninth storm to rapidly intensify this season, a dangerous phenomenon that is happening increasingly more often.
Such activity has focused attention on climate change, which scientists say is causing wetter, stronger and more destructive storms.
Iota is stronger, based on central pressure, than 2005′s Hurricane Katrina and is the first storm with a Greek alphabet name to hit Category 5, Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach said.
It also sets the record for the latest Category 5 hurricane on record, beating the record set by the 8 November 1932 Cuba Hurricane.

Eta had hit Nicaragua as a Category 4 hurricane, killing more than 130 people as torrential rains caused flash floods and mudslides in parts of Central America and Mexico.
Then it meandered across Cuba, the Florida Keys and around the Gulf of Mexico before slogging ashore again near Cedar Key, Florida, and dashing across Florida and the Carolinas.
Iota was forecast to drop 10 to 20 inches of rain in northern Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and southern Belize, with as much as 30 inches in isolated spots.
Costa Rica and Panama could also experience heavy rain and possible flooding, the hurricane centre said.
Over the past couple of decades, meteorologists have been more worried about storms like Iota that power up much faster than normal.
They created an official threshold for this rapid intensification — a storm gaining 35mph in wind speed in just 24 hours. Iota doubled it.
Earlier this year, Hannah, Laura, Sally, Teddy, Gamma, Delta, Zeta and Iota all rapidly intensified. Laura and Delta tied or set records for rapid intensification.

During a meeting at the Oval Office last Thursday, the outgoing Republican leader asked several top aides, including Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Mark Milley, “whether he had options to take action against Iran’s main nuclear site in the coming weeks,” the newspaper said. 
The senior officials “dissuaded the president from moving ahead with a military strike,” warning him that such an attack could escalate into a broader conflict in the last weeks of his presidency, the Times wrote.
Trump reportedly asked the question after a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said that Iran was continuing to stockpile uranium. 
According to the Times, the most likely target of such a strike would have been Natanz, where the IAEA reported that Tehran’s “uranium stockpile was now 12 times larger than permitted under the nuclear accord that Mr Trump abandoned in 2018,” three years after it was signed in a bid to curb Iran’s nuclear capabilities. 
Iran has long been Trump’s bugbear, and he first reintroduced sanctions and then tightened them even further after scrapping the nuclear accord.

The preliminary result comes ahead of a clinical trial into whether using over-the-counter mouthwash has the potential to reduce the levels of Covid-19 in a patient’s saliva.
The Cardiff University report said that mouthwashes containing at least 0.07% cetypyridinium chloride (CPC) showed “promising signs” of being able to combat the virus.
The report – The Virucidal Efficacy of Oral Rinse Components Against SARS-CoV-2 In Vitro – is yet to be peer reviewed but supports another study published last week that found CPC-based mouthwashes are effective in reducing Covid’s viral load.
The latest test was carried out by scientists at the university’s laboratory and mimicked the conditions of a person’s naso/oropharynx passage using mouthwash brands including Dentyl.
A clinical trial will next examine how effective mouthwash is in reducing the viral load in the saliva of Covid-19 patients at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, with its results due to be published in the first part of 2021.
Dentyl is the only UK mouthwash brand to take part in the 12-week clinical trial, which is led by Professor David Thomas from Cardiff University and titled: “The measurement of mouthwash anti-viral activity against Covid-19”.
Dr Thomas told the PA news agency: “Whilst these mouthwashes very effectively eradicate the virus in the laboratory, we need to see if they work in patients and this is the point of our ongoing clinical study.
“It is important to point out the study won’t give us any direct evidence on viral transmission between patients, that would require a different type of study on a much larger scale.
“The ongoing clinical study will, however, show us how long any effects last, following a single administration of the mouthwash in patients with Covid-19.”

He added: “Although this in-vitro study is very encouraging and is a positive step, more clinical research is now clearly needed.
“We need to understand if the effect of over-the-counter mouthwashes on the Covid-19 virus achieved in the laboratory can be reproduced in patients, and we look forward to completing our clinical trial in early 2021.”
Dr Nick Claydon, a specialist periodontologist, said he believed the research was “very valuable”.
He said: “If these positive results are reflected in Cardiff University’s clinical trial, CPC-based mouthwashes such as Dentyl used in the in-vitro study could become an important addition to people’s routine, together with hand washing, physical distancing and wearing masks, both now and in the future.”","Professor David Thomas said although the study is very encouraging, more clinical research is now needed.",53,0,7,64531,"Nov 17th 2020, 7:36 AM"

The Dragon capsule pulled up and docked early this morning, following a 27-hour, completely automated flight from NASA’s Kennedy Space Centre.
“Oh, what a good voice to hear,” space station astronaut Kate Rubins called out when the Dragon’s commander, Mike Hopkins, first made radio contact. The linkup occurred 262 miles above Idaho.
This is the second astronaut mission for SpaceX. But it is the first time Elon Musk’s company delivered a crew for a full half-year station stay.
The two-pilot test flight earlier this year lasted two months.
The three Americans and one Japanese astronaut will remain at the orbiting lab until their replacements arrive on another Dragon in April.
And so it will go, with SpaceX — and eventually Boeing — transporting astronauts to and from the station for NASA.
Hopkins and his crew — Victor Glover, Shannon Walker and Japan’s Soichi Noguchi — join two Russians and one American who flew to the space station last month from Kazakhstan.
The four named their capsule Resilience to provide hope and inspiration during an especially difficult year for the whole world.

A report from the government’s arts and culture recovery taskforce, which was presented to Cabinet by Minister for Arts Catherine Martin today, calls for a basic income scheme to be introduced for the sector.
Speaking to reporters this afternoon, the minister said her Cabinet colleagues were very supportive of the measures contained in the report, and she believe they will engage positively on the issues.
The minister said engagement with the oversight committee will happen quickly, stating there is an urgency in supporting those working in the arts and entertainment business, who have in dire circumstances in the pandemic.
Around 55,000 workers could benefit from the new scheme which will give a tax-free payment to workers and performers in the arts and entertainment business to meet essential living costs.
The payment could be between €200 and €276 per week and will be tax-free.
Anything recipients earn above that will be taxed as normal.
Welcoming the report today, Minister Catherine Martin said the report sheds light on a “dire crisis that the sector now faces – incomes have disappeared; performers have no audiences; cultural spaces, concert halls and galleries remain empty and the lights have been turned off for the live events sector”.
The idea for a basic income is similar to a recommendation in the programme for government about rolling out a universal basic income scheme.
Clare Duignan, the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce chairperson, said the aim of the group was to help those working in the sector survive. 
“Things are absolutely desperate for people,” she said, adding that the taskforce believes this sector is ready and suitable for the pilot project for income support.
Irish Equity, a section of Siptu, has welcomed the proposal to introduce a basic income scheme for workers.
Karan O Loughlin of Irish Equity said the arts is a largely low pay sector, particularly so in the live performance area.
She encourages the government to act quickly on the recommendations that are so badly needed for the survival and development of the sector.

In addition to the basic support scheme, the report also seeks to establish a new VAT compensation scheme for artists and for freelance arts, live entertainment and events workers and companies.
It also calls for business supports grant scheme for SME’s in the events industry that are excluded from the COVID-19 restrictions support scheme (CRSS).
A capital improvement programme, including targeted resources for local authorities to adapt, equip or improve public spaces so that cultural events and activities can take place outside, is also called for.
The National Campaign for the Arts said in a recent report that the basic income idea had gained ground over the past months.

And from the outside, we’re no closer to a post-Brexit trade deal. 
The virtual European Council meeting on Thursday of this week is seen as the latest deadline for an outcome to the trade talks – but many take the view that there is too much work left to have it all agreed in a neat package by the end of the week. 
Talks have been crawling forward since the summer, and though there has been some vague talk from the UK side of “progress in a positive direction in recent days”, not all that much has changed in the last few months. 
British chief negotiator David Frost still says the deal must respect “the sovereignty of the UK”, while the EU’s Michel Barnier is calling for one that respects the EU’s autonomy and protects its Single Market and Customs Union.
Source: David Frost/Twitter
The three main stumbling blocks that have ground talks to a halt have been:
Level-playing field provisions: This is about the EU and UK agreeing the same set of rules on things like workplace standards and workers rights; environmental standards; and rules on State aid (so EU or UK firms don’t get an unfair advantage).
Governance: If the UK or EU have been accused of breaking the rules of any trade agreement they might reach, who will decide whether this accusation is fair, and what would the punishment for breaching rules of the agreement be? The UK does not want this to be the European Court of Justice.
Fisheries: There is a row over how many EU fishing boats the UK will allow into its waters, and how many fish it will allow them to catch. The UK wants to ‘take back control of its waters’, but the EU argues that European boats have fished in British waters since long before it joined the European Union. You can read Irish fishermen’s concerns about the fisheries deal here.
The reason they cannot agree on these issues comes down to the same issue, mentioned above: the UK’s pursuit of sovereignty, versus the EU’s attempt to protect its Single Market and Customs Union, versus concerns for Northern Ireland.
Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Simon Coveney said at the weekend that this was “move week”, where some action needed to be taken, if progress were to be made at all.
Fine Gael TD Neale Richmond said that there are still “large gaps” between the two sides on the level-playing field and fisheries.
“The UK isn’t happy with the level of access that the EU wants, but 70% of the value of its catch and 50% of its quantity is sold into the Single Market,” he told TheJournal.ie.
Richmond said that one area where progress has been made is the legal drafting that has been done. 
There’s a gap there to say ‘this is where fisheries and the level-playing field goes’, but 600 pages of what has been agreed has been drafted into legal text. The final 10% requires a political decision, and if we don’t have those, we won’t have a deal. 
Where are talks at now?

The UK left the EU on 31 January of this year. Its MEPs left the European Parliament, the UK has no Commissioner in the European Commission, and it isn’t a part of, for example, the EU’s initiative to buy Covid-19 vaccine doses and distribute them. 
The UK is still in the Customs Union and Single Market, meaning citizens and businesses are still availing of the four freedoms of the European Union (movement, capital, goods and services).
This period from 31 January-31 December 2020 is known as the transition period.
During this time, the EU and UK were to strike a trade deal that would replace the UK’s membership of the Single Market and Customs Union, and importantly, figure out how trade would work for Northern Ireland without the need for a hard border on the island of Ireland.

Neale Richmond: When Boris refers to an 'Australia-style' deal with the EU, he's talking through his hat
The transition period would also give businesses time to prepare themselves for whatever changes would come down the track, it was planned. 
When asked about the government’s campaign to make people aware of those Brexit changes, Richmond said the message was a difficult sell at this stage. 
How many times can you ask people to go back to the well to prepare to Brexit, while they have to deal with [the Covid-19 pandemic], which is really really tough? 
The Leavers have left
After it emerged that Dominic Cummings – credited with being the architect behind the Brexit vote in the 2016 referendum – and his Brexit colleague Lee Cain would be leaving No 10 Downing Street, many political commentators are claiming that this paves the way for Boris Johnson to soften his negotiation stance and agree a trade deal with the EU.
This cohort of commentators includes Nigel Farage. 
“The Leavers are leaving Downing Street,” the arch Brexiteer and former leader of both UKIP and the Brexit Party told talkRADIO. 
After saying that it was “very likely” that there would be a “pro-Brussels, pro-Dublin” president of the United States (referring to Joe Biden’s election win), Farage said: “I had this terrible sinking feeling over the weekend that Boris is very close to selling out on Brexit.”
There had been some suggestions that if Donald Trump had been reelected, Johnson would continue a hard line on post-Brexit trade talks. But without the man who referred to him as “Britain Trump” in office, Johnson would be less inclined to be so brave.
Though US president-elect Joe Biden may not be as close to the EU as some may hope, he and the Democrats have voiced support for the Good Friday Agreement; Taoiseach Micheál Martin even said that he mentioned it in their first phone call since the election.
Richmond says that Cummings and Cain are “less important” to Brexit talks than people may think, as they were “internal operators”.
99% of the EU don’t have a clue who Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain were. Now, it’s not good timing that there is this internal chaos [in 10 Downing Street]. If Johnson wants the deal, it’s there. What he has to decide is whether he can appease the ultras in his party.

The Internal Market Bill
Then there’s the tricky Internal Market Bill. 
The UK has proposed a Bill that would give a British minister control to give State aid to Northern Ireland businesses without consulting the EU, as well as decide what goods travelling from GB to NI would need custom declaration forms.
This is contrary to the Withdrawal Agreement that was struck between the EU and UK, and ratified by Westminster in January of this year.
As it stands, the UK House of Lords have voted to remove two clauses from the Bill that relate to Northern Ireland. 
Coveney told Sky News at the weekend:
“Even if we do get a new trade deal negotiated by both sides, if the British Government is determined to continue with their Internal Market Bill – to reintroduce parts of that Bill that were removed by the House of Lords this week – then, I think this is a deal that won’t be ratified by the EU.
Because there is no way the EU will agree to ratify a new agreement if the British Government is breaking the existing agreement that is not even 12 months old, and breaking international law by doing that.","It’s another crunch week on the Brexit front – so what are the sticking points?",0,0,0,7902,"Nov 17th 2020, 6:00 AM"

The incoming president expressed frustration about Trump’s refusal so far to co-operate on the White House transition process.
He warned that US deaths from Covid-19 could increase if issues like distributing vaccines to Americans as quickly as possible were hampered by the transition.
“If we have to wait until [inauguration day] 20 January to start that planning, it puts us behind for a month, a month and a half,” he said.
“And so it’s important that there be coordination now — now, or as rapidly as we can get that done.”
Nearly two weeks after the presidential election, Trump has insisted that he won and has made unsubstantiated claims of mass fraud even as Biden had unassailable leads in key states and a major edge in the popular vote.
While Biden is set to take over on 20 January regardless of whether Trump admits defeat, the General Services Administration – the usually low-profile agency that manages the federal bureaucracy – has refused to certify Biden as the winner.
The move has resulted in Biden being denied classified briefings and resources for the transition.

A murder investigation was launched last year after the pensioner’s body was discovered inside his home in Birch Drive, Bangor, Co Down on 19 November last year.
He suffered skull and facial fractures in the attack, his body showed no sign of defensive injuries and he was “likely to have been utterly defenceless in the face of the violence he faced”, the PSNI said at the time.
There was no sign of forced entry to his house and police said that they did not believe his death was caused by a paramilitary-style attack or that it was sexually motivated.
One theory was that Kerr was attacked because he disturbed intruders in his home or that he was murdered because of a personal vendetta.
PSNI believe that he was murdered sometime between 2pm on Sunday 17 November – when he was last seen – and the morning of  Monday 18 November, when he failed to leave the house according to his normal routine.
Detective Chief Inspector Michelle Shaw described him as “a defenceless older man” who was subjected to a vicious and cruel attack.
Police still believe that answers to the murder lie within the community, and have appealed to the public for help.

“Mike’s killers would have had bloodstained clothes and you may have noticed someone you know acting strangely,” Shaw said.
“I am appealing to the public to help us remove whoever murdered Mike from their community by bringing any information they have to either the police or to Crimestoppers.
“If anyone has any information, no matter how insignificant it may seem, detectives can be contacted at the Major Investigation team.”

THE UK HAS demanded “realism” from the European Union as crunch talks on a post-Brexit trade deal resumed in Brussels today.
The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the bloc remains “determined” and “patient” but stressed the need for future competition between the 27 member states and the UK to be fair.
On the UK side, Downing Street said time is “very short” to reach a deal which could be implemented when transition arrangements expire at the end of the year.
Talks on a post-Brexit trading relationship between the UK and European Union continue this week as the clock continues to tick until the end of the transition period.
UK chief negotiator David Frost is in Brussels for another round of negotiations ahead of a European Council video summit on Thursday which has been touted as a deadline for a draft deal.
The UK formally left the European Union in January, but will continue to follow the bloc’s regulations until the end of the year — just over six weeks away.
If no agreement is in place at the end of December, goods travelling between the two areas will be subject to tariffs set out by the World Trade Organisation.
The two sides – led by Barnier and Frost – are now working on draft legal texts, but key parts of the documents have not been agreed.
The issues which are still to be ironed out are thought to include the ongoing row over fishing rights, how any deal between the two parties would be governed, and the “level playing field” measures aimed at preventing unfair competition on issues including state subsidies.
Despite some signs of progress – not least the fact that talks are continuing – it is clear that major concessions will be needed if an agreement is to be reached.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s official spokesman said: “The discussions will be based on our largely common draft treaty texts.
“But significant differences do remain and key elements in the draft texts are not yet agreed. What we are working to do is seek solutions that fully respect UK sovereignty.
“Negotiators have been in contact almost every day since October 22 and they are continuing to work intensively to bridge the gaps that remain between us.
“But, although there has been some progress in recent days, there is much work to be done and time is now very short.
“So if we are to make further progress in the coming days, we need to see more realism from the EU on what it means for the UK to be an independent state.”
It came as a new YouGov poll suggested that no region in the UK, excluding Northern Ireland, was pro-Brexit.
‘Positive direction’
Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland earlier, Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said the talks in relation to fishing were not in a good place. 
“It’s not good, I mean that’s that’s the truth of it I mean the negotiations are not in a good place when it comes to fishing. There hasn’t really been any success in closing the gap between the positions of either side,” he said.
And until we can find a way of doing that, there isn’t going to be an agreement. So we’re in the same place in fishing, as we were in mid-summer. The neither side really has budged from their position, there’s been minor concessions discussed on both sides but really it hasn’t moved anywhere.
On the British side, Frost had attempted to sound optimistic, saying before today’s meeting that there had been progress in a “positive direction” in recent days.
However, he added the talks may not succeed and reiterated the point made by Boris Johnson that the country must be prepared for a departure with a deal or without.
Deadlines imposed on a future agreement have proven to be soft in the past, with Mr Johnson saying in September: “There needs to be an agreement with our European friends by the time of the European Council on October 15 if it’s going to be in force by the end of the year.

SUPPORT US NOW
“If we can’t agree by then, then I do not see that there will be a free trade agreement between us, and we should both accept that and move on.”
The mid-October deadline appeared to be scratched at the start of that month, when Downing Street and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen agreed to intensify talks during a video conference call, acknowledging “significant gaps remained” between the UK and Brussels.
Any deal struck would be subject to ratification by EU member states, the European Parliament and the UK Parliament meaning time is tight.
Centre stage
The agenda for Thursday’s meeting of 27 European leaders does not mention Brexit, with the response to the Covid-19 pandemic instead taking centre stage.
But with only one other meeting – between 10-11 December – scheduled before the end date of the transition period, they could be seen as a key moment in the shaping of the UK’s departure.
Coveney yesterday told Sky News that a deal was “doable”.
“I think I would sum it up by saying this is very difficult, but, it’s also very doable.
“And I think the consequences of not getting a trade deal and a future relationship deal … before the end of the year, I think is very significant.”","Chief British negotiator David Frost says he and his team are working hard for an agreement.",4,0,0,38946,"Nov 16th 2020, 7:21 AM"

Leo Cullen and Stuart Lancaster’s side were at their most ruthless against an Edinburgh team that barely fired a shot in response.
Ryan Baird made his return from injury off the bench for Leinster on what was a very happy Monday night for the eastern province, who made it six bonus-point wins from six games in the Guinness Pro14 so far this season.
To see man of the match Leavy come through his 57-minute shift unscathed was heartening for Leinster and Ireland supporters, with the flanker winning a turnover, tackling strongly, carrying aggressively, and generally looking powerful from the number six shirt.

Wing Cian Kelleher scored a hat-trick and scrum-half Luke McGrath grabbed a brace for Leinster, while Dave Kearney and Peter Dooley also got their names on the score sheet as impressive inside centre Ciarán Frawley kicked five conversions.

Leinster had the bonus point wrapped up by the break, with Dave Kearney first across the whitewash on the end of a superb 13th-minute try that started with Edinburgh overthrowing a five-metre lineout to spark the home side onto the counter-attack.
The ball was shifted wide left for outstanding fullback Jimmy O’Brien to grubber ahead and Leavy combined with Scott Penny to come away with a clean turnover in the Edinburgh 22. A phase later the flanker moved the ball to O’Brien, who cleverly grubbered to his left to allow Kearney to finish.
Kearney covered huge ground from right edge to left for Leinster’s second, breaking down the touchline after McGrath sniped into the shortside and then returning the pass inside for his scrum-half to race clear.
The third score came from close-range and initially saw a possible Leavy score chalked off before a second five-metre tap penalty resulted in loosehead Dooley bashing his way over. 
And Leinster notched their fourth just before the break when out-half Harry Byrne countered up the left and then Frawley delightfully stepped and offloaded to McGrath when the ball came back into midfield, allowing the scrum-half to dart home.

With Frawley having converted three of the tries, Leinster led 26-3 at the break - Nathan Chamberlain’s penalty having been the only response the Scots could muster in the first half.
Leavy got his try just two minutes in the second half, barreling over from close-range after another sweeping move had nearly resulted in Kelleher going over in the right corner. 
Kelleher had his first score just six minutes later – just after a yellow card for opposite number Eroni Sau for batting down a Leinster pass – as out-half Byrne calmly stroked a cross-kick over to the right for his wing to dot down. 
Kelleher scored his second in the 54th minute as the onslaught continued, O’Brien’s excellent pass putting him away in the same corner. 
With both sides ringing the changes, Leinster’s momentum eased off for a spell and replacement scrum-half Nic Groom sniped over for Edinburgh heading towards the final 10 minutes.
But Leinster got back into their flow in the closing stages, superb passes from replacement out-half David Hawkshaw and O’Brien sending Penny free and he offloaded to Kelleher for his hat-trick.

Mangrove Nine 
Last night, the filmmaker Steve McQueen launched his Small Axe series of films with one about the Mangrove Nine. Here’s a podcast about their story – which saw them win a landmark British court case after they organised a protest against racism.
(The Guardian, approx 26 mins listening time)
Guardian arts and culture correspondent Lanre Bakare tells Anushka about the 55-day trial that took place in the Old Bailey in 1971. All nine defendants were eventually acquitted of the main charges of incitement to riot. But what really moved the needle was Judge Edward Clarke’s closing comments. “What this trial has shown is that there is clearly evidence of racial hatred on both sides,” he told the courtroom. It was the first judicial acknowledgment of racism in the Met, three decades before the Macpherson inquiry. The story, Lanre says, has clear parallels with the Black Lives Matter protests of this summer.

“We do not want people asymptomatic people who feel completely well coming home to this country to meet their loved ones, to interact with their extended families across generations, older people, younger people people with medical conditions, we don’t want thousands of people doing that, resulting in hundreds or thousands of cases in January, and deaths and morbidity and mortality in January in February,” he said.

AN OPERATIVE FOR the so-called Islamic State has gone on trial in Paris on terror charges for swaggering bare-chested through a train in 2015 with an arsenal of weapons and shooting one passenger.
Opening a month-long trial for Ayoub El-Khazzani, the judge said the 31-year-old Moroccan with ties to a notorious terror mastermind intended to “kill all the passengers” aboard the Amsterdam to Paris train in 2015 but “lost control of events”.
One of the Americans who tackled the bare-chested gunman, who was laden with an arsenal of weapons and shot another passenger, told investigators that he seemed high on drugs and “completely crazy”, the judge said.
A lawyer for the two US servicemen and their friend, whose electrifying capture of El Khazzani inspired a Clint Eastwood movie, said their “very brave intervention” on 21 August 2015 thwarted a “slaughter”.
French lawyer Thibault de Montbrial, who is representing US soldiers who foiled the attack, speaks to media today.

“This terror attack could have killed up to 300 people based on the number of ammunition that was found on the terrorist and in his bag,” he said.
With El-Khazzani in court and watched by security officers, the trial opening today was largely taken up with procedural issues including whether Eastwood’s presence is needed.
That question was not immediately resolved. The actor-director has so far not responded to a summons.
Eastwood turned the 21 August 2015 drama in carriage No 12 into a film called ‘The 15:17 To Paris’.
El-Khazzani boarded the train in Brussels armed with a Kalashnikov, nine clips with 30 rounds each, an automatic pistol and a cutter, according to investigators.
He is charged with attempted terrorist murder for the foiled attack. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.
His lawyer, Sarah Mauger-Poliak, said El Khazzani “regrets having allowed himself to become indoctrinated” by extremist propaganda and wants “to demonstrate his remorse”.

Three others, who were not on the train, are also being tried for their roles as alleged accomplices.
Bilal Chatra, aged 24, an Algerian member of IS, would have been the second man on the train but dropped out of the plot a week earlier, it is alleged.
He had left Syria for Europe a week before to set up the exit route, prosecutors said.
Mohamed Bakkali allegedly took in the Europe-bound attackers in Budapest, Hungary, which he denies.
The two were arrested in Germany in 2016.
A third man, Redouane El Amrani Ezzerrifi, allegedly piloted a boat to help in their return to Europe.
The trial serves as a bridge to the massacre of 130 people in Paris three months later, on 13 November 2015, at the Bataclan music hall and restaurants and cafés.
The man considered the likely mastermind of those attacks, Abdel Hamid Abaaoud, was the behind-the-scenes force of the train attack, planned in Syria, according to the prosecution.
Abaaoud travelled from Syria to Belgium with El Khazzani to organise attacks in Europe, and was holed up with him and Chatra in a Brussels apartment, according to the prosecution.

Abaaoud was killed by French special forces days after the Bataclan attack.
But before his death, his macabre organisational skills were at work in a failed plan to attack a church south of Paris in April 2015 that left a young woman dead.
Sid Ahmed Ghlam was convicted earlier this month and sentenced to life in prison.
El Khazzani “knowingly followed Abaaoud, but it’s been years since he was in a jihadi mindset”, his lawyer Sarah Mauger-Poliak said in a phone interview.
“He is very affected and regrets having allowed himself to become indoctrinated in propaganda.”
The propaganda evolved into a plot to allegedly kill trapped passengers.
El Khazzani bought a train ticket at the Brussels station on 21 August 2015 for a 5.13pm departure.
He was armed with a Kalashnikov, nine clips with 30 rounds each, an automatic pistol and a cutter, according to investigators.
Once on the train, he lingered in a toilet between carriages and emerged bare-chested with a Kalashnikov, they said.

One waiting passenger struggled with the attacker, then a French-American, Mark Magoolian, wrestled the Kalashnikov away – before being shot himself by a pistol as he headed to carriage No 12 to warn his wife.
Magoolian said in interviews later that the attacker recovered the Kalashnikov.
Spencer Stone, a then-23-year-old US airman, said days after the attack that he was coming out of a deep sleep when the gunman appeared.

Alek Skarlatos, then a 22-year-old US National Guardsman recently back from Afghanistan, “just hit me on the shoulder and said, ‘Let’s go’”.
The three men, all from California, snapped into action out of what Skarlatos said at a news conference days later was “gut instinct”.
Stone and Skarlatos moved in to tackle the gunman and take his gun. The third friend, Anthony Sadler, aged 23, then a student, helped subdue the assailant.

Stone said he choked El Khazzani unconscious. 
A British businessman then joined in the fray.
Stone, whose hand was injured by the cutter, is also credited with saving the French-American teacher who was bleeding from the neck. 
Stone said he “just stuck two of my fingers in his hole and found what I thought to be the artery, pushed down and the bleeding stopped”.
El-Khazzani’s background
The train rerouted to Arras, in northern France, where El Khazzani was arrested.
El-Khazzani had left Morocco aged 18 to join his family in Spain.
In 2012, he established links with radicals.
He went to Brussels before heading to Turkey, a gateway to Syria.
A watch list signal “sounded” on 10 May 2015 in Berlin, where El-Khazzani was flying to Turkey, then-French interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve had said.
El-Khazzani told investigators that Abaaoud wanted him to kill only the American military men, a line he was likely to maintain during the trial.
The investigating judges consider it a dubious claim, in part because their presence on the train could not be known in advance and they were in civilian clothes.
That defence also fails to chime with Abaaoud’s goal of killing a maximum number of people during attacks.

628,245,"Opinion: Wild Mountain Thyme does what Hollywood has always done - sells 'Oirland' to Irish America",https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/wild-mountain-thyme-5268824-Nov2020/,"THE RELEASE OF the trailer for Wild Mountain Thyme attracted no shortage of justifiable complaints, as well as some entertainment for Irish people over the past week. 
Commentary on the film recognised the familiar features of many Irish-set American productions: appalling accents, a melodramatic love story, anachronistic rural settings, lots of seemingly unnecessary scenic shots, peculiar unstable characters and dress sense and the suggestion of a fondness for recreational violence.  
Credit where it’s due – the fact that all of this is evident within a trailer of fewer than three minutes is perhaps an achievement of some sorts. Most films require viewing in full before the range of stereotypes are apparent.  
But stereotypes are critical components of mainstream cinema. They allow a mass audience to readily identify and associate with characters and locations in the condensed format of the feature film, or the clipped content of a trailer. 
All cultures are subjected to them. We have the beret-wearing wine-drinking French, passionate Italians or humourless and efficient Germans.  
What’s behind ‘Oirish’ accent?
To appreciate the continuing resonance with audiences of the stereotypes associated with Ireland, it is worth recalling that Wild Mountain Thyme follows in a long line of productions with American origins and hopes of attracting US audiences, particularly those with Irish ancestry.  
The first fiction film ever made in Ireland, at least partly, was produced and informed by a similar perspective and concern.  
The Lad from Old Ireland was produced in 1910 by the New York-based Kalem company. The director was Sidney Olcott, a Canadian of Irish descent who wished to return to his mother’s homeland to make the first American production to be shot on location outside the US. Scenes were filmed in the Killarney area and in New York.  
Its central story follows an Irish emigrant Terry O’Connor (played by Olcott) who becomes successful in the US before returning to save his family from eviction.
The film struck a chord with audiences in the US and Olcott returned to make many other films in Ireland between 1911 and 1914.

The Kalem films are predominantly set in rural areas, highlighting the landscape, particularly the lakes of Killarney area, and characters and settings from the past.
But even then, in the 1910s, Irish people were sensitive to the country’s portrayal in American cinema.  
Robert G Vignola, an actor and director with Kalem, recalled in an interview many years later how the local parish priest, in the Beaufort area where they were based, denounced “tramp photographers” who focused on the “thatched cottages” rather than homes with slate roofs. 
Despite this criticism, Olcott’s work was actually a considerable improvement on previous depictions of Irishness in American popular culture, which leaned heavily on characteristics of drunkenness, laziness and violence.  
As the 20th century developed, depictions of Ireland in Hollywood evolved as the Irish American community increased in influence and status and sought more positive depictions of their homeland and heritage.  
An Irish-American romantic imaginary evolved in cinema. It was nostalgic, traditional, rurally focused and untarnished by the arrival of modernity or technology. It was an Ireland that never existed but provided a welcome and reassuring contrast to the challenges of modern American life.  
Artistic license
This romantic imaginary occasionally led to the rewriting of history.  
In 1936 Michael Collins renamed Dennis Riordan, was portrayed as surviving an assassination attempt and living happily ever after with his English aristocratic lover in the Samuel Goldwyn production Beloved Enemy.  
A year later Clarke Gable portrayed Charles Stuart Parnell in MGM’s Parnell, a highly sanitised account of the politician’s affair with Katie O’Shea.
The film is widely regarded as Gable’s worst performance, though he did overcome the challenge of adopting a convincing Irish accent by not attempting it at all. 
Perhaps more than any other film, Irish American director John Ford’s greatest commercial success The Quiet Man (1952) was responsible for popularising the tropes and accents found in Wild Mountain Thyme.

Bord Fáilte was established the year the film was released and Ford provided a template, particularly through the film’s impressive technicolor landscape cinematography, for the promotion of Ireland internationally in subsequent decades.  
The film depicts Ireland as a recuperative space for returning emigrant Sean Thornton, left traumatised by the accidental killing of an opponent in the boxing ring.   
Shanley’s approach
The director of Wild Mountain Thyme, Irish-American John Patrick Shanley seems informed by a similar romantic imaginary. 
According to the 2017 US census, about 33 million people in America claim Irish heritage. That’s potentially a huge market for depictions of Ireland. The vast majority of this population have never been to Ireland and their perspective is far removed in time, space and accent. 
Rosita Boland confirmed this in a revealing series of interviews with the Irish-American community in Boston in 2016. She found their view of Ireland was as an “abstract, romanticised receptacle of dreams and green fields, and the place that will soothe a lifelong ache”. 
Kevin Rocket’s Irish Filmography (1996), lists more than 2000 films, about half of which originated in the US. Fewer than 10% came out of Ireland.  
Thankfully more films are being made in Ireland today than ever before, but the legacy of the Irish-American tradition continues to be strong and influential, shaping how the world views this island and the accents they associate with it.

Daily case numbers had been declining up until late last week, but the average daily 5-day case count is rising, now at over 400 per day. 
Today the Department of Health reported 456 new cases of Covid-19.
Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Ronan Glynn said: “We are concerned that, unfortunately, the very positive trajectory we have been reporting in recent weeks has at best stalled and in fact according to a number of indicators is now deteriorating.
“We really have a short period of time to turn this around, we’ve two weeks to go before December 1st and I’d like to take the opportunity this evening to implore people not to focus on Christmas unduly, not to focus on levels, whether it’s level 2,3,4, or 5, but really to start focusing again on the basics.”
He said there have been outbreaks linked to funerals, family gatherings and student activities as well as clusters in some workplaces. Glynn said he cannot rule out a connection in some cases to Halloween events, but he said most people managed Halloween reponsibly.
This recent spike, he said, can not be attributed to any one cause or settings and it may be that people are “getting tired of listening to the messages”. 
“We have seen a number of clusters linked with extended family get-togethers, with student get-togethers, but this is on the back of millions of people doing the right thing, it’s on the back of a very substantial decrease in incidence amongst younger people, for example,” he said.

“On the one hand it would be an easier message for me tonight if I could point to a particular group or particular set of behaviours that’s causing us particular concern. From our perspective it’s actually more concerning that we can’ t pinpoint any one behaviour or any one group.”
He said the National Public Health Emergency Team cannot predict what the situation will look like two weeks from now but he said they are “certainly more concerned now than we were last Thursday”.
“The issue here is that it’s all over our communities and what we’re seeing is lots and lots of small clusters all across the country, that makes it very difficult for us to put in place a policy measure to stop that. Ultimately the key thing that will stop that over the coming days is people’s behaviour.”
Dr Glynn also commented on videos shared on social media at the weekend of crowds drinking together on streets in Dublin and Cork. 
“Behaviour like that in any setting is frustrating and I’m not talking about for us, it’s particularly frustrating for literally the millions of people within our population who are doing the right thing,” he said.

He said it is particularly disheartening for older and vulnerable people who have been isolating themselves for months to protect themselves. 
He asked people not to get distracted by these examples and to remember that there is “a very significant silent majority out there who are doing the right things, who are keeping themselves and their families safe, and ultimately keeping each and every one of us in our communities safe”.","The average daily 5-day case count is rising, now at over 400 per day.",3,0,0,45954,"Nov 16th 2020, 7:53 PM"

There are 7,500 more people on the PUP this week compared to last week, and the cost has increased to €103.8 million, up from €99 million last week.
The sector with the highest number of people in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment is accommodation and food service activities (102,682) followed by wholesale and retail trade (57,015) and other sectors eg, hairdressers and beauty salons (31,048).
This week’s figures are in addition to the 203,172 unemployed people who are on the Live Register as of the end of October.
All Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payments issued will be in recipients’ bank accounts or at their local post office tomorrow.
Commenting on this week’s figures, Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys said:
“While the number of people receiving PUP has increased again this week, it is heartening to see the rate of increase reduce.
“The overall number is also much smaller than during the first period of Level 5 restrictions in March and April.
This reflects the fact that a wider range of sectors have been able to continue trading, such as in construction and manufacturing.
“As Minister for Social Protection, I will continue to ensure that our welfare supports are available to the people who need them most during this difficult time.

This means that people who only commenced employment after February 2020 but have now been laid-off due to increased restrictions can have their payment rate fixed by reference to their earnings from January to September.
As a result of this change, some 37,430 people receiving PUP this week will see an increase in their rate of payment. No one will have their weekly rate of payment reduced as a result of this re-assessment of their earnings.
The PUP is paid at four rates (from 2 October):
Those with prior gross weekly earnings below €200 will continue to receive a rate of €203 per week.
Those with prior gross weekly earnings of €200 to €299.99 will continue to receive €250 per week.
Those with prior gross weekly earnings of €300 to €399.99 will continue to receive €300 per week.
Those with prior gross weekly earnings of €400 or more will receive a rate of €350 per week.

Celyn Eadon’s sentence hearing at the Central Criminal Court was interrupted a number of times and his video link turned off for a time today after he shouted abuse at the prosecutor while a list of his mother’s stab wounds was being detailed.
The State had accepted the now 29-year-old’s plea to the lesser offence earlier this month, on the basis that intoxication can prevent the formation of the statutory intent needed for murder.
Eadon was 19 when he killed his 46-year-old mother in the early hours of 9 March, 2011.
Noreen Kelly was stabbed 19 times in their home at Derrycrieve, Islandeady, near Castlebar in Co Mayo.
The accused admitted to her killing that day and pleaded guilty to her manslaughter.
However, a jury found him guilty of her murder, and he was sentenced to the mandatory term of life imprisonment in February 2014.
The defendant had his conviction for murder overturned last December, when a five-judge Supreme Court ruled that it was unsafe.
The higher court found that the trial judge’s instruction to the jury on intoxication and specific intention was inadequate, as it had not informed the jury of the “vitally important point” that intoxication can be a partial defence to murder.
The Supreme Court noted in its judgment that since Eadon was aged 13, he was a significant and persistent abuser of alcohol and drugs, including amphetamines, cocaine and crystal meth.
The Director of Public Prosecutions had to decide whether to pursue a retrial on the murder charge. However, the Central Criminal Court was told that the DPP was accepting the plea to manslaughter on the basis of intoxication.
Burnt drugs
Detective Sergeant James Carroll today told Seamus Clarke SC, prosecuting, that the deceased had taken drugs from her son’s bedroom and burnt them on the evening before she died.
She had also put out two fires he had lit and put a chainsaw into the boot of her car.
Both her brother and Eadon’s father stated that she had called them to the house that evening for help. The father of the accused, Mark Eadon, said his son was starry-eyed and he was convinced the teenager was on speed. He left at 11pm.
Eadon’s younger brother dialled 999 at 1.38am. He had been woken by his mother screaming for help and had found her slumped on the floor, with her face covered in blood.
The house was full of smoke and the deceased showed no signs of life by the time emergency services arrived.
Her killer had fled cross-country, and a neighbour noticed him in his back garden at breakfast time. Eadon told the neighbour that he had been abducted by aliens, who had conducted experiments on him, and that he had killed his mother.
He later told gardaí that “she went for” him, that he didn’t know it was his mother and that she was a totally different person.
He said that he had clipped her with a knife that he’d had in his pocket for five to ten minutes.
Hearing continued in absence
Eadon, who has been in custody since that day, was offered a seat in the room in prison from where he followed the sentence hearing by video link.
He preferred to stand, but had sat down and could no-longer be seen by the time the prosecution counsel was leading the sergeant through the pathology report.
Counsel detailed the stab wounds to the eye, brain, jugular, lung, liver and other areas of the deceased. These had caused catastrophic haemorrhage. There were also classic defence injuries to her arms and legs. He said death would have been rapid.
Clarke then proceeded to go into more detail about each of the 19 stab wounds.
Eadon stood back up and accused him of listing more injuries than she had, saying: “You f**ing w**ker,” he said. “You f**ing annoying b**tard. You f***ing asshole.”
Mr Justice Michael White asked Eadon’s barrister, Patrick Gageby SC, about the possibility of turning off the link to the prison, and the barrister confirmed that the judge had discretion.
The judge then instructed that the hearing continue in Eadon’s absence for a time.
The court heard that Eadon now has 13 convictions, mostly for assaults causing harm, carried out since he began his life sentence.
‘She would have forgiven him’
Counsel for the prosecution read out a victim impact statement prepared by Mark Eadon, the deceased’s former husband and Eadon’s father.
He said that his wife had lost her life trying to protect her child.

“I do not blame Celyn for what happened anymore,” he said. “I’m sure, had she survived, she would have forgiven him.”
He said that young people now are under great pressures.
“The international drugs trade has almost every nation in its grip,” he concluded.
At this stage, the link to the prison was reconnected and Eadon asked why counsel for the prosecution was “lying” about his mother’s injuries.
His barrister explained that his client had always become “exercised” when his mother’s injuries were mentioned.
However, Eadon continued to speak even when the barrister began cross examining the sergeant about other matters.
The hearing continued, with the sergeant confirming that the deceased had tried to have her son admitted to hospital, but had been told that the gardaí would need to be involved.
Eadon rubbed tears from his eyes as his barrister read out a letter he had written.
“I didn’t set out to kill my mother,” he wrote. “I pray to God my mother can forgive me.”
He wrote that he felt like a bad person, and had to learn to live with it.
“I wish I could go back to that night in question,” he continued. “My mother is gone forever because of me.”
The judge informed Eadon that he was adjourning the case so that the Probation Service could put a structure in place if he was to be released from prison.
He remanded him in custody until 8 February, when he will hear final submissions.

The deal, to be signed Tuesday, brings to five the number of vaccines the EU will have in its portfolio, with a sixth, from US firm Moderna, on its way.
European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen confirmed the deal would be signed in a video message today.
The portfolio already includes a contract for 300 million doses of a vaccine produced by German company BioNTech and US giant Pfizer which both manufacturers say has proven 90 percent effective against Covid-19.
“The coronavirus continues to spread rapidly across Europe. We need a safe and effective vaccine to end this pandemic”, von der Leyen said.
The CureVac contract is an option to buy up to 405 million doses if its vaccine is proven to be safe and effective.
Von der Leyen did not disclose the financial terms, in line with the same confidentiality given the other companies making candidate vaccines.
The EU chief said the European Medicines Agency would assess the potential vaccines and only authorise them if they passed health standards.
“This is why we need to have a broad portfolio of vaccines based on very different technologies,” von der Leyen said.
The European Union’s population is 450 million. It is unknown at this stage how long the effects of a viable vaccine might last or if one, two or more jabs could be needed to create human resistance to the coronavirus.

No vaccine has yet been shown to be effective for large-scale production, but there are hopes at least one might be rushed to market by early next year.
Clinical results from the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine are still being evaluated.
Aware of criticism that wealthy countries were snapping up millions of doses of possible vaccines, von der Leyen stressed that the EU was working with a World Health Organization-backed initiative called COVAX to get successful Covid-19 jabs to poorer nations.
The news comes the same day that Moderna announced that its experimental vaccine against Covid-19 was shown to be 94.5% effective in early results from a clinical trial with more than 30,000 participants.

Mr Justice Paul McDermott delivered the sentence this afternoon after hearing emotional statements from the deceased’s parents Hajiba and Abdul and his cousin Younes Talibi.
Azzam’s parents Hajiba and Abdul said they wanted to do something good for their communities when they moved to Ireland and are proud of what their children have achieved.
Hajiba repeatedly asked why her “kind” son was taken from her in an argument over a bicycle, “something cheap”.
She said she wanted justice for her “loving, kind, gentle, well-behaved, faithful and loyal son” and accused her son’s killer of having “no regard for human life”.
Abdul said that he could not get the image out of his head of the killer on CCTV celebrating and “high-fiving” with friends after the fatal attack.
He added: “In addition to losing my son in a heinous crime I also lost myself, my wife and two kids, as we have never been the same.”
The 17-year-old defendant, who cannot be identified because he is a minor, was found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter by a jury in September.
He had previously offered to plead guilty to manslaughter but the Director of Public Prosecutions rejected the plea.
His mother, father and brother joined the defendant for a group hug after the judge delivered his sentence.
Stabbed five times
The victim, Azzam Raguragui, died after the defendant stabbed him five times during a melee in Finsbury Park, Dundrum, Dublin 14 on 10 May, 2019.
The trial heard that one of the wounds severed an artery and caused massive blood loss which led to his death.
The judge today said that the jury’s verdict means that the prosecution had not proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused inflicted the fatal wound after the teenager fell to the ground having tried to run away from the fight.
He said the fatal wound was inflicted in the midst of a violent and frightening fight involving two groups of teenagers and that the accused believed he was acting in self-defence or in defence of his friends.
However, the judge said that the accused brought the knife, adding: “Any person who equips themselves with a dangerous weapon like this and uses it in the circumstances described can only expect a court to view that as a seriously aggravating factor.”
A further aggravating factor was his failure to seek assistance although he knew he had repeatedly stabbed and wounded the deceased.
He showed a “callous disregard to the predicament of the deceased at the time”, the judge said.
He also noted that the defendant pursued the deceased having already inflicted the fatal wound, and assaulted him in a “cowardly” way while Raguragui lay in the foetal position on the ground.
He further pointed to the defendant’s attempt to dispose of evidence by throwing away the knife and CCTV footage which showed him assembling with friends shortly afterwards where “he does not appear to be in any way shocked or to regret what he had done.
He did not know at that stage that the wounds were fatal, but what he had done was in any view “shocking and disturbing”, the judge said.
Mitigating factors included his early guilty plea, cooperation with gardai in helping them to retrieve the knife and his young age at the time of the offence.
‘That brightness is now gone’
In his statement, the father of the deceased, Abdul Raguragui, broke down frequently as he described how proud he is of his eldest son, a “caring and loving” boy with a “great personality” who supported his parents and siblings.
He said: “He was handsome, athletic, funny, honest and truly enjoyed his life. He had a lot of friends who witnessed his respect and kindness.”
“The first thing everyone would notice about Azzam was his smile,” Raguragui said.
“I never remember him without that smile, he was the light of the house, The brightness in every room. But suddenly that brightness is now gone.”
He also said that he is haunted by his son’s final moments, “a short, sharp knife shredding his body”, and by the CCTV footage showing his son’s killer celebrating and “high-fiving” with friends after the fatal assault.

“His precious life can never be returned,” Raguragui said.
“His chair will always be empty around our dinner table. I will have to take my wife and kids to an empty graveyard with only memories left of a kind and faithful and loyal son with a smile that I won’t get to see any more.”
He said he still has sleepless nights and will never forget the way “an innocent boy was tortured and murdered”.
‘Who can do that?’
Meanwhile, Mrs Raguragui said it is hard to talk about the loss of her son.
“Azzam was always a loving, kind, gentle, well-behaved, faithful and loyal son who comes from an excellent family, well respected in the Muslim community and in Irish society,” she said.
“His friends named him ‘Smiley’ as he always had a beautiful smile on his face.”
She also said her son supported people in need and volunteered to work with elderly people in his neighbourhood, even clearing their driveways of ice and snow during the winter.
She described seeing Azzam in hospital “covered in blood from head to toe”.
“I couldn’t believe that was my handsome son,” she said.
She wondered how she would tell her family that her innocent son was dead, and asked: “Who can do that? It’s not a human, it’s an evil because he didn’t do anything wrong.”
She said that her dream when she came to Ireland was that her children would succeed and she is proud of what they have achieved, but that Azzam’s dreams have all gone away.
She said words cannot express the depth of her family’s loss, adding: “It’s hard for a mum to bury a son.”
“It’s not fair,” she said. “Why? he didn’t do anything wrong.”","Azzam Raguragui (18) died after suffering five stab wounds on 10 May 2019.",43,0,0,34321,"Nov 16th 2020, 6:08 PM"

‘Stick with us’
Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Ronan Glynn says NPHET is concerned that the positive trajectory they’ve been reporting in recent weeks has “at best stalled”.
According to a number of indicators, including daily case numbers, he said it may be deteriorating.

Socialising, funerals and people 'taking their eye off the ball': Concerns over uptick in Covid cases
Though there was no one cause of an increase in cases, Glynn listed some examples of outbreaks and clusters in recent days.
These include workplaces – the construction sector and food processing sectors were mentioned – and funerals, as well as student gatherings (one in Limerick was specifically mentioned) and extended family gatherings.
Dr Glynn asked people to focus on adhering to the restrictions for the next 10 days to two weeks. When asked by TheJournal.ie about exiting Level 5 in two weeks’ time, Dr Glynn said:
One of the biggest single detriments to our progress is an overt focus on where we might be in six weeks’ time. 
We don’t know where we’ll be in two weeks’ time… What dictates that is what people do today, tomorrow and the next day.
 ”The last thing we want is more people getting sick, the last thing we want is more people in hospital, the last thing we want is further deaths,” Dr Glynn said.
Glynn said that scenes of people drinking on the street in Dublin and Cork at the weekend were “frustrating” for a lot of people, including older people and other vulnerable people who may have been cocooning for months.
“Stick with us… I know people are tired,” Dr Glynn said. “I think in broad terms, people may just be getting tired of listening to the messages.”

636,247,"Opinion: 'He was a local hero after Jadotville - but that's not how he remembers it'",https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/siege-of-jadotville-5268457-Nov2020/,"This week we learned that an expert group has been assembled, consisting of ex-military officers, a historian and an academic to examine the issue of medals for Gallantry for soldiers in the Siege of Jadotville in 1961.
Here, the daughter of one of the survivors reacts to these developments and pays tribute to her dad and his comrades:
THE SIEGE OF Jadotville which took place in the Congo in September 1961 found a place in the national psyche in 2016 after the Netflix release of the movie of the same name starring Jamie Dornan.
During the siege, 155 Irish peacekeepers with no battle experience held out for five days against more than 3,000 heavily armed mercenaries and local militias and one Fouga fighter jet which repeatedly strafed the position of the Irish troops from the air.
“A” Company did not suffer a single fatality while they inflicted 300 fatalities and 750 injuries on the other side. Their commanding officer Colonel Pat Quinlan was a gifted tactician and a leader enormously respected by his men.
The tactics employed by the Irish soldiers are now studied as an exemplar of defence techniques in military colleges around the world. There is no doubt about the military excellence of “A” Company.
However, for years after the battle Col. Quinlan and his men were derided in Ireland because, having run out of food, water and ammunition and with no hope of the arrival of reinforcements, and having negotiated an acceptable ceasefire agreement (which the enemy did not honour) they became prisoners of war for six weeks.
They were branded “Jadotville Jacks”, meaning cowards.
Each soldier of “A” Company fought the real battle after returning from Jadotville. The army turned their backs on them, they fought depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Several died by suicide, drug abuse or alcoholism. There are too many stories of broken families.
My father was one
In my journey of learning my father’s story, I have been so saddened and deeply affected to hear the stories of the men for whom the battle was just too hard.
For example, a young man in my fathers’ mortar crew who was just 16 at the time. After Jadotville, he went to Australia to try to escape his demons and later took his own life. That young man deserved better than that. That family deserved better.
These men and many who died in later years did not live long enough to receive the Unit Citation or the Bonn Jadotville which accompanied that Unit Citation. They never saw the acknowledgement that came 56 years too late.
After the Siege of Jadotville, 33 men were recommended for medals by Col. Quinlan on their return to Ireland. Commandant Leo Quinlan, son of Col. Quinlan has fought for many years to have these medals awarded to the eight men still living and posthumously to the families of those who have passed away.

He and others such as the late Captain Liam Donnelly, John Gorman and Declan Power, have fought for these men to have the recognition they deserved. Only eight of these 33 men are still alive. Of the five men recommended for the MMG, my father is the only surviving soldier.
My father, Cpl. Tadhg Quinn, hailing from Port in Abbeyfeale is one of the five men who were recommended for the two highest military honours; the MMG (Medal for Military Gallantry) and DSM (Distinguished Service Medal). 
Isn’t that amazing? An 18-year-old young fella from Abbeyfeale went to Africa, experienced something most of us couldn’t even imagine and came back having given such a good account of himself that his commanding officer felt it appropriate to recommend him for the two highest military honours.
In Jadotville, Dad commanded a mortar crew. He had a number of mortars for which he was responsible and a crew of men who were dug into positions in the town of Jadotville and whose job it was to “neutralise” long-range targets up to a mile away.
Knowing my Dad, he was perfectly matched to this task. He has an uncanny ability to predict distances and eagle-like long-distance vision.
Helena and her father
In the movie, Dad is seen calling ranges to target a convoy of trucks which were supplying the attackers with ammunition and reinforcements. The normal procedure would have been to send a smoke shell first to check the range before sending a live shell. Dad recalls not having time to send a smoke shell and having to quickly estimate the range and instruct his men.
It was a direct hit. We can only imagine what the butterfly effect of that one action, that decision taken in the heat of the moment with no time for doubt or hesitation, was.

Irish soldiers to finally be awarded medals for Siege of Jadotville - 55 years on
What would have happened if those reinforcements and ammunitions had made it to the attackers? How many young Irish lives might have been lost? This example is just to give you a sense of what my father did but he was amongst 155 heroes so he was in good company. 
Prisoner to local hero
When the siege ended, Dad was taken prisoner along with his comrades. He recounts the first night of captivity being worse than the days that came before it because he had no weapon, no way of protecting himself, no understanding of what was going to come next, knowing he and his comrades were pawns in a game that was being played out in Dublin, New York and Leopoldville (now Kinshasa). 
To give you a sense of the level at which this episode in United Nations history was played out, the UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld flew to the Congo to hold talks to try to negotiate a cease-fire between the United Nations operation in the Congo and the Katangese troops.
His plane was shot down over what is now Zambia and he perished in the crash. It is generally accepted that Hammersköld was murdered by the Katangese.
When asked about Hammersköld, JFK’s response was: “I realise now that in comparison to him, I am a small man. He was the greatest statesman of our century”. 
Eventually, terms were agreed and the men were released in late October. They were immediately re-armed and were sent straight back into action. The Company returned to Ireland in stages from the end of November until late December 1961.

“A” Company was in continuous combat in the famous “Tunnel” in Elizabethville (now Lubumbashi) right up to the date of repatriation home and Dad was in the thick of this all the time before he took the last flight home arriving on Christmas Eve. 
He arrived home to his parents on that winter’s morning and drank a whiskey with his Grandfather. He speaks about the difficulty adjusting to life in Abbeyfeale. He cut quite a dash at mass on Christmas morning.
Everyone knew who he was, of course at that time the whole community were wracked with worry for the young man from Port who was “captured by the Balubas” in the Congo and very relieved to have him home safely.
A local man told me years later about how, as a boy much younger than Dad, he remembered that Christmas morning mass. He was awestruck by Dad and thought he was a hero.
Dad recalls that morning mass very differently, wrought with anxiety and feeling completely dislocated. He had experienced something that he didn’t have the tools to come to terms with and the local boys just wanted to know how many people he had killed.
Finding it almost impossible to adjust, Dad returned to barracks and was redeployed to the Congo in 1962. As it happened, he was hospitalised with tonsillitis just before deployment so he had to wait until the next deployment some months later before he returned to the Congo for his second tour of duty. But he returned…

A story, untold
Fast forward many years, and my mother, my siblings and I are learning the story of our family. Dad never spoke about Jadotville until after the death of his mother in 2002. It was locked up in the family secrets box and left there until at the age of 60, he was able to peek inside the box again. He let us have a look inside too and we have all embarked on this journey together.
Learning our family story has helped us make sense of so much in our own lives. Our Dad was one of the lucky ones; he didn’t look for comfort at the bottom of a bottle of whiskey, the demons didn’t win and drive him to suicide as happened with too many other men of “A” Company.
He had to fight his battle and win it. It has not been easy for him and in some ways, it has not been easy for my mother or us. 
Seeing the men of “A” Company finally being recognised and commended as a unit has meant more to all of us than I could ever articulate in words. Every girl thinks that their daddy is a hero but there are medals, monuments and citations to prove that mine really is. For my father, it was acknowledgement at last.
Jadotville is Dad’s story but, in a way, it is our story too. Whether or not they are ever awarded, the medals for which my Dad was recommended are an important part of our family story and our family history. 
There is so much to learn from our story and the story of the young fella from Abbeyfeale, the importance of raising our heads high and acknowledging the good work of our armed forces, the understanding of mental health and post-traumatic stress disorder in our acting military and veterans, the impact of that on veterans’ families.
So many families have had to take the thorny path. We just happen to be one of the lucky families.

The Netflix documentary is a three-part series, while the Sky Studios series ’Murder at the Cottage: The search for justice for Sophie’ is a five-part series directed by Jim Sheridan.
Two days before Christmas in 1996, 39-year-old Sophie Toscan du Plantier was found murdered outside her holiday cottage in Schull, west Cork.
English journalist Ian Bailey – the first reporter on the scene – was arrested and questioned by Gardaí, but was never charged or faced trial in Ireland. He has maintained his innocence for the past 24 years.
The murder has remained unsolved, and has prompted podcasts, inspired books, and been at the centre of the media for over two decades.
Bailey was found guilty in absentia by the French courts in 2019 and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Having successfully fought three extradition requests by the French authorities, he still lives in west Cork.
The Irish government has said that the State would not appeal the Irish High Courts’ refusal to extradite Bailey to France.
‘Murder at the Cottage: The search for justice for Sophie’
This is the first documentary series by Sheridan, a six-time Oscar nominee of films such as ‘My Left Foot’, and ‘In The Name of the Father’.
‘Murder at the Cottage: The search for justice for Sophie’, features “access” to Sophie’s family and Ian Bailey. The series is expected to air on Sky Crime next year.
Sheridan narrates the documentary and appears on-screen.

The press release sent this morning states: “The series pieces together original evidence, never-before-seen footage and interviews with those closest to the case as Sheridan tries to make sense of what happened that night; all set against the rural landscapes and wilderness of his home country.” 
Director and producer Sheridan said that this story “has fascinated me for over two decades”.
It is a murder that carries implications for the meaning of justice in Ireland, in France and in the UK. It is a murder that calls into question the meaning of Europe, as the convicted man in France is free in Ireland.
It is a story that calls into question the meaning and process of the police and the legal system. It is a story that shines a light on domestic violence. It is a story about primal fear. About a devil in the hills. About the existence of evil among us.

This Netflix series will be produced by Lightbox and claims to have “exclusive access” to Sophie Toscan du Plantier’s family and will “bring together the testimony of her entire family with that of Ian Bailey”.
A press release sent this afternoon said:
The series charts the story of Sophie’s life and rigorously details the investigation into her death, exposing the enduring mysteries and questions at the heart of this case. 
John Dower is the director of this series. His previous work includes ‘My Scientology Movie’, and ‘Thriller in Manilla’, which won many awards including a Grierson and a Peabody.
Simon Chinn, the executive producer co-founder of Lightbox said: “This series will take viewers on a journey filled with unexpected twists and turns as we carefully unravel an extraordinary story from its beginning, 24 years ago, to the present day.

DAVY FITZGERALD IS to stay on as Wexford senior hurling boss for the 2021 season.
Fitzgerald saw his side exit this year’s championship at the hands of Clare with Saturday’s qualifier defeat, a fortnight after relinquishing their Leinster title with a 13-point loss to Galway.
Last September it was announced that the Clare All-Ireland winner had agreed to stay in charge for a further two years after a brilliant 2019 campaign that saw them land provincial honours and run eventual champions Tipperary close at the semi-final stage.
And he has now decided to see out that new two-year term, ensuring he will be at the helm for a fifth season.
“He rang me today to say he texted the players and is committed to Wexford for 2021,” chairman Derek Kent, who is soon finishing up in that role, told The42 today.
“The working relationship this county board have with Davy has been a great relationship. To be fair to Davy if he had an issue or problem, we resolved it.
“If it was a case he only wanted to do one year, that’s fair enough but it was there for him for the second year. I’d no doubt with the feedback I’m getting from around Wexford and the players that he would remain as manager of the senior hurling team.
“We’ll have a change of guard in Wexford in two weeks time. The only one that’s finishing up in Wexford GAA is myself. It’ll be for the next administration to discuss what’s happening in 2021.”

The disappointing nature of this year’s displays had raised doubt over Fitzgerald’s future. Speaking after Saturday’s game in O’Moore Park he revealed he would take his time in deciding whether to commit again and would only stay if it was ‘for the betterment of the team’.
Wexford’s performances have come in for criticism with Kilkenny great Henry Shefflin pointing out on The Sunday Game last night that he believes they have looked ‘over-coached’ and ‘devoid of ideas’.
Given the turbulent nature of 2020, Kent feels there is some perspective needed in assessing the season and is content with the positive asepects during his involvement as chairman in recent years.

The inter-county didn’t work out for us, move on, regroup. 2021 is another year for another administration to look after.
“To be honest the highlight of my tenure as chairman was uniting the county board. This year getting our local championships going – Wexford were the first out with that, the footballers fulfilling their fixtures, getting out of Division 1B after so many years and getting into the top grade, so there’s been more positives than negatives.”

The limit for public gatherings, until now set to between 50 and 300 people depending on the type of event, will be reduced to eight from 24 November, an “unprecedented” measure deemed “necessary” to curb the spread of the virus, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven told reporters.
On Friday, the last day for which national data is available, Sweden reported a daily record of 5,990 cases, bringing its overall total to 177,355 cases since the start of the pandemic and 6,164 deaths.
It’s 14-day average incidence rate per 100,000 of the population is 511. This compares with an incidence rate of 120 in Ireland.
The new ban only applies to public gatherings such as sporting and cultural events, as the government does not have the authority to ban private gatherings in homes.
Schools and restaurants will stay open, for example, though the latter have already been limited to a maximum of eight people per table.
Swedes have also already been advised not to socialise with anyone outside their household. Sweden is one of the only regions in the world that doesn’t recommend wearing face coverings. 
Lofven sounded an ominous note on the importance of limiting social contacts.
“It’s going to get worse. Do your duty and take responsibility for stopping the spread of the virus,” he said.

Last week, the government announced that bars and restaurants would no longer be allowed to serve alcohol after 10pm from 20 November until the end of February.
Media reported that many clubs and bars were jam-packed this past weekend as youths took advantage of the last opportunity for late-night partying.
Lofven said the recent measures being introduced were necessary because fewer Swedes were following the government’s recommendations than at the start of the pandemic.
“In the spring, we saw large compliance. It was enough to have recommendations to get most people to keep their distance and cancel their plans. Now there is less compliance,” he said.","Sweden has taken a loose approach to restrictions up until now.

The slippage occurred at the site of the Meenbog Wind Farm last week and has been described by a local TD as “shocking but not surprising”.
Staff attended the site on Friday and over the weekend, and a spokeswoman for the local authority said the investigation will focus on mitigating the impact of the incident, determining its cause and preventing further pollution.

Thomas Pringle has said he will raise the issue in the Dáil this week, after a video of the incident showing a row of standing trees slipping downstream was posted to social media.
The Donegal TD said the issue has been seen a number of times across the country and claimed that independent environmental assessments could be undertaken as part of the planning process to prevent similar slippages in future.
“If you want to develop a wind farm, you [could] pay €100,000 to the council and the council actually carries out an independent assessment of it,” he told Highland Radio this morning.
“And if that independent assessment recommends that controls be put in place, that would be included in the planning permission.
“That would go very quickly, I think, in sorting all these problems out.”

643,213,"Pandemic Unemployment Payment is subject to income tax, Dáil Finance Committee agrees",https://www.thejournal.ie/finance-bill-pup-tax-5268758-Nov2020/,"THE OIREACHTAS FINANCE Committee has voted in favour of a section of the Finance Bill, which clarifies that the Pandemic Unemployment Payment is subject to income tax.
The weekly payment was rolled out in March for workers who lost income as a result of government-imposed public health restrictions.
Over the course of its lifespan, government ministers and the Revenue Commissioners have said that the payment, like other social welfare payments, is subject to income tax.
This is despite the fact that when the PUP was given legal footing in August, the government characterised all payments under the scheme made between April and August as “urgent needs payments” under Section 202 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.
Payments of this type are usually not subject to tax.
The Finance Bill, which will give legislative effect to Budget 2021, is currently being debated by Members of the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.
Opposition TDs have accused the government of trying to ‘sneak’ a section into that bill, which enshrines the taxability of the PUP in Irish law.
But speaking in front of the Oireachtas Finance Committee this morning, Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said that the initial characterisation of the PUP as a Section 202 payment was simply a matter of convenience.
“These payments were paid out under Section 202 of that bill because of the need to make these payments quickly and to associate them with a relevant clause in the social welfare legislation,” he said.
Unlike other Section 202 payments, he said, the PUP is not “means-tested” and is therefore subject to tax.
“I want to make clear though, from the very start, the intention of the government was that those payments would be taxed and they will be treated in the same way as we tax other equivalent social welfare payments,” Donohoe added. 
Sinn Féin finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty accused the minister of  “trying to rewind back the clock and to make a payment that was paid to people who lost their jobs during the pandemic, taxable”.

“I think there are serious issues in relation to this, particularly around the principle of retrospective taxation. Regardless of whatever the minister’s personal intentions were or the government’s personal intentions, the legal basis for this payment that was paid out — which was hundreds of millions of euro at the time — was Section 202 of the Social Welfare Act, and therefore, as a result, was not taxable.”
The Committee voted in favour of the section of Finance Bill by five votes to four this afternoon.
In September, Revenue confirmed that PUP recipients will have the option to pay back whatever tax is owed at the end of 2020 if they wish.
Alternatively, they can allow the Revenue to deduct the liabilities through reductions in their tax credits over a period of four years.","The Committee voted in favour of the Finance Bill clause this afternoon.",117,0,2,110603,"Nov 16th 2020, 3:40 PM"

Azzam Raguragui’s parents Hajiba and Abdul told a sentence hearing for their son’s killer that they wanted to do something good for their communities when they moved to Ireland and are proud of what their children have achieved.
But in an emotional statement Hajiba asked why her “kind” son was taken from her in an argument over a bicycle, “something cheap”. She said she wants justice for her son.
Abdul said that his son’s killer was caught on CCTV celebrating and “high-fiving” with friends after the fatal attack.
He added: “In addition to losing my son in a heinous crime I also lost myself, my wife and two kids as we have never been the same.”
Mr Justice Paul McDermott will pass sentence later today.
The 17-year-old defendant, who cannot be identified because he is a minor, was found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter by a jury in September. He had previously offered to plead guilty but the Director of Public Prosecutions rejected the plea.
The victim, Azzam Raguragui (18), died after suffering five stab wounds during a melee in Finsbury Park, Dundrum, Dublin 14 on 10 May 2019.

Dee Ryan, chief executive of Limerick Chamber, said businesses are “very anxious” to re-open their doors as soon as possible.
“We will have to get the doors open before Christmas. We’re just going to have to do this,” she said.
Many retailers are planning to re-open in early December, once the current Level 5 restrictions are set to be lifted.
“They have their stock; their team members, largely speaking, are anticipating and preparing to go back to work. But it’s a matter of how long the window to trade in in the run-up to Christmas will be,” Ryan told TheJournal.ie. 
A slight increase in Covid-19 cases over the past number of days has caused some concern among health officials, with Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan warning that people ignoring guidelines are “putting progress at risk”.
Ryan said the increase in case numbers is “concerning” and has heightened the anxiety felt by many retailers.
“If things keep going in the direction that we’re heading in right now, it has to put a question mark over how open we’re going to be.”
Ryan said the uncertainty brought on by the pandemic has been very stressful for retailers.
“They want to be productive, they want to be contributing. They’re used to dealing with people on a daily basis, they thrive on that interaction, so it’s very difficult for all of them.
People are feeling quite low, they’re anxious to get trading.
Ryan said many businesses have ramped up, or created, an online presence in recent months in a bid to keep trading. She encouraged people to shop locally when buying Christmas presents.
“This year, in particular, it’s more important than ever to look to spend money with a local business owner and keep the spend within the local economy.”
Retail Ireland, the Ibec group that represents the retail sector, has called on the government to unwind the restrictions on retail trading in advance of December so retailers can trade safely over the coming weeks.
Director Arnold Dillon said: “A short three-week shopping window in December will create significant additional challenges for retailers working to manage numbers in stores and reduce the need for queues.
“Public health is the priority and retailers are taking extra steps to ensure a safe Christmas for customers. Many stores are looking at extending opening hours so that trade can be spread more evenly across the day.”
Dillon last week said the run-up to Christmas is “make or break for many retailers” who are “relying on the period to make up for the major financial hit taken earlier in the year”.
‘Ridiculous’
Brian Foley, of the Vintners Federation of Ireland (VFI), said publicans also need to know in advance of 1 December, when Level 5 restrictions are due to end, if they can open next month.
“We need clarity as soon as possible. Pubs need to know – they have a whole re-opening plan that they need to implement, they need to get in touch with the suppliers to get stock in, get staff back, there is a whole host of issues that need to be tackled to get open, so leaving it until the day before it’s just ridiculous.
“We’ve seen that throughout the year that that doesn’t work. So, you know, basic level of respect will dictate that the government let pubs and their staff know know as soon as possible, well before the end of lockdown.”

Socialising, funerals and people 'taking their eye off the ball': Concerns over uptick in Covid cases
Foley told TheJournal.ie that pubs need to be allowed trade indoors “in a safe, socially-distant manner” in order for re-opening to be viable.
Before the current Level 5 restrictions, the country was in Level 3, under which pubs and restaurants could remain open for takeaway and delivery, and outdoor dining or service to an maximum of 15 people.
Wet pubs in Dublin – those that don’t serve food – remained closed. By 1 December, Dublin pubs that do not serve food will be closed for 260 consecutive days.
The country is expected to return to Level 3 next month. However, outdoor service limited to up to 15 people is “useless” for many pubs, Foley said.
“It’s not something that would work for our members, so we want indoor indoor trading in a safe, socially-distant manner”.
The VFI, which has 4,000 members outside Dublin, wants all pubs, including those that don’t serve food, to be allowed re-open next month. The Licensed Vintners Association (LVA), which represent pubs in Dublin, is also calling for the re-opening of all pubs in a safe manner.
Takeaway pints
Earlier today Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said he was “extremely annoyed and concerned” by videos of large crowds gathered in Dublin and Cork over the weekend.
Martin told Cork’s RedFM the government will consider changing the law on takeaway drinks. He said he would be speaking with the Minister for Justice on the matter and will also be seeking advice from An Garda Síochána.
Footage emerged at the weekend of a large number of people on South William Street in Dublin city, and also in Cork city – some of whom were drinking takeaway pints.
Pubs and licensed premises are legally permitted to sell alcohol for takeaway or to be consumed off the premises, but the alcohol cannot be consumed within 100 metres.

Foley said some people who are drinking outdoors are getting alcohol from off licences, rather than pubs. He said any pubs that break guidelines should be “dealt with”, but added that “the vast majority of publicans are following the guidelines”.
Drinks Ireland, which represents drinks suppliers and manufacturers across the country, also said that pubs should be given the opportunity to re-open safely at the start of December.
Patricia Callan, director of Drinks Ireland, today said pubs should be allowed to re-open once they follow the guidelines.
“The December trading period will be a final lifeline for many pubs, who are ready and able to welcome customers back.”
Callan noted that the hospitality and wider experience sector employs 330,000 people, and will likely play a crucial role in the eocnomic recovering post-pandemic.
“In the longer-term, the sector can play a crucial role in the economic recovery which will follow this pandemic, as it did during the recovery of the last economic crisis, when it accounted for one in every seven jobs created,” she added.","The Vintners Federation of Ireland said outdoor-only service is “useless” for many pubs.",26,0,0,25332,"Nov 16th 2020, 1:30 PM"

Purple House Cancer Support Centre, based in Co Wicklow, said calls to its helpline service from patients seeking food parcels have spiked since the onset of the pandemic.
The charity has received almost 3,000 calls to its helpline and provided 1,600 meals to cancer patients since March of this year and it expects those figures to continue to rise as Christmas approaches.
Purple House founder Veronica O’Leary said a cancer diagnosis can have a negative impact on a patient’s finances at any time but layered with the impact of Covid-19 it can have a devastating effect on the financial wellbeing of the patient and their immediate family.
She said they had noticed a significant increase in callers seeking mental health support services such as counselling to deal with the anxiety associated with coronavirus.
“When Covid-19 arrived on our shores, we immediately went into crisis mode to ensure that cancer patients were supported. However, there are many aspects, the hidden risks of cancer during a pandemic that have been truly harrowing,” she said.
Basic survival fears for people who are sick; the fear of the risk of going to the supermarket to feed your family; the increase in anxiety over delayed appointments when time is vital and the worries of children who are living with cancer.
“All of these issues paired with the fear of poverty added to the increase in demand on our services such as counselling, mental health support programmes, hospital transport, services for children and more.”
In addition to meals and taking calls from cancer patients, the charity has also held more than 1,800 cancer support sessions and provided some 350 chemotherapy transport trips to patients.
O’Leary said that in order to continue to fund the vital work of the Purple House helpline in the run-up to the Christmas period, and as many fundraising efforts have been cancelled; the charity has produced a book called The Music Of What Happens as part of their Christmas appeal.
Katie Boylan, who was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2017 aged 35, is one of the contributors.
“I still remember the first time I rang the Purple House; I was crying so much I couldn’t get the words out,” she said.
“The girl on the end of the phone was so lovely and caring and encouraged me to call in one morning to meet the counsellor Eimear and I could learn more about the services they offer.

“From the minute I walked through the door I was met with empathy and understanding but also everyone was so warm and friendly.”
Since then she has had counselling, acupuncture, reiki and attended their relaxation classes, during and after treatment, as well as joining the creative writing group.

Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said the government will be reviewing the selling of takeaway pints from pubs due to a number of instances of people congregating in defiance of public health guidelines.
Martin said he would be speaking with the Minister for Justice on the matter and will also be seeking advice from An Garda Síochána.
The Taoiseach’s comments comes as videos of people gathering on Dublin’s South William Street and Cork’s Patrick Street and Coal Quay were shared online and generated news coverage.

Pubs and licensed premises are legally permitted to sell alcohol for takeaway or to be consumed off the premises, but the alcohol cannot be consumed within 100 metres.
Drinking outdoors is not prohibited in general but many city and county councils have bye-laws that forbid drinking in some or all public places.
Some publicans not offering takeaway alcohol have complained that regulations are not being observed and that it is encouraging large numbers of people to congregate.
Speaking this morning on the Neil Prendeville Show on Red FM, Martin said he is “extremely concerned and annoyed” about reports of people drinking on the streets.
“I think it flies in the face of what’s acceptable in terms of adherence to the guidelines under the regulations because we all have to work to try and get the incidence of the virus down,” he said.
The Taoiseach said that “widespread congregation facilitates the spreading of the virus” and that the government is going to “look very seriously” at stopping the selling of takeaway alcohol.

“We’re going to have to review the whole takeaway pints and alcohol phenomenon  and we’re going to review it to see what we can do,” he said.
It would potentially mean a change of regulation so I’m going to consult with my government colleagues first before I make any announcement but we’re certainly going to review it.

October was “the biggest month for grocery sales since the height of the previous lockdown in June”,  according to Emer Healy, a retail analyst with Kantar.
“It all feels a far cry from August, when restrictions on eating and drinking out were eased, and the average monthly grocery bill was €200 lower,” she added.

Meanwhile, online grocery sales have continued to grow across the board, increasing 90% year-on-year in October. 
Healy added, “Online grocery continues to set new records, with almost 255,000 of us shopping through digital channels in October. 
“New converts to online grocery contributed an additional €30.8 million to the market in the past month as tighter restrictions were introduced. Shoppers also increased the size of their digital trolleys by 9.6%.”

“This positive interim analysis from our Phase 3 study has given us the first clinical validation that our vaccine can prevent Covid-19 disease, including severe disease,” said Stephane Bancel, Moderna’s CEO.
According to Moderna, there have been 95 cases of Covid-19 confirmed in the trial, with 90 of those observed in the placebo group. There were 11 severe cases of the disease, with all 11 found in the placebo group. 
The company said the vaccine was “generally well tolerated” and the majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Severe events included pain at the injection site, fatigue, myalgia (muscle pain), arthralgia (joint pain), headache and redness at the injection site. These adverse events were “short lived” according to a statement.
More than 7,000 Americans over the age of 65 were included in the trial and it also included more than 5,000 people under the age of 65 who have high risk chronic conditions such as diabetes, severe obesity and cardiac disease.
The vaccine is one of ten at the Phase 3 clinical stage. It requires two doses and is a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine. This approach does not expose the immune system to the actual virus but can still cause the immune system to produce antibodies against it.
The news follows an announcement from Pfizer and BioNTech – also an mRNA vaccine – last week that  results from their vaccine trial so far show it is 90% effective.
Modern also announced today that its vaccine can remain stable at standard refrigerator temperatures of 2 degrees Celsius to 8 degrees Celsius for 30 days. The company added it could be kept in long-term storage at standard freezer temperatures of -20 degrees Celsius for up to six months.

Pfizer’s vaccine, on the other hand, needs to be stored in deep-freezer conditions of -70 degrees Celsius which could complicate supply chain logistics, particularly in less developed countries.
On the downside, Moderna’s vaccine has about three times more genetic material per dose than its Pfizer counterpart, Zoltan Kis, a research associate at Imperial College’s Future Vaccine Manufacturing Hub, said. This would raise production costs and make it harder to scale-up.
Moderna intends to submit for emergency use authorisation with the US Food and Drug Administration in the coming weeks. It also said it plans to submit applications for authorisations to global regulatory agencies.
The European Commission has concluded successful exploratory talks with Moderna and President Ursula con der Leyen today said she hoped an agreement with the company would be finalised soon.
By the end of 2020, the company said it expects to have approximately 20 million doses ready to ship in the US and it remains on track to manufacture 500 million to one billion doses globally in 2021.

“We must not allow our success to date let us drop our guard against the spread of this disease,” he said.
But while NPHET may have hoped this reminder was a blip and nothing more,  a further 456 cases and six deaths were reported on Saturday. This daily case total compared to the previous two Saturdays where 335 and 416 cases were confirmed. 
The increase prompted Holohan into more serious commentary, noting that the five-day rolling average was now increasing once more and NPHET was now “concerned”.
“Analysis of today’s data shows the five-day moving average of case numbers has increased from 354 to 392. We have seen higher numbers in recent days than we expected based on the encouraging trends of the last three weeks. We are concerned that this progress is at risk. We have to remember that the virus is still very active in the community and we cannot let our guard slip,” he said. 
Yesterday NPHET then reported 378 new cases of Covid-19, a figure lower than the previous two days but still on the upper end of the increased five-day average. 
The figures prompted Holohan into saying that the increase in cases had “persisted for days”. This time however the CMO referenced two specific concerns, people gathering socially and for funerals.  
Holohan had also mentioned funerals as being an issue last Thursday, noting that NPHET has seen reports of “wakes and other gatherings as well as the church part of funerals”.

His comments about socialising also came as video clips of people gathering on the streets in Dublin and Cork on Saturday evening were shared online and generated news coverage. 
“The average daily five-day case count is rising and is now over 400 per day. This is a worrying development which has persisted for the last few days. We are seeing a number of things which concern us,” he said yesterday.
There are examples of small numbers of people congregating for social purposes and simply ignoring the important public health messages. They are putting our collective progress at risk. 
“We are also seeing a number of outbreaks across the country. These include outbreaks in association with funerals. We understand that this is a difficult time for families but it is really important that we do everything we can to avoid the circumstances which promote transmission of the virus.”
The CMO also reiterated that people should work from home.
“There have also been outbreaks associated with workplace settings. As we head into a new working week, we need to stay at home other than for essential reasons and for personal exercise within 5km. Anyone who can work from home, should work from home.”

Complacency
With Holohan making specific reference to socialising and funerals as a potential source of outbreaks, NPHETs Dr Mary Favier today RTÉ’s Morning Ireland today that there has been a complacency about people’s adherence to guidelines.
“I think cases have been rising in the last number of days because I think there’s a certain both complacency and fatigue,” she said. 
I think we’ve all thought we’re patting ourselves on the back should have done quite well. But I think there’s been a fraying around the edges. And we’ve seen cases where it’s social congregations out on the streets, whether it’s in workplaces, whether it’s around funerals. I think people are taking their own eye off the ball.
Favier also spoke about the upcoming Christmas period, saying that she has a particular concern about “how alcohol is used over the next few weeks” and the potential for people to “let down their guard”.
Speaking yesterday, Dr Gabriel Scally also said that “our experience with alcohol on Covid-19 is not a happy experience” and that we needed to be “extremely cautious” before considering whether pubs could reopen. 
Speaking about the recent uptick in cases, Scally said Ireland is doing well compared to most of Europe but that the second wave has proven difficult to fight.
“I think the second wave has been much worse than most people have predicted in many countries, and is proving slightly more stubborn in terms of getting the numbers down,” he said.
“But I think that’s because many countries have left too late to act. I don’t think Ireland did. I think it’s come down very well in Ireland and everyone is to be congratulated for it. And I think NPHET have called it absolutely right along the way.”","Chief Medical Officer Dr. Tony Holohan has said it is “a worrying development”.",126,0,0,43875,"Nov 16th 2020, 11:07 AM"

Trump is trying to convince the people that they should not believe the numbers that clearly demonstrate his rival’s win.
Rather, he is making baseless claims of massive fraud, demanding recounts and calling for audits in an effort to discredit the outcome and, in the process, put democracy itself on trial.
Obama, who invited Trump to the White House soon after his election win four years ago and pledged co-operation in the transfer of power, said he is not shocked that a man who “never admits loss” is refusing to acknowledge defeat now.
“I’m more troubled by the fact that other Republican officials, who clearly know better, are going along with this, are humouring him in this fashion,” Obama told CBS show 60 Minutes.
“It is one more step in delegitimising not just the incoming Biden administration but democracy generally. And that’s a dangerous path.”

Obama’s comments come after Trump appeared to accidentally acknowledge Biden’s victory in a tweet yesterday morning, before quickly reversing course to claim he won, and again push unsubstantiated claims of mass electoral fraud.
“He won because the Election was Rigged,” Trump tweeted.
The first two words – coming days after a verbal slip in which Trump said “time will tell” if he remains president – were immediately seized upon as one more step towards a concession.

But the president soon made a U-turn, tweeting: “He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go.”
And last night he said “I WON THE ELECTION!” in a tweet swiftly flagged by Twitter.
President-elect Biden captured 306 Electoral College votes in the 3 November election – 36 more than needed to win the White House.

656,249,"Working but no workers' rights: the plight of the PhD revealed",https://www.thejournal.ie/academic-uncertainty-pt3-5265677-Nov2020/,"“LOW STIPENDS AND unpaid teaching have left PhDs in a position where they should feel grateful to have any funding at all which isn’t fair.” 
Laura Murphy is a PhD student in Trinity and part of the PhD Workers Rights Group who are campaigning for workers rights for PhD students across Ireland.  
Murphy said that this “prevalent attitude” in higher education institutions (HEIs) is as a result of the lack of funding available. Low levels of funding for universities after the crash in 2008 meant that they “became creative”, according to the PhD researcher.  
The funding bodies and Department of Higher Education need to understand the toll this is having on PhD students, explained Murphy. “With the cost of living rising, it’s going to become harder and harder for people to do PhDs unless they’re from a more privileged background and can afford to do it.” 
Murphy said this is not only having an impact on the mental health and financial stability of early career researchers but also can lead to diminishing the research outputs and the benefits to the economy due to the “increasing amount of time put into working other jobs [in order] to afford the PhD”.  
She is in receipt of one of the “higher stipends” and has done both unpaid teaching in her department as well as paid teaching in another department to “get enough money to live in Dublin”.
Laura Murphy, TCD, is calling for workers rights for postgraduate researchers
Source: Laura Murphy
Noteworthy has spent the last six months gathering the experiences of academics and researchers working in third-level institutions.
Yesterday, part one revealed that short-term contracts and instability of employment are rife across the sector and part two explored how precarious work is having an impact on diversity in HEIs. Today, we delve into ongoing campaigns by postgraduate researchers for workers rights. 
Most of the problems that the PhD Workers Rights Group have encountered centre around “the fact PhDs don’t have a liveable wage” which, according to Murphy, became a big issue at the height of the housing and rental crisis. She said this is because, though rents have increased in recent years, some PhD stipends have remained static.  
For instance, Noteworthy has a copy of an advertisement from 2007 for a funded PhD in the Institute of Neuroscience at Trinity College Dublin with a stipend of €18,000 per annum. This month, the same institute advertised for a PhD position with an annual stipend of €18,500, a 3% increase in over more than a decade.  
When the issues of payment of PhDs for teaching and stipend funding was put to a spokesperson for the university, they did not answer this query.  
‘Issues solved’ with workers’ rights 
Stipends are tax-free payments that PhD students receive, normally paid on a monthly basis from the HEI they are based in. PhD scholarships and funding vary between HEIs and funding bodies, though some students complete a PhD with just a fee waiver from the institution or no funding at all.  
The most recent Irish Research Council Postgraduate Scholarship Programme 2020 offered a stipend of €16,000 per annum as well as a contribution to fees and research expenses. The Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) policy on budget allocation states that it funds student stipends “at a flat rate of €18,500 per annum for up to four years”. 
PhD stipends vary not only within institutions but also between HEIs. Stipends awarded as part of Trinity’s scholarships range from €13,000 to €20,000 per year. Waterford IT launched a number of scholarships last year which awarded a stipend of €12,000.  
During the course of this investigation, Noteworthy also spoke to a PhD student on an IT scholarship of less than €10,000 per year which, as a mature student with a family, they had to supplement with work outside of their research and unpaid teaching contribution of three hours per week.  
Taking the Irish Research Council stipend of €16,000, this equates to just over €1,300 per month or €300 per week. If PhD researchers work a 40-hour week, this is €7.70 per hour. The current minimum wage is €10.10 per hour and the living wage is €12.30. However, these figures are normally not used in the context of PhD students as they are not classed as workers in Ireland.  
Source: Noteworthy/Flourish
In addition to an increase in stipends, Murphy said that postgraduate researchers have raised a number of other issues and they “quickly realised that all of these would be solved with workers’ rights”, explained Murphy. “That’s not a brand new idea as there are countries in Europe where PhDs are not considered students, they are workers.”  
This is the case in Sweden where “PhD students are treated like full employees” with a “salary and other standard benefits of employment”, according to Stockholm University’s website.  
In the Swedish system, PhD students are hired for four years of full-time employment and the salary increases as you progress. At Stockholm University, this starts at €2,575 (SEK 26,500) and increases up to €2,850 (SEK 29,300) per month.  
That is a salary range of €31,000 to €34,000, which is approximately €24,500 to €27,000 after tax, when inputted into a Swedish tax calculator.  
In Mercer’s 2020 Cost of Living Survey which included rental accommodation costs, Dublin ranked 46th and was the most expensive city in the eurozone. In comparison, Stockholm ranked 133th of the 200 cities surveyed, so is a significantly cheaper city to live in, yet PhD students receive more income on a monthly basis. 
Action over unpaid teaching  
There are a number of other groups that have recently started campaigning on this issue. Postgraduate researchers in NUI Galway are also campaigning to be recognised as workers and to be paid for the annual 120 hours teaching contribution they are normally expected to undertake at the university. 
In September, they sent a letter to the President of NUI Galway as well as the Minister for Higher Education and Research, Simon Harris, which stated: “The arrangements whereby postgraduates carry out teaching or related academic duties is exploitative and unjust during ‘normal’ times, and this unfairness is even more palpable given postgraduates are now expected to carry out these duties on the front lines of a global pandemic.” 
PhD students can now be “allocated alternate forms of teaching contribution” during Covid-19 if they are “not in a position to undertake an on-campus teaching contribution”, according to a notice on NUI Galway’s website.  
However, Shane O’Connell from the Postgraduate Workers Alliance in NUI Galway felt that unpaid teaching “is unethical”. Their “goal is to abolish the 120 hours of teaching contributions”. 
From a university perspective, he said “there have been nothing but working groups set up”. His expectations of anything coming out of these is low.  
On the NUI Galway website, under the heading ‘Why are we still not paying our postgraduate students for the contributions that they make to teaching?’, it states:  
Our research degree guidelines state [that] normally all PhD students make contributions of a maximum of 120 hours per year (approximately 5 hours per week over 24 weeks) over three academic years, without extra payment… This is the norm for the sector.  
A spokesperson for the university said that this guideline “has been in place since prior to the recession”. They added that the university “recently established a working group on ‘Contract Research Staff: Employment and Career Progression’ that is tasked with reviewing representation of research staff, amongst other issues, on committees”. 
We also put to NUI Galway that PhD researchers are calling to be paid for these hours and asked if they intend to pay them for this in the future or work with the Postgraduate Workers Alliance on these issues. The university did not answer this query.  
The hourly rate for tutorials in NUI Galway on the lowest point of the scale is €24.36, according to their ‘Hourly Paid Teaching Staff Timesheet’ so five hours equates to €121.80 per week. This equates to almost €2,923.20 worth of work per PhD student per year, dependent on the amount of preparation time included in the allotted hours. 
O’Connell, who has PhD funding from a new SFI Centre for Research Training, said that although he feels very supported in his Department, his experience of unpaid teaching “hasn’t been good at all”.  
Last year, during his first year of his PhD he put together tutorials for a module from scratch and spent a lot more than 120 hours on this work. “I basically didn’t get any research done for a good two months.” He also knows of other people who gave lectures which required a “massive amount of preparation”.  
Action being considered by the alliance, according to O’Connell, are striking or refusing to carry out unpaid teaching.  
In a response to a parliamentary question on this issue by RISE TD Paul Murphy at the start of October, Minister Harris said “the management of their academic affairs, including the delivery of their courses are matters for the individual institutions” but “encouraged both sides to engage to resolve this matter”. Harris continued:  
“Contributing to teaching is an integral part of the training of a research Master’s or PhD student. Teaching contribution assists in the acquisition of generic and transferable skills, as described in the National Framework for Doctoral Education and in the PhD Graduate Skills Statement from the Irish Universities Association.” 
Up to six hours teaching in some HEIs 
Through freedom of information (FOI) requests, we asked every university and institutes of technology (IT) for the number of PhD students teaching, supervising or conducting other activities such as tutorials with no monetary compensation or as part of a condition of their PhD funding.  
The full breakdown of information we obtained via FOI, is available here:  
Source: Noteworthy/Flourish
Click here to view this searchable table in a different window.  
Athlone IT has a requirement of “two hours tutoring (per week) as part of their monthly stipend”, with any additional hours paid. An AIT spokesperson cited a survey from 2019 which found that 71% of postgraduates taught, with 67% agreeing that this enhanced their experience.  
GMIT and Waterford IT have similar policies to AIT, linked to scholarships or fee waivers. As does Limerick IT but a spokesperson said that “it is not a common practice at LIT for teaching or supervision to be conducted without monetary compensation”. 
TU Dublin was the only university that provided any data to Noteworthy on this part of our FOI request, with the City campus stating that PhD scholarship funding did not have a condition of teaching or supervising.  
A spokesperson for DCU said that “there are no records” because “PhD students are not categorised as staff”. A similar answer was given, through FOI, by the remaining other universities.

We followed up with these HEIs through press requests. DCU and UL had similar policies, with exceptions for certain students. DCU puts “a cap of six hours per week in a semester” for substantial scholarship recipients, while in Limerick “up to six unpaid contact hours per week” may be required.  
No further information was provided by Trinity College, NUI Galway and UCD. Maynooth University and UCC both said they have PhD students engaged in teaching but no expected hours were specified to Noteworthy.  
Problems caused by ‘unclear relationship’
One issue that faces PhDs is the fact that since they are not recognised as workers in Ireland, unions have no power to negotiate or collectively bargain with HEIs on their behalf. SIPTU’s education sector organiser Karl Byrne explained that this was because “the Employment Rights Act is dependent on you being an employee” but PhD researchers are classed as students in Ireland.  
However, SIPTU has been supporting them over the past year through the Union of Students in Ireland (USI), according to Byrne. He said it is important as PhD students are at the “bottom of the precarity pyramid – where it all starts”.  
As mentioned in part one of this investigation, universities are developing a Researcher Careers and Employment Framework which has been lauded as addressing some of these researcher employment issues. This will be published before the end of the year, according to the Irish Universities Association (IUA) who represent all universities in Ireland, except TU Dublin. 
When Noteworthy asked the Department of Education about the ongoing campaigns by PhDs in universities across Ireland, a spokesperson said that “PhD students, in addition to conducting research, participate in other activities to develop generic and transferable skills”. They added:  
“In circumstances where issues arise relating to teaching duties of postgraduate students… all parties should engage constructively in the interest of securing balanced solutions.” 
TCD’s Murphy wants unions to get behind PhD researchers to recognise that they deserve workers’ rights. “The point is that we don’t want to be viewed as students. We deserve to be viewed as workers.” 
For now, she said the PhD Workers Right Group in Trinity are talking to the group in NUI Galway as well as another in UCD. They want to “agree on a set of national demands to have a unified approach” which she hopes will happen in the New Year.

Evacuations were being conducted from low-lying areas in Nicaragua and Honduras near their shared border, which appeared to be Iota’s likely landfall.
Winds and rain were already being felt on the Nicaraguan coast last night.
Iota became a hurricane early yesterday and rapidly gained power, and was expected to pass over or near Colombia’s Providencia island during the night.
It became a dangerous Category 3 hurricane early today, and the US National Hurricane Centre warned it would probably reach Category 4 strength as it approached the Central America mainland later today.
The hurricane centre said Iota had maximum sustained winds of 125mph this morning.
It was centred about 190 miles east-southeast of Cabo Gracias a Dios on the Nicaragua-Honduras border and moving westward at 10mph.
It was already a record-breaking system, being the 30th named storm of this year’s extraordinarily busy Atlantic hurricane season.
Such activity has focused attention on climate change, which scientists say is causing wetter, stronger and more destructive storms.

In Honduras, compulsory evacuations began before the weekend and by Sunday evening 63,500 people were reported to be in 379 shelters just in the northern region, while the whole country was on high alert.
Nicaraguan officials said that by late yesterday afternoon about 1,500 people, nearly half of them children, had been evacuated from low-lying areas in the country’s northeast, including all the inhabitants of Cayo Misquitos.
Authorities said 83,000 people in that region were in danger.
Wind and rain were beginning to be felt last night in Bilwi, a coastal Nicaraguan city where people crowded markets and hardware stores during the day in search of plastic sheeting, nails and other materials to reinforce their homes, just as they did when Hurricane Eta hit on 3 November.
Several residents of Bilwi expressed concern that their homes would not stand up to Iota, so soon after Eta.
Local television showed people being evacuated in wooden boats, carrying young children as well as dogs and chickens.

Authorities warned that the risk was high because Iota would probably come ashore over areas where Eta’s torrential rains left the soil saturated with water and more prone to new landslides and floods.
Eta already wreaked havoc. It hit Nicaragua as a Category 4 hurricane, killing at least 120 people as torrential rains caused flash floods and mudslides in parts of Central America and Mexico.
Then it meandered across Cuba, the Florida Keys and around the Gulf of Mexico before slogging ashore again near Cedar Key, Florida, and dashing across Florida and the Carolinas.
Iota was forecast to drop 8 to 16 inches of rain in northern Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and southern Belize, with as much as 30 inches in isolated spots.
Costa Rica and Panama could also experience heavy rain and possible flooding, the hurricane centre said.
Eta was the 28th named storm of this year’s hurricane season, tying the 2005 record for named storms. Theta, the 29th, was far out in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, and became a remnant low on Sunday.

Meanwhile, a sudden cluster of virus cases has been detected in South Australia after seven months without a significant outbreak.
In the US, the dizzying rise came as cities and states across the country were implementing new restrictions to try to halt the spread of the virus, with stay-at-home orders set to be imposed in Chicago today.
The US crossed the 10 million case threshold on 9 November,
As of 1.30am yesterday — just six days later — the Johns Hopkins University real-time tracker showed that the confirmed US caseload stood at 11,025,046.
There have been 246,108 deaths in the country — both are the highest tolls in absolute terms in the world.
The US has seen a worrying surge in coronavirus cases since the start of November, forcing local and state officials from coast to coast to take more drastic steps to reduce the disease’s spread, with many hospitals already warning that they are running out of resources.
In addition to the stay-at-home orders in Chicago, the country’s third-biggest city, its biggest — New York, the epicentre of the country’s spring outbreak — is also rushing to fend off a second wave with new restrictions on bars and restaurants.
New York schools will remain open today, even though New York City mayor Bill de Blasio had warned that they could switch to fully remote learning by then.
President Donald Trump promised last Friday that the first Americans would start receiving a vaccine in “a matter of weeks”.
However, he said he remained firmly against new lockdowns.
Further complicating matters is Trump’s refusal to cooperate in the shift to President-elect Joe Biden’s administration, denying the Democrat both federal funding for transition work and vital briefings by outgoing officials.
Democrats and Biden’s chief of staff say this could have a damaging impact on his ability to face the mounting challenges posed by the pandemic once he assumes office.
Biden and his team currently are not even allowed to consult with experts like top government immunologist Anthony Fauci, who is still a part of the White House Covid-19 task force.
“Of course it would be better” if such talks could begin, Fauci told CNN on Sunday, noting that the virus could kill tens of thousands more Americans by the time Biden takes office on January 20.
‘Powerful cluster’
A sudden coronavirus cluster has emerged in the Australian city of Adelaide today after seven months without a significant outbreak there, with the virus again escaping from the country’s hotel quarantine system.
South Australia state reported four cases had been detected in the city on Sunday, before the cluster grew sharply overnight to 17 people — the largest there since April.
All but two of the 17 were members of the same large family, including one who was working in a hotel used to quarantine travellers returning from overseas.
Fearful of case numbers spiralling, authorities snapped back a swathe of coronavirus restrictions and suspended international flights into Adelaide.
“No effort will be spared to slow and stop the spread of the powerful cluster,” South Australia state Premier Steven Marshall told a press conference.
Officials ordered hundreds of people to isolate while closing linked schools and businesses.

South Australia residents are being urged to wear masks, work from home and avoid non-essential travel.
The Adelaide cases also prompted other states to immediately impose new restrictions on anyone travelling from South Australia. 
The country’s internal borders had been gradually reopening and were due to be almost fully reopened by Christmas.
South Australia last detected a Covid-19 cluster outside border quarantine in August, when health authorities swiftly prevented the small handful of cases from spreading using similar measures.
But there are fears the latest outbreak has the potential to infect high-risk populations, with a prison guard and aged-care workers reportedly among those testing positive.
It comes just as Australians were breathing a collective sigh of relief after squashing a second-wave outbreak in Melbourne that originated from security bungles at hotel quarantine.
Melbourne, which recorded thousands of cases and hundreds of deaths in recent months, has now gone more than two weeks without a single new case.
Overall, Australia has been relatively successful in containing the virus, with just over 27,700 cases and 907 deaths recorded since the pandemic began.

On Chorus is a public art project by sound artist Christopher Steenson. The project will use Irish Rail’s train station PA systems to play the sound of birdsong from 8am to 9am until 29 November.
The project highlights the dramatic reduction in noise pollution in Ireland during the first Covid-19 lockdown in Ireland.
During this time, the sounds of towns and cities across Ireland were filled with the clear and uninterrupted sound of birdsong, which provided a stark contrast to the sounds of cars, planes and other machinery that usually consume our urban soundscapes.
The sounds played on Iarnród Éireann’s PA systems was recorded by Steenson during the first few weeks of lockdown, in inner-city Dublin last Spring.
On Chorus uses birdsong as a vehicle for highlighting the biodiversity of urban environments, emphasising the rich variety of wildlife that exists in town and cities, which can go unnoticed amongst the noisy commotion of our daily lives.
At the same time that birdsong will be heard in train stations, birdsong will also play on the website created especially for the project.
The website will provide information about the project, as well as presenting a series of 35mm photographs created by Christopher Steenson.

“Birdsong is something that is very dear to my heart,” said Niall Hatch, head of development and communications with BirdWatch Ireland,
“Throughout Covid-19 restrictions, it became even more important to me, as I know it did to people all across the country,” he said.
“Hearing the sound of the birds singing around my home, and especially the beauty of the dawn chorus, became a real source both of entertainment and of comfort to thousands of people, many of whom had never really paid it much heed before.”","The project highlights the dramatic reduction in noise pollution in Ireland during the first Covid-19 lockdown.",24,0,0,25276,"Nov 16th 2020, 7:53 AM"

Merino, 59, stepped down shortly after a crisis session of Congress called on him to quit power before 6pm (11pm Irish time) or face censure.
“I want to let the whole country know that I’m resigning,” Merino said in a televised address, a day after a police crackdown on protesters left at least two people dead.
Congress failed to agree on a new president in a vote last night. Leftist legislator and former human rights activist Rocio Silva Santisteban, supposedly a consensus candidate, needed 60 votes but she only got 42, with 52 against and 25 abstentions.
“Congress had in its hands the solution to this political crisis that they generated. However, today they have turned their backs on the country,” former economy minister Vizcarra Maria Antonieta Alva tweeted.
Party whips then held a closed-door meeting as thousands of protesters remained peacefully on the streets, undisturbed by police.
Thousands have taken to the streets in days of protests against Merino following the ouster of his predecessor Martin Vizcarra, who was impeached by Congress on corruption allegations on Monday.
Elections are scheduled for April 2021 and Merino was scheduled to leave power in July, when Vizcarra’s mandate was to end.
The Congress ultimatum came after the health ministry said two protesters were killed on Saturday during a massive and peaceful march in Lima, which was repressed by police firing shotgun pellets and tear gas.
Merino said that to avoid a “power vacuum” the 18 ministers he swore in on Thursday would temporarily remain in their posts, though almost all had resigned in the wake of Saturday’s crackdown on protests.
His resignation was greeted by noisy celebrations in Lima, with demonstrators taking to the streets sounding horns and banging pots.
“We succeeded. Do you realize what we are capable of doing?” Peru national soccer team midfielder Renato Tapia wrote on social media.
Some lawmakers questioned the wisdom of removing Vizcarra in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic and a crippling recession.
The pandemic has hit Peru hard, with the politically fragile country having the world’s highest per capita death rate with nearly 35,000 fatalities, and GDP plunging over 30% in the second quarter.

Police criticised
Vizcarra, 57, welcomed his rival’s resignation, having questioned the legality of his dismissal last week.
“A dictatorship has left the palace,” he told reporters outside his home in Lima, adding that Merino “was breaking our democracy”.
The popular former president did not rule out a return to his mandate and urged an early ruling on a constitutional challenge to his 9 November dismissal.
“It is essential that the Constitutional Court make a statement urgently and say whether what the congressmen did on the 9th is legal,” said Vizcarra.

Thousands of mostly young protesters took to the streets Saturday to oppose what they called a parliamentary coup against Vizcarra.
A crackdown by police left at least two dead and 94 injured, according to health ministry officials. But the National Human Rights Coordinator said 112 were injured and warned that a dozen had also “disappeared” during the protests.
The violent repression of the protests eroded whatever political support Merino had and the head of Congress called for his immediate resignation.
The police tactics have been criticised by the UN and rights organizations such as Amnesty International since the protests began on Tuesday.
The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights regretted the deaths of the two protesters and demanded “an immediate investigation of the facts and to establish responsibility”.
Vizcarra had broad support since succeeding Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, the former Wall Street banker who was forced to resign under threat of impeachment over corruption allegations in 2018.
Congress impeached and dismissed Vizcarra on Monday over allegations he took kickbacks from developers when he was governor of the Moquegua region in 2014, charges he denies.

SPACEX HAS LAUNCHED four astronauts to the International Space Station on the first fully fledged taxi flight for Nasa by a private company.
The Falcon rocket thundered into the night from Kennedy Space Centre carrying the second crew to be launched by SpaceX.
The Dragon capsule on top – named Resilience by its crew in light of this year’s many challenges, most notably Covid-19 – is due to reach the space station early tomorrow and remain there until spring.
Nasa astronauts Shannon Walker, Victor Glover and Michael Hopkins, and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Soichi Noguchi, took off at 12.27am today.
Sidelined by the virus himself, SpaceX founder and chief executive Elon Musk was forced to monitor the action from afar having tweeted he “most likely” had a moderate case of Covid-19.
The flight to the space station – 27.5 hours door to door – should be entirely automated, although the crew can take control if needed.

US Vice President Mike Pence, chairman of the National Space Council, travelled from Washington to watch the launch.

The four astronauts will be joining two Russians and one American who flew to the space station last month from Kazakhstan.
The space station soared over the launch site a mere half-minute before liftoff.
The first-stage booster is expected to be recycled by SpaceX for the next crew launch.
That is currently targeted for the end of March, which would set up the newly launched astronauts for a return to Earth in April.","The flight to the space station – 27.5 hours door to door – should be entirely automated.",7,0,0,13678,"Nov 16th 2020, 7:13 AM"

Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney made the announcement to mark a “virtual visit” to Dublin by the mayors of Greater Manchester and the Liverpool City region, Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram.
Coveney said the new diplomatic presence would further his government’s objective of developing Irish-British relations post-Brexit.
Ireland already has an embassy in London and consulates general in Edinburgh and Cardiff.
It is hoped the new consulate general will open in the first half of next year. In 2019, state business support agency Enterprise Ireland opened an office in Manchester.
“Moving ahead with plans for a new consulate in the north of England is a really strong signal of Ireland’s commitment to the Irish-British relationship,” said Coveney.
“When opened, this new consulate general at the heart of the north of England will upgrade our capacity to advance our commercial interests and our cultural and people-to-people links.
“I am especially delighted to be making this announcement today as the Tánaiste and I prepare to welcome a virtual visit from Andy Burnham, Mayor of Greater Manchester, and Steve Rotheram, Mayor of the Liverpool City Region.
“Enhancing our collaboration with regional and local government in Britain will be a big part of our work to deepen Irish-British links.
“We look forward to a valuable exchange with Mayors Burnham and Rotheram today, who between them represent areas with a combined population of 4.3 million people and with deep historic links to Ireland”.

666,250,"Extract: Manchán Magan on the the controversy around the Irish word leprechaun",https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/manchan-mangan-book-history-irish-language-5202581-Nov2020/,"IN HIS LATEST book, the author and broadcaster Manchán Magan explores the Irish language – in particular, the lost words of the Irish language. He spent six years researching the book, which shows how the Irish language has wonderfully evocative ways of describing the world around us. Here, in a chapter on Fairy Words,  he looks at the leprechaun. We’re revisiting this extract as the book has been nominated in the Best Irish Published Book of the Year category (sponsored by TheJournal.ie) at the An Post Irish Book Awards. 
Perhaps the form of fairy that has caused the most controversy is the leprechaun.
It’s a sensitive issue for Irish people, because of the way it was handled in 19th-century English and American journals and most particularly in the Disney film Darby O’Gill and the Little People (1959).
Its depiction of leprechauns came to be used to mock Irish people and was later commodified to help sell legions of tacky souvenirs.
But Walt Disney in fact based the depiction of leprechauns on reports compiled by the Irish Government documenting people’s attitude to the spirit folk.
It was a national research project called the Schools Manuscripts Collection that ran for 18 months from 1937 and produced more than half a million pages of material that was gathered by 100,000 children from their grandparents, grand-uncles and grand-aunts, as well as from older members of the community.
The collection contains more than 375 accounts of leprechauns, from practically every county, ranging from 39 in rural Co. Cork to a single one in Co. Louth. It can therefore hardly be considered culturally insensitive to refer to leprechauns or to our past belief in them.
To take two examples, there’s an account in the collection by Patrick Donoghue, a farmer from Raharney, Co. Westmeath, who was 85 in 1937.
At a bridge called the ‘wild cats bridge’ about two miles from the village of Raharney a leprecaun is seen playing a bagpipes at the bridge every night at twelve o clock. At the other side of the road it is said that there is a pot of gold buried and a turkey hen left to mind it.
For Donoghue, this was just a piece of local knowledge. It was a fact, just as how we are now told to believe that the molecules in a table are constantly moving, even though most of us will never see this with our own eyes. Donoghue went on to say that John Kellet of Raharney “is supposed to have caught a leipreachan. He asked him to give him the gold.
He said he would and then he said to John that his wife was calling to him and when John turned round the leipreachan went away.”
His neighbour Pat Farrelly, a former labourer, remembered a time when Tommy Scally “was spreading manure and while he was doing so a leipreachan appeared and walked around the cart looking at it. The man, who had never seen such a thing before, fainted and had to be carried off. A few weeks after he was out in the field again and the leipreachan appeared. The man caught him by the shoulder but he disappeared out of his hands.”
These are just two among hundreds of tales of encounters with leprechauns, which still exert a certain influence on the language and are frequently referred to in place names.
The word derives from lúchorpán, a small body, but the varieties of it make it clear that leprechauns never had a single, easily definable character.
The most common term is gréasaí leipreachán (a little-bodied cobbler), but one can also find references to lutharacán, lorgadán, lúracán, lochradán, lochramán, loimreachán, loiridín, luadhacán, luiricín, lúiridín, lutharadán, lutharagán and luacharmán. Each word was indigenous to an area. Lutharacán, lorgadán and lúracán are from the Iveragh Peninsula, the Limerick–Tipperary border and the region around Kilkenny and South Wexford, respectively.
Other versions have strayed further from the base version, such as clutharacán, which is found only in a remote area bordering West Cork and East Kerry; geacánach was used from South Ulster down through the stretch of Leinster north of the River Boyne. On the Aran island of Inis Meáin the word lioprachán is used, while just across the water in Cois Fharraige and Carna the same word means a baby bird.
The leprechauns in each area shared the characteristic of being small, and almost all carried with them an inexhaustible fairy purse, which could be yours if you could catch hold of one of the creatures. They were like the lottery, always offering the outside chance of unimaginable wealth.

Other leprechauns, with slightly different traits, had other names. In the Hiberno-English of Co. Fermanagh a gankeenock (from geancáneach, ‘fairy cobbler’) was a typical leprechaun, while a lockreeman (from lochramán, ‘puny creature’) was bigger than a fairy but smaller than a typical person. West Limerick had lutharagáns, clutharacáns and lorgadáns. The first of these referred to a run-of-mill leprechaun, while the second and third were used for smaller and heavier-set ones, respectively. The Blasket Island poet Mícheál Ó Gaoithín, son of Peig Sayers, referred to loprachán, lochargán, lotharagán, lopracháinín and lochargáinín all within the span of a single story.
Leprechauns have always been part of my Irish-language life in West Kerry, though in my English-language life in Dublin they were confined to films and storybooks. When I was about seven, while digging in the garden between Muiríoch and Baile na nGall, I found an old dúidín, a short-stemmed clay pipe, with its stem broken off.
Most pipes like these are from the mid-19th century to the early 20th century, and they can be dated accurately by means of the design stamped on them. Mine was stamped IRISH TRADES ASSOCIATION, which dates it to about 1870, but when I showed it to an elderly neighbour, Maidhc Idá, he insisted it was a pipín lutharagáin, a leprechaun’s pipe.
He said it with such conviction – and the pipe looked so ancient and otherworldly – that I had no cause to doubt him. It was he who told me that the pig nuts I had dug up beneath ash trees were prátaí lutharagáin (‘leprechaun potatoes’) and he had said it in such a way that I never thought to question it. I accepted it as a fact, just as he did, for after all we weren’t far from the lios (‘fairy fort’) where my mother is sure she saw a leprechaun when she was a girl.
She was an only child with a vivid imagination and no cousins or friends nearby to play with, so I can readily believe her.

Leo Varadkar said any scheme must protect low paid and vulnerable workers as well as being fair and affordable for businesses.
Varadkar’s comments came as he launched a public consultation on the government’s plans for new laws to give employees the legal right to sick pay.
The consultation will be open from today to 18 December.
“Ireland is one of only a small number of European countries in which there is no legal obligation on employers to provide for sick pay, in the way they do annual leave for example,” he said.
“This needs to change and I am committed to introducing a statutory sick pay scheme that works for employees and employers as quickly as possible.”
Varadkar, who is minister for enterprise, trade and employment, said while many employers do provide for sick pay, there was no provision in law compelling them to do so.
He said the result was many low-paid and vulnerable workers being left exposed when they become unwell.
The government has said it will enact statutory sick pay legislation in Ireland by the end of 2021.
Varadkar acknowledged it had been a difficult year for employers, having had to contend with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and looming prospect of Brexit.
“The scheme must be designed so that it protects employees, particularly low paid and vulnerable workers, but it also needs to be fair and affordable for employers, many of whom have faced great difficulties this year,” he said.

Commenting on the launch of the consultation, Patricia King, general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, said that Ireland is “completely out of line with European norms” in relation to sick pay.
“It took a pandemic to expose the big failings in how we protect workers against loss of income, the lack of a legal entitlement to sick pay from an employer being one of the most glaring examples.
“Unlike workers in nearly all European countries, workers in Ireland have no legal right to sick pay,” she said.
“Sick pay is at the discretion of the employer to include or not in a contract of employment. As a result, up to half of the labour force, including hundreds of thousands of low-paid essential workers, don’t receive sick pay and face being financially compelled to work when unwell.”
ICTU Social Policy Officer, Dr Laura Bambrick added, “Our voluntary system of sick pay isn’t working.

Johnson’s bid to reframe his tenure as Prime Minister was left in limbo after his meeting with Tory MP Lee Anderson who has since tested positive for Covid-19.
The Prime Minister, who was admitted to intensive care with coronavirus in April, said he was notified by NHS Test and Trace yesterday that he must self-isolate.
“I have no symptoms, but am following the rules and will be working from No10 as I continue to lead the government’s pandemic response,” he said.
The news comes at a politically sensitive time for the Prime Minister after the sudden exit from Downing Street of his senior adviser Dominic Cummings and communications director Lee Cain.
Downing Street had insisted Johnson would present a committed policy launch on social justice, “levelling up” and coronavirus over the coming weeks.
The move was being seen by some at Westminster as a bid by the Prime Minister to show he was still in control of the government’s agenda.
But as the announcement was made, Johnson was advised to self-isolate after attending a 35-minute meeting with a small group of MPs in Downing Street on Thursday morning.
Anderson, MP for Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, said on Facebook he lost his sense of taste on Friday and, after being tested on Saturday, received a positive result yesterday morning.
The two men were not wearing face coverings and did not appear to be two metres apart in a photo taken at Downing Street which Anderson posted on Facebook.
Number 10 said the “critical announcements” due over the coming weeks would send a “clear signal of his ongoing ambitions for the United Kingdom” with the Prime Minister expected to outline plans for dealing with issues like the Covid-19 pandemic and social inequality.
It was reported on Twitter that Johnson is expected to continue to make public statements from inside No 10, including on the government’s green plans.
This is also a pivotal week for Brexit, as negotiations with the EU reach their final phase.
Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme this morning, Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney described the news as “a minor distraction”.
“But from an EU perspective, we’ve always been focused on the issues, not the personalities. And what I mean by that is, the EU negotiating mandate is crystal clear and hasn’t changed.
“Whether it was Prime Minister Theresa May or Prime Minister Boris Johnson, while the style has changed significantly, the EU still wants to try to achieve the same thing, which is fair competition, a trade agreement that avoids tariffs and quotas, a future relationship that creates a positive partnership between the EU and the UK into the future, the implementation of the protocol in Northern Ireland to protect peace to avoid border infrastructure on the islands,” he said.

Hybrid arrangements
Downing Street said Johnson will liaise with parliamentary authorities about remote participation in House of Commons proceedings. Under the “hybrid” parliament arrangements, MPs can only take part in some proceedings by video link.
Asked if Johnson would be able to take part remotely in Commons events, such as Prime Minister’s Question Time on Wednesday, a Number 10 spokesperson told the PA news agency: “I think that’s what they are trying to work through.”
It was reported Johnson told Tory MPs in a WhatsApp group message that “the rules are the rules” and he must self-isolate as advised although he feels “fine” and his “body is bursting with antibodies from the last time I had it”.
Johnson tested positive for Covid-19 at the end of March and was admitted to a London NHS hospital on 5 April, which Downing Street said was a “precautionary step” as his symptoms persisted.
He then spent three nights in an intensive care unit, later revealing it “could have gone either way” and thanked NHS staff for saving his life.","The situation comes as the Prime Minister wants to move forward on Covid, education, and environmental issues.",5,0,0,34776,"Nov 16th 2020, 6:30 AM"

Kiely watched his team retain their Munster senior title today but says he is ‘quite offended’ that ten players on the full Limerick senior panel were not allowed to be present.
The GAA is operating under the Government’s protocols for elite sports which only allowed for those on the 26-man panel to be at matches.
“We’ve 10 players at home, which in my view is completely and utterly unacceptable, given that I’ve 20 reporters standing in front of me and I’ve 10 of my panel at home. I’m quite offended by that situation we’ve been put in.
“I would appeal to the authorities at government level, at national level, to end this nonsense and allow the panels across all the county teams to be together. Because that unity that’s involved with 36 players is crucial. Our players should not be at home when we’ve 200 plus people in a stadium watching the match. Our players should be here, with their colleageus. As far as I’m concerned that cup won’t be presented until Tuesday night and we get to training with our full panel of players.
“That is a government decision I’m told. But listen, whoever is making the decision I disagree with it.”

Given the number of people present in Semple Stadium for media, stewarding and other purposes as the game took place, Kiely does not believe there is a greater risk in allowing all of their players to attend matches.
“I don’t agree with the premise that we can have 200 plus people in the stadium, which were here today watching this match, when my ten players are at home this morning.
“Training number one in order to keep their load up to the equivalent level to ensure that if they do get called up next week they don’t get injured because their load isn’t right. So that to me is just not acceptable because I don’t believe there is an inherent risk to ten of those players coming with the rest of the group, in their own car like the rest of the group, siting in the stand, watching the match and being a part of our group after we’re finished.

“They brought a ferocious intensity to it. brought a really crowded middle third. Were very direct in their running. The support runners that they had were coming off the shoulder constantly. They’re a fine team. We knew that back in February, knew it in March. I’ve been saying it all week. We were expecting a really, really difficult challenge and it came exactly that way.
“I’m just delighted our boys stood up to the challenge and kept their composure and ironed out the result maybe on a day when they didn’t play at their very, very best.
“But you’re not going to play your best every single day you go out but you’ve got to still find a way of winning. And I’m delighted with the way our lads kept their heads, kept their composure and worked so so hard in that final quarter to see out the game.”

We’re asking readers to keep a record of how much they earn, how much they save if anything, and what they spend their money on over the course of one week.
Each money diary is submitted by readers just like you. When reading and commenting, bear in mind that their situation will not be relatable for everyone, it is simply an account of a week in their shoes.
If you’d like to document your spending, or lack thereof and any lifestyle changes during this Covid-19 period, we’d love to hear from you. Send an email to money@thejournal.ie and we’ll be in touch.
Last time around, we heard from a 22-year-old software engineer on €45K living in his parents’ house. This week, a 22-year-old HR professional living and renting in Dublin and saving for a mortgage.
I am a 22-year-old HR professional living and working in South Dublin. I started my public sector job about six months ago, having recently graduated from college.
I am currently renting a house with three other people close to work, which is great as it means I have no commuting costs. The past few months have seen a big change in my spending.
As this is my first full-time job, it is also my first time living (mostly) independently, which means I have to keep track of my money more than ever.
Despite having a small enough salary and a few large expenses such as a car loan, I manage to save about €1,000 a month. I am ideally saving to be able to get a mortgage someday, but that is a long way off yet.
I am lucky that I have always been in the habit of saving money, so it’s practically automatic for me these days to put money aside each month in my savings account. My short-term goal is just to have €10,000 saved by the end of the year.
In my spare time before Covid, I would often meet up with friends or my boyfriend, but at the moment with the Covid restrictions, I mostly spend my downtime watching Netflix or going for a run.

Monday
6.50 am: My alarm rings at 6.30 but I can’t drag myself up until now. I’m running late now – oops. I have breakfast which is always the same during the week – cereal and tea while I scroll through social media.
7.40 am: I leave for work slightly later than I usually would but my commute is only a 20-minute walk so I have plenty of time. I listen to music and eat a banana as I walk.
8.00 am: I sit down at my desk and catch up with a colleague who has been off work for two weeks then start to go through my emails. There’s always loads after the weekend but I only have a couple this morning (thank God).
10.15 am: I take my morning break in the kitchen with a colleague from a different office. I eat some rice cakes and drink a cup of tea like always.
10.35 am: My afternoon is very busy today but I’m alone in my office for the day so I can work away without distractions.
1.00 pm: Lunchtime. I have soup in the kitchen and end up spilling half of it taking it out of the microwave – typical Monday.
2.00 pm: Busy again for the afternoon.
4.30 pm: I leave work right on time today because I’ve had enough of Monday. When I arrive home and go to put out some washing, I find that my housemate has done it for me – fantastic! I get started on dinner instead.
5.30 pm: While my risotto cooks I prepare tomorrow’s lunch and stick on Friends in the background (does it ever get old? I must have seen it all 10 times at this stage).
7.00 pm: After some guilt-inducing emails from Duo the Owl, I decide to do some Duolingo. I’m teaching myself Dutch because I’m fluent in German and the two languages are really similar. I also try to keep up my Irish using the app but I’m not very good at doing it regularly. 
8.00 pm: I pick out my outfit for work tomorrow and get all of my stuff ready. I always do this before bed so that I’m not rushing in the mornings.
9.15 pm: Time for Netflix in bed, and then I call my boyfriend for a while. We don’t get to see each other a lot as he lives in a different county (especially with the latest restrictions) so we call each other most nights.
10.30 pm: I go to sleep fairly late for me – usually I’m asleep shortly after 10.
                                         Today’s total: €0.00
Tuesday
6.35 am: I actually manage to get up more or less on time today. It can take a while to get ready in the morning because our house has four girls all getting ready for work at the same time, so I like to try and get up early. I get ready and have my usual breakfast.
7.30 am: Out the door to work, stopping on the way to pick up some milk for the kitchen in the office (€0.75)
10.00 am: Myself and a friend from the department go for a coffee in the canteen. She only works once a week so it’s really nice to have a catch-up with her on Tuesdays. As tea and coffee have been free in the canteen since the start of the pandemic, I pay nothing.
1.00 pm: Lunch is spent in the kitchen with some colleagues. I love having our own kitchen in the office because lots of people come in and out during lunch so it’s a great excuse to chat with people who don’t share an office with me. At a distance, of course.
2.00 pm: We have a filing project for the afternoon so I have a welcome distraction from my usual work. I love my job, but at the moment things are moving quite slowly meaning I spend a lot of time checking up on things and following up with people.
5.10 pm: I arrive home from work and my alarm goes off, reminding me that this month’s car loan repayment is due today. I quickly log in to my Credit Union online banking to see that €150.00 has been transferred to my mother, who lent me the money for my car back in June. 
5.25 pm: Stretch and off out for a run on the beach. I run 5km and then hop in the shower.
7.00 pm: Leftover risotto for dinner as I watch some Netflix. I decide to check my bank account and see that €12.99 has come out of my account for my phone bill. The rest of the evening is spent relaxing and getting myself ready for work tomorrow, before heading off to sleep at around 10 pm.
                                                 Today’s total: €163.74
Wednesday
6.25 am: I wake up a few minutes before my alarm and check the weather for the day from bed. 4 degrees – not good.
6.45 am: I finally get up, get ready for work and make my breakfast. Then it’s out the door to walk to work. I have my usual banana as I walk.
8.00 am: Arrive at work and start for the day.
10.10 am: I break for tea and rice cakes. Work isn’t too busy today compared to the last 2 days. I chat with some colleagues while I have my tea. Then I go back to my desk and back to work. I get a lot of work done for a project I’ve been working on which I’m happy about.
1.00 pm: I take my lunch break with a few colleagues. I have a sandwich, fruit, and crisps that I prepared last night. I nearly always bring my lunch with me as I find it saves money and helps me to eat healthier.
2.00 pm: I head back to my desk with a cup of tea. I do lots of filing for the afternoon, which is boring but it gets me away from my desk for a bit.
4.30 pm: I leave the office and head for the bus stop. I am visiting my great aunt this evening, as she lives alone and I am her social bubble. I top up my LeapCard by €5.00 and hop on the bus.
5.25 pm: Traffic was heavier than expected considering we are in a lockdown, and it takes me a while to get to my aunt’s. We have some socially distanced dinner and a gin, while we catch each other up on news.
8.45 pm: My aunt was good enough to give me a lift home so that I don’t have to wait out for the bus in the cold. I get home and, after picking out an outfit for work tomorrow, I get ready for bed.
9.00 pm: My boyfriend and I have a Skype call for about an hour. 
10.15 pm: Off to sleep.
                                  Today’s total: €5.00
Thursday
6.30 am: My alarm goes off but I don’t get up until 6.45 am. I’m finding it harder and harder to get up with the dark and cold mornings.

8.00 am: I arrive at work. It’s warmer today so by the time I get there I’m regretting my hat and gloves.
10.25 am: Break time – tea and rice cakes again. It’s been a slow morning with lots of emailing to do so I’m glad to give my head a break. I catch up on the US Election news from yesterday in the kitchen. I’m not particularly invested but it’s all that seems to be on Twitter the last few days.
1.00 pm: I go across the road to the supermarket to buy lunch today. I buy a sandwich, crisps, and a DairyMilk to keep me going in the afternoon (€5.11). I usually buy myself lunch once a week as a treat. My Revolut balance drops a bit low so I top it up by €15.00. I always keep a small amount of money in my Revolut account for small purchases, as my bank card doesn’t have contactless and my Revolut does.
2.00 pm: Back to my desk with my tea and chocolate.
4.40 pm: I leave work and stop into Tesco on the way home for cereal and milk for the morning (€3.34).
5.10 pm: I get home, get changed, and have a quick stretch before heading out again for a run. One of my wireless earphones dies soon after leaving which is annoying but I keep going.
5.50 pm: I run 4km and then hop in the shower.
6.30 pm: My Dad calls me on his way home from work so we chat for a few minutes about work, then I go downstairs to make tonight’s dinner, and lunch for the morning.
7.30 pm: Dinner is a simple tuna pasta but it ends up taking ages to make it because of a row I have with the tin opener. I eventually head up to my bedroom to eat it while watching Top Gear on Netflix.
8.30 pm: I get my things ready for the morning, and then spend the rest of the evening watching more Netflix.
10.15 pm: I fall asleep very early again.
                              Today’s total: €8.45
Friday
6.45 am: I drag myself out of bed, get dressed, and head downstairs for breakfast. The cereal I bought yesterday is disgusting but I have nothing else so I eat it anyway.
7.55 am: I arrive at the office and notice that it’s very quiet. Lots of people are back to work from home since the latest lockdown, and nearly everyone wants their Friday at home. I don’t work from home just yet, as the work I do is very paper-based and usually requires a lot of consulting with other people. 
8.30 am: My manager brings in croissants and sweets for the team because it’s Friday and it’s been a hectic week!
10.00 am: Break time again. There’s no milk left in the kitchen so I have to steal some almond milk from someone.
10.20 am: I work away for the rest of the morning. My workload has been light the past few days while I wait for some documents to be processed so I take on some extra work from some colleagues who are busy.
1.00 pm: I have my lunch alone today (sandwich, crisps, and an apple again) as so many people are out of the office. I spend my time watching TikToks (so so addictive).
2.00 pm: The rest of the afternoon is actually quite busy compared to this morning. I get some of the documents I was waiting on back so I can move the process along, and that keeps me busy.
4.10 pm: I head out the door a few minutes late because I wanted to tie up a few things before the weekend. I call my Mam and then my boyfriend as I walk home.
4.30 pm: I stop in Spar for a bottle of wine (€9.99). I’m treating myself to wine and Chinese this evening as I received word this week that I’m getting promoted! I’m sad I can’t go home to celebrate but unfortunately, restrictions won’t allow it.
5.00 pm: I order a spice bag and satay sauce from the Chinese. The total is €12.80 including delivery. Then I make a shopping list for tomorrow’s grocery shopping and do some Duolingo. I watch Netflix with a glass of wine while I wait for my Chinese.
5.45 pm: The Chinese arrives and I sit down to enjoy. My sister texts me to look under my car for a parcel so I go out and find she has sent me a bottle of wine and some chocolate to congratulate me on my promotion – such a nice surprise!!
9.00 pm: I Skype my boyfriend for about 45 minutes before heading off to sleep. I go to sleep very early on a Friday too because I’m usually wrecked after the week of early starts. This week the glass of wine has me extra sleepy so it’s not long before I’m asleep.
                                       Today’s total: €22.79
Saturday
8.00 am: I wake up early and scroll through socials. I very rarely achieve a proper lie-in at the weekends – I’m just an early riser. But this is a lie-in compared to 6.30 am.

9.30 am: I finally get up and make tea and toast, which I eat while watching Top Gear on Netflix again. I don’t really know anything about cars but I really enjoy watching it.
10.15 am: I put on makeup before heading out for my grocery shopping. I wouldn’t usually bother wearing makeup at the weekends but there’s not much better to do during a lockdown, and I so rarely get to dress up anymore.
11.10 am: I go to Aldi for my shopping. The total comes to €25.63 plus €2 for multi-storey parking.
12.30 pm: Put away the shopping, and then have a ham sandwich and crisps for lunch. I watch an episode of Grey’s Anatomy. I’ve only just started the series and I’m really enjoying it so far even though some of the surgery scenes freak me out a bit.
2.30 pm: My afternoon is spent cleaning. I do most of the deep cleaning around the house – my housemates just don’t seem to be bothered. I don’t mind really though because I actually enjoy it.
3.50 pm: Time for a cleaning break with some tea and chocolate, and yet another episode of Grey’s Anatomy.
5.20 pm: I decide to stay the night with my social bubble as one of my housemates is working nights. I drive over this evening rather than getting the bus, and pass through the M50 toll but luckily my car is registered to my mother‘s E-Flow account.
7.30 pm: After catching up on each other’s news, my great aunt and I have dinner (duck and orange sauce – yum!), and I finish the rest of my wine from last night.
10.00 pm: As we’re both wrecked, we have an early night. As usual, I catch up on social media before turning off my light.

Sunday
9.00 am: I wake up feeling very well-rested. The beds in my aunt’s house are a lot comfier than my own. We have no major plans for the day so I lie in bed on social media for a while.
10.00 am: Up and off for my run. I only run 2.5km today but as it’s a Sunday I don’t feel like pushing myself.
12.30 pm: It’s a really nice day today so I get out of the house again to go for a walk in the Botanic Gardens. 
1.00 pm: Dinner today is roast lamb which we have very early but we’re from the country so it’s a habit I suppose. We have apple tart for dessert and then relax for the evening.
4.45 pm: I hop onto the M50 off home. Again, the toll goes onto Mam’s account.
5.30 pm: I start to get a bit hungry so I walk to the shop near my house. My Revolut balance has dropped low again so I top it up by €15.00 and buy a frozen pizza which costs €2.50.
6.00 pm: While waiting for my pizza to cook I get myself ready for the morning and do some housework.
6.10 pm: I see that an Irish blogger is holding a fundraiser for Crumlin and Temple Street Children’s Hospitals so I donate €11.50 to that.
7.15 pm: Yet again, I call my boyfriend on Skype to catch up on his weekend.
9.00 pm: I’m A Celebrity is coming back next week which I’m very excited about, so I watch a programme about that on Virgin Media before going to sleep early.
                                    Today’s total: €14.00
Weekly subtotal: €241.61
What I learned –
I think I am doing well to save so much per month considering my salary, and I will hopefully get to save even more when I move into my new role in a few weeks and my salary increases to €28,749. As I don’t expect to have any extra expense in the next few months, all of the extra money will go to savings.
I realise I am very lucky that my parents have supported me so much, from loaning me the money for my car to paying for my college fees so that I could save all I earned.
I am also lucky that my Spotify and Leap Card costs are still on a student rate as I have only just graduated. I’m not sure if I’ll bother continuing to pay for Spotify when the fee goes up next year. 
I am definitely a creature of habit, and probably spend a bit too much time watching Netflix. That being said, there’s not a whole lot else to do while in lockdown, and I’m usually doing something slightly more productive while it’s on, such as cleaning.
This was definitely a “treat yoself” kind of week due to my promotion. I wouldn’t usually drink or eat so much but I felt I deserved it.","This week, our reader details how she’s staying fit and keeping her spending under control as she works hard during the Covid-19 pandemic.",2,0,2,89082,"Nov 15th 2020, 8:00 PM"

TOP-RANKED Dustin Johnson shook off an early stumble to win the Masters in record-breaking fashion on Sunday, capturing his second major title with the lowest total score in the tournament’s history.
The 36-year-old American, who grew up only an hour’s drive north of Augusta National, became the first reigning world number one to grab the green jacket since Tiger Woods in 2002.
Johnson, whose other major victory came at the 2016 US Open, fired a closing four-under-par 68 to finish on a 72-hole Masters record 20-under-par for a five-stroke triumph over South Korean Im Sung-jae and Australian Cameron Smith.
Johnson smashed the old 72-hole Masters mark of 18-under 270 set by Woods in 1997 and matched by Jordan Spieth in 2015.
Third-ranked American Justin Thomas was fourth on 276, one stroke ahead of fifth-ranked Rory McIlroy and South Africa’s Dylan Frittelli.
Johnson, who began with a four-shot edge, had never converted a 54-hole major lead into a title, stumbling at the 2010, 2015 and 2018 US Opens and in August’s PGA Championship, where he settled for a runner-up spot.
That hex ended Sunday, but not without some early drama as Johnson, runner-up in three of the past six majors including the 2019 Masters, saw his lead trimmed to one.
After curling in a 12-foot birdie putt at the par-4 third, Johnson made back-to-back bogeys at the fifth and par-3 sixth, ending a run of 33 bogey-free holes.
Im birdied the second and third to stand only one adrift on 14-under, but he faded with bogeys at the par-3 sixth and par-4 seventh.
- ‘Amazing ability’ -
Johnson responded with six-foot birdie putts at the sixth and par-5 eighth to reach 17-under, stretching his gap to three on Smith, four on Im.
Johnson was unflappable from there with deadly accuracy and consistency.
He sank a 12-footer for birdie at the par-5 13th and a six-footer to birdie the 14th to reach 19-under, seizing a five-shot edge with four holes remaining.
“DJ has just an amazing ability to stay calm in tough moments,” Woods said. There’s no one more suited to that, I think, than DJ.”
Johnson sank a five-foot putt at the par-3 16th and parred in for his 24th career PGA title, his four bogeys on the week the fewest of any Masters champion.

Im was trying to become the first Masters debut winner since 1979 and only the second male Asian major winner after compatriot Yang Yong-eun captured the 2009 PGA Championship.
Smith, a 27-year-old from Brisbane chasing his first major crown, closed on 69 and settled for becoming the first player in Masters history to shoot all four rounds in the 60s.
Four-time major winner Rory McIlroy, needing a green jacket to complete a career Grand Slam, went three-under on the front nine but made bogey on 10 and never threatened Johnson.
- Woods horror show -
McIlroy, unable to recover from a first-round 75, took some solace after a sixth failed attempt to complete the career Slam.
“I didn’t have a great start but over the last 54 holes, only two bogeys, a lot of great golf in there,” McIlroy said. “Not overthinking it as much could be the key for me.”
Defending champion Woods found Rae’s Creek three times on his way to a septuple-bogey 10 at the par-3 12th, his worst score ever on a major hole. He responded with birdies on five of the last six holes to close on 76 and finish on 287.
“Hit a few too many shots than I wanted,” Woods said. “Had a lot more experiences there in Rae’s Creek.”
The 15-time major winner, a five-time Masters champion, matched his best Augusta start with a 68 but back pain doomed his bid for a sixth green jacket.
Germany’s Bernhard Langer, a two-time Masters champion and at 63 the oldest player to make any Masters cut, fired a 71 to finish on 285.
That was one stroke better than US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, who closed on 73, never coming close to overpowering Augusta National as some feared. He struggled with dizziness, testing negative Friday for Covid-19.
“I had some weird things happen to me I just couldn’t forsee,” DeChambeau said. “I’ve got to fix this dizziness or whatever is going on. I’ve got to get healthy first and foremost.”
American Andy Ogletree closed on 72 to finish as low amateur on 286.
There were no spectators to provide trademark Masters roars due to the Covid-19 pandemic that postponed the event from its usual April slot.

Three-year-old hen New Kim was the focus of a two-week auction and the final price was reached as the bidding came to an end on Sunday.
During a frantic last half-hour, two Chinese bidders operating under the pseudonyms of Super Duper and Hitman drove up the price by €280,000.
The final total left the previous record that Belgian-bred Armando fetched last year well behind by €350,000. Super Duper submitted the winning bid.
Successful breeder Gaston Van de Wouwer retired at 76 and his son had too busy a professional life to continue the famed pigeon coop.
All 445 birds were put on auction and the overall sale was closing in on five million euro (£4.48 million). A second part of the auction is ending on Monday but did not include any bird that could match New Kim.
Belgians have long stood out as the best breeders, both because of their generations-long experience and the density of a network where many breeders can organise races close together.
“Everybody is interested in our pigeons,” Pascal Bodengien, head of the Belgian pigeon federation, told The Associated Press.

“To be the best, it has to be your life’s work. For some, it may seem boring. Day in, day out. Winter and summer, always those pigeons.”
China often features one-loft racing, where pigeons all get used to one coop for months and then are released many hundreds of miles away to make their way back with their unique sense of orientation and special speed training.

THE WEEK THAT brought Donald Trump’s election defeat and a potentially game changing Covid-19 vaccine couldn’t deliver a goal for the Republic of Ireland. 
Instead it brought another Nations League defeat according to a grimly familiar pattern. Ireland were the better side for swathes of the game without carving out any real goalscoring chances and then conceded mid-way through the second half.

This is now deja vu happening all over again. Ireland twice lost 1-0 to Finland by conceding on minutes 63 and 66; tonight they lost to Wales to a goal on minute 65. 
It was scored by David Brooks from close range, the last touch of a piece of penalty area pinball after Wales switched up their system. It was an instant return on investment for the stand-in boss Robert Page, the kind Kenny is growing desperate for, as the positive signs in Ireland’s approach and attitude become lost beneath the din of bad results. 
Ireland are now winless in his seven games in charge, having scored just a single goal.
They host Bulgaria in Dublin on Wednesday needing a draw to avoid relegation, and more desperately need a goal to snap a scoreless run that has now stretched to six games, the worst run in Irish football history.
By the time they kick off against Bulgaria, Ireland will have gone exactly a year without scoring a competitive goal from open play. 
The now-typical clatter of injuries and unavailability forced Kenny into changes for this game, with Kevin Long brought in for John Egan at centre-back and Dara O’Shea shifting to left-back to allow Matt Doherty revert to the other flank. 
Robbie Brady and James McClean were introduced to the Irish attack and offered zip and   creativity. McClean won an early free-kick which Brady whipped to the back post, at which Shane Duffy threw himself but made minimal contact. 
The two then combined for the only shot on target of the first half, as Brady chipped a ball over the top of the Welsh defence onto which McClean latched before shooting at Ward from a narrow angle. It was an ambitious effort at the end of a clever diagonal run by McClean; the type of movement his manager has been asking for. 
Earlier, Brady himself sent a shot whistling over the bar after Neco Williams contorted himself to cut out a Daryl Horgan cross to McClean. 
Wales, meanwhile, were doing their familiarly average turn, and were struggling to involve Bale. Their best chance of the half came when Bale finally got a sight of goal, when he sent a long-range free whipping and dipping through the air before clipping the top of Darren Randolph’s crossbar. 
Ireland left for half-time the better side and with a sense of grievance: Wales midfielder Joe Morrell was booked rather than sent off for a kicking out at Jayson Molumby, who himself was shown a yellow card that rules him out of Wednesday’s game with Bulgaria.
Kenny’s main complaint from the Wembley plight was Ireland’s passivity, but that charge couldn’t be levelled at them here. They snapped into tackle and hogged the ball, but, yet again, struggled to mint these intangibles. 
Stand-in Wales boss Robert Page reacted to the strong Irish start by changing his system, introducing striker Kiefer Moore and switching to a 4-2-3-1.

It soon made a difference. A cross from Dan James on the right flank was flicked over his own head by the retreating Duffy, but Bale – relocated to the left-wing – jumped high above Matt Doherty with spring-loaded calves to head the ball back across the box where David Brooks diverted it in from all of a yard out.

Kenny reacted by withdrawing Molumby and Idah for Hourihane and Collins, and the latter showed his intent by shooting with his first touch. Albeit tamely, and from distance. Collins then drew a foul from Williams on the edge of the box…that ended with Randolph denying Brooks a second goal.
Brady’s ball into the penalty area was cleared 40 yards to Jeff Hendrick, who inexplicably decided to shoot first time. It was blocked, Hendrick then made a hames of controlling the ball when it came back at him, and Brooks sprinted clear only to be denied one-on-one by the Irish goalkeeper.
Kenny then made his final play, hooking O’Shea and Brady for Callum O’Dowda and Jack Byrne, the latter becoming the first League of Ireland player to appear in a competitive Irish international since 1985. 
Byrne found himself some space within minutes of his introduction and slipped the ball through for Collins, who again shot first time. Albeit again tamely, and again from distance.
Ireland ended the game utterly ragged, and substitute Kiefer Moore might have added a second in injury time had he not shot lamely at Randolph.
The night got worse, again cleaving to a familiar sight as Ireland finished with 10 men against Wales for the second-straight game as Jeff Hendrick slid in as the last man and fouled Tyler Roberts. 
He will miss the Bulgaria game now too, which has become a game freighted with exactly the wrong kind of meaning.

677,249,"'Doing the housework of academia': Women and minorities hardest hit by third-level working conditions",https://www.thejournal.ie/academic-uncertainty-pt2-5265743-Nov2020/,"“WOMEN WHO GO into academia get trapped in exploitative forms of precarious work in the sector and for longer periods.” 
That is according to Dr Theresa O’Keefe, sociology lecturer in UCC whose research has found that many were stuck in these jobs for 10 or more years “with few exit points into secure work”.  
Her research papers, written with Dr Aline Courtois, focus on people stuck in a ‘hamster wheel’ of insecure work in Ireland.  
There is a gender divide when it comes to secure work in the sector with almost 60% of permanent full-time academic roles held by men. More women work in part-time temporary academic jobs with this gap increasing in recent years to 71% in universities and 63% in ITs in 2019. 
O’Keefe said this gap is hugely concerning. “The rhetoric that higher education institutions (HEIs) often use is that this flexibility suits women, because they have caring roles, so it’s not considered a problem.” She added that their studies found that women were trapped in these roles “not by their own choice”.  
Her research also highlights the fact that women are “typically given the bulk of the teaching and administrative work, which impedes their progress”. O’Keefe said “this is seen as the housework of the academy”. They are also less likely to co-publish research with their supervisors.  
Additional pressures such as childcare have already been shown to have a potential impact on women working in research during the first Covid-19 lockdown. An analysis conducted over the summer showed that female academics were publishing at a lower rate than their male peers during the months of March and April 2020 compared to the same months in 2019 or January and February this year.

Noteworthy has spent the last six months gathering the experiences of academics and researchers working in third-level institutions.
Earlier today, we revealed that short-term contracts and instability of employment are rife across the sector. This evening, we explore how precarious work is having an impact on diversity in HEIs.   
Low numbers with disabilities  
In addition to women being affected by barriers created by gender inequality, other diverse groups – such as people with disabilities or from minority or ethnic backgrounds – face obstacles when trying to find jobs or funding in the higher level sector.  
“There isn’t a culture or history of disabled people being involved in academia,” explained Vivian Rath, who is on the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) Disability Advisor Committee. 
He suggested that the reason the impact of precarious and temporary work on people with disabilities isn’t being raised at a national level is because figures for people with disabilities working in HEIs are so low.  
“My community is not progressing from undergraduates to postgraduates,” said Rath. He has just finished his PhD and said there are many additional barriers for people with disabilities who want to complete this training.  
In AHEAD’s latest report for the 2018/19 academic year across HEIs, it states that 7.1% of undergraduates had a disability but this dropped to just 2.4% of postgraduates.  
A major hurdle for people with disability is accessing funding, according to the advocate, who said this may not be flexible for those who may need extra time to complete their PhD or cannot undertake some expected activities. In Rath’s case, he found funding was an issue as he did his PhD over eight years. 
PhDs are expected to lecture, give tutorials, write papers as well as organise and go to conferences, he explained. “That’s a huge workload and can be extremely challenging.” 
To improve this, people in HEIs should be made comfortable in disclosing their disability and made aware of supports they can avail of, according to Rath. These supports include assistive technology, notetakers, academic support, sign language interpreters and transport.  
He added that some disabled people are “unsure about disclosing their disability as they’re afraid it might affect their potential for promotion or accessing jobs”. 
In part three of this investigation, we spoke to a number of postgraduate groups about their campaign to be recognised as workers.

The Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities requires public bodies to achieve a target of 3% of staff with disabilities and this is rising to 6% by January 2024.  
The latest Equality Report from TCD in 2017/18 states that “2.9% of Trinity staff have declared a disability”, adding “the true figure may be higher”. For 2019, NUI Galway reported there were 3.6% of staff with disabilities. In 2018, Maynooth University undertook a survey of staff and found that 7% stated they had a disability or health condition, with further responses saying they were unsure or would prefer not to say. 
Rath said it is great that so much is being done in terms of gender equality in HEIs, especially with 14 HEIs and 42 departments now holding Athena SWAN awards, which require HEIs to address issues on gender. However, Rath felt it would be better if other forms of diversity such as disability were also included as part of this work.  
Absence of data  
“The Athena SWAN charter is a framework that is used across the globe to support and transform gender equality in higher education and research,” according to the HEA. This charter was launched in Ireland five years ago and is the main framework used for action on diversity in the sector.  
Since 2016, the HEA has collected gender data from HEIs and published annual reports on the gender profile of staff. However, “the absence of systematic data” on other aspects of diversity in Ireland was highlighted in a report by the Royal Irish Academy (RIA) and the British Council in September.  
Following this, the HEA made it compulsory for HEIs to provide an annual breakdown of ethnic diversity, starting from December this year.  
“Up to now, this data has not been collected by HEIs for various reasons which can differ from institution to institution, often relating to privacy issues and the sensitivity of the data in question. For this reason, a national statement on the use of ethnicity categories in Irish Higher Education has been published and endorsed by HEIs.” 
Impact on migrants 
We attempted to gather some information on this aspect of diversity in HEIs by asking for the number of academic staff on visas for each of the past three academic years through freedom of information (FOI) requests. Some HEIs gave us figures for their entire staff as they had “no records held centrally” for academic staff alone.  
The number of academic staff on visas or work permits was in the single digits for most ITs and between 5% and 8% in universities that provided this data to Noteworthy. 
You can support the huge volume of additional work required over the past number of months because of time-consuming FOI requests by supporting the Noteworthy general fund or giving the gift of investigative journalism to a loved one this Christmas.
Of the ITs, Waterford IT had the highest amount with 23 staff on visas as of the 2019/20 academic year. 
Numbers were slightly higher across the board in the universities.  
UCD stated that 8% of academic staff were from outside the EU and UK last year which had increased from 6% over the previous two academic years. UCC had figures of 8% of all of their workers (248 staff on average) and NUI Galway had figures of around 5% (36 staff on average) over the past three years. 
A spokesperson from DCU said that “there are no records available on staff requiring visas”. They added that they had a total of 124 staff who required hosting agreements. Maynooth University stated that “64 non-EU nationals requiring work permits have been recruited since 2017”. Trinity College had 180 academics with non-EEA nationality as of May 2020.  
Difficulty in obtaining permanent work in higher level, as detailed in part one of our investigation, can be a problem for those applying for certain work permits in Ireland as job security is needed in order to obtain one. 
Dr Sinead Pembroke, a researcher in Trinity College, said that the growth in casualisation in third level had an impact on migrants she spoke to as part of a report she wrote, ‘Precarious work precarious lives’, for the Irish think-tank TASC last year. She said some people interviewed faced leaving Ireland as they could not get a permanent job.

Ilaina Khairulzaman, who completed a science degree and masters in Ireland, wrote about this issue and how it impacted her for Noteworthy last year.  
“Being from Malaysia, temporary and short-term contracts weren’t an option for me as I needed job security in order to apply for a work permit.” She found a job in Ireland before her two-year graduate visa expired but it was outside of the higher level sector.  
“This entire process was very stressful and a constant worry for two years. I only realised the effect it was having on me once I settled into my new job and a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders.” 
Taking leave is ‘challenging’  
Dr Susan Kathleen Fetics, co-director of Women in Research Ireland, also left academia but for a different reason – to save her “lifestyle and mental health”. She said that “you need to be working seven days a week as weekends are spent catching up on articles and writing grant proposals”.  
You are expected to publish, have funding, do community outreach, go to conferences, promote your work, network, mentor and be mentored, she explained. “The pressure that’s put on you from the culture of criticism and what needs to be accomplished – it’s never enough.”  
If you are trying to have a family on top of this with a short fixed-term contract, it makes it even more challenging. This is especially true, according to Fetics, if you need to take time off for maternity leave or childcare during a one- or two- year project. This can lead to your research “being scooped” by another group or missing out on funding opportunities.  
During the course of this investigation, we spoke to a number of women who highlighted this as a major issue for them and spoke about the struggles they had either when starting a family or caring for children while working in HEIs.  
One university researcher on a fixed-term contract said that because adequate cover was not provided over her maternity leave, she struggled to meet the targets required by the funding body on her return. Being on a fixed-term contract, she felt this affected her future prospects of employment.  
“It’s very hard to get hold of data about mothers in academia,” according to UCD lecturer Dr Enrica Maria Ferrara who wrote an article in June on the “enduring baby penalty”.  
Though there’s no official Irish data on this, Ferrara said “there’s no reason to believe that Ireland isn’t in line with the global trend that mothers are impacted very heavily”. 
The system of evaluation of academics needs to change to improve this, she said. It should be judged “not by quantity, but by quality”.  
Ferrara suggested that, for women with children, a defined length of time, such as two years, should be taken into account in job and funding applications for time lost while having children. That should include not only maternity leave, she explained, but also breastfeeding and childcare.  
This is currently the case for some funding bodies but not all. For example, you are eligible to apply for specific European Research Council (ERC) grants at certain times in your career. For the ‘Starting Grant’, researchers who finished their PhD from two to seven years ago can apply.  
If the applicant had a baby during this crucial five-year window, then they can add 18 months on for every child born. For example, this would allow those who had two children post-PhD to apply for this grant up to ten years after their PhD, instead of seven.  
Most lecturers and researchers that were on temporary or hourly-paid contracts who spoke to Noteworthy said a partner supported them financially. Without this support, some said their career would not have been possible. Even with a partner, many told us they struggled and were unable to get a mortgage or had to make other sacrifices due to lack of money, which ties in with Pembroke’s findings for TASC.  
Lack of paid leave
This year, due to the pandemic, issues with another type of leave – unpaid sick leave – were highlighted by workers on insecure contracts across many sectors in Ireland.  
The TASC report found that “many precarious workers do not get paid sick leave and therefore cannot afford to take time off work” which leads to “a triple financial burden associated with ill-health: unpaid sick leave, the general practitioner (GP) fee and the cost of medication or follow-up appointments”. 
O’Keefe is currently conducting new research on precarious work in HEIs and has found the lack of paid sick leave to be “the biggest fear” around the impact of Covid-19 on these workers.

A bill to give employees an entitlement to paid sick leave was put forward by Labour leader Alan Kelly in September but still has to go through the various stages of the Dáil and Seanad.  
Because of the pandemic, the Government introduced a Covid-19 enhanced illness benefit of €350 per week to people diagnosed with Covid or self-isolating. Budget 2021 also reduced the number of waiting days for the normal illness benefit – which is dependent on PRSI contributions – from six to three from the end of February next year. 
Sexual harassment ‘a concern’ 
In additional to impacts on finances, career progression and mental health, research from the UK and other sectors shows that women in precarious, low paid and exploitative work are also more likely to experience sexual harassment and violence in the workplace.   
There are no official Irish statistics on sexual harassment occurrence involving HEI staff but it was mentioned in the study from last year by O’Keefe and her research partner Courtois, where they surveyed people engaged in academic work and who identified as precarious in Ireland. They reported that a number of their female respondents “raised the issue of sexual harassment in the workplace as a concern”. 
“This is because this tends to be a transient workforce, hired for eight months on an hourly basis,” O’Keefe told Noteworthy. She added that the stigma and vulnerabilities associated with being precarious mean that people worry if they will be taken seriously. “It’s much easier to get rid of someone who’s precarious.” 
A spotlight was shone on the issue of sexual harassment in Ireland in higher level recently when broadcaster and UCD academic Dr Aoibhinn Ní Shúilleabháin spoke out about her “horrific” experience. It was revealed that she had been subjected to regular harassment by a professor at the university, Hans-Benjamin Braun, over a two-year period after she had first reported the issue to the authorities in Belfield. 
Ní Shúilleabháin told Noteworthy that she was on a three-year contract when the harassment began. While still in this fixed-term position, she reported it to An Garda Síochána. However, she said that being made permanent in 2018 gave her “the impetus to make the formal complaint in UCD”.

UCD stated that they were reviewing their policy after Ní Shúilleabháin told her story publicly. In response to this, the academic called on these policies to be victim-centred and for HEIs to engage with groups working with women when reviewing and developing policies on assault and harassment. 
The National Women’s Council subsequently called on “all third level institutes to prioritise the full implementation of the ‘National Framework’ on sexual harassment and violence” in HEIs. This framework was launched by the Government last year. 
With new initiatives being rolled out to try and address this, O’Keefe said that precarious workers also need to be included in their development. 
Refocus by looking down the ladder 
When it comes to all policies in HEIs, more women policymakers are needed, according to Ferrara. After she wrote her article on her experience of precarity as a mother, a number of women in senior positions contacted her and said they were sorry that she had to speak up. It takes women – including mothers – who are in leadership positions to recognise challenges faced by more vulnerable groups, she added. 
The lack of women in senior positions in academia is often termed ‘the leaky pipeline’. The latest Higher Education Authority (HEA) statistics from 2019 show that more undergrads, postgrads and lecturers were female, but this drops substantially at higher levels to 39% of senior lectures and 26% of professors. 
Source: Noteworthy/Flourish
At the start of October, Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris announced funding for 15 female-only senior academic leadership posts through the SALI initiative. The same number of posts were funded by the Government last year and Harris said they “intend to do another 15 next year”.   
“It’s so important when we look at the concept of leadership that we have diverse leadership, inclusive leadership and promote gender equality”, he added.  
Noteworthy asked the Minister, through the Department of Higher Education, if any actions are being taken for diverse groups on fixed-term and temporary contracts in the third level sector. The spokesperson did not respond to this query, as well as a number of others we put to them, but said:  
“The Department has engaged with the higher education sector to provide more clarity on the matters you have raised. However, a number of these questions should be raised directly with them or the Higher Education Authority.” 
When we put similar questions to the HEA, a spokesperson said they do “not have responsibility in the Industrial Relations space” and referred us to the Department of Higher Education but did provide some information on the Athena SWAN awards.  
In addition to these initiatives, O’Keefe said that HEIs need to look downwards to those who keep the university going – the teaching assistants, tutors, hourly-paid workers, cleaners and caterers – to really understand what gender inequality looks like, she explained.  
Most recent studies on gender inequality in the higher education sector focus on those holding secure academic positions, according to O’Keefe’s article last year, with the focus on “women’s access to professorial or top managerial positions”.  
“When we only look at that narrow slice of pie, that’s a problem,” O’Keefe told Noteworthy. She added without a focus on precarious workers “we’re not going to tackle it at all”.

Waterford 0-21
THE SILVERWARE CONTINUES to stack up for Limerick under John Kiely’s watch and their status as 2020 hurling market leaders remains intact.
But that was only reinforced after they survived the stern examination posed by Waterford in today’s Munster final, an often gripping contest eventually settled by the closing kick that Limerick possessed in front of goal.
The successful defence of their provincial title was ensured by the manner in which they outscored Waterford 0-7 to 0-3 in the final quarter. Aaron Gillane again top scored with 0-10 while Graeme Mulcahy (0-4) and Peter Casey (0-3) also contributed significantly alongside him in the full-forward line as.
The eventual losers brought plenty to this showdown. Stephen Bennett was immense in attack for Waterford as he finished with 0-12 to his credit. Tadhg De Búrca gave another towering display in defence while at different stages Austin Gleeson, Jack Prendergast and Jake Dillon were really influential in directing the game.

Waterford were level at both water breaks while they trailed by three at half-time and four at the finish. That helped illustrate the nature of this game, passages of great effort by the Deise side to stay in the hunt and then Limerick unleashing their scoring class to push on. 
Waterford, cast as underdogs beforehand, would have been reasonably happy with the summary of the first half. They hit rough patches early on when Limerick’s forward movement looked sharp, all three members of the full-forward line pointing from play iniside the first four minutes, and the spell after the second water break when they were outscored by 0-5 to 0-1.
But Waterford dug in and stuck to their task in a determined fashion. They drew level at 0-7 apiece by the water break and trailed 0-14 to 0-11 at the break. Stephen Bennett’s free-taking was terrific, converting five and only missing one. His 32nd minute effort travelled all the way over the bar from 100 yards out while Austin Gleeson chipped in with two neat points in the early stages as well.
The problem they had to contend was Limerick never lost their capacity to rattle over points. Aaron Gillane chalked up six in the first half, divided between four frees and two from play, while Peter Casey was in lively form with a trio of scores.

Waterford roared into action after half-time. They struck the opening three points of the second half and outscored Limerick by 0-7 to 0-3 between the midway mark and the 51st minute. Then Limerick started to empty their bench with substitutes Seamus Flanagan and Adrian Breen both getting on the scoresheet late on. 
The gap stood at two, 0-21 to 0-19, in Limerick’s favour with ten minutes of normal time left on the clock. The champions anchored down their challenge with Sean Finn and Kyle Hayes both inspirational in defence. That prevented Waterford getting the goal they required with increasing desperation if they were going to salvage this.

There are examples of small numbers of people congregating for social purposes and simply ignoring the important public health messages. They are putting our collective progress at risk.
 “We are also seeing a number of outbreaks across the country. These include outbreaks in association with funerals. We understand that this is a difficult time for families but it is really important that we do everything we can to avoid the circumstances which promote transmission of the virus.
“There have also been outbreaks associated with workplace settings. As we head into a new working week, we need to stay at home other than for essential reasons and for personal exercise within 5km.

Trump’s statements came in tweets that included several baseless claims about the November 3 presidential vote, which state and federal officials say was safe and secure.
The president tweeted that “he won”, something he had not said before publicly, though he said the Democrat’s victory was only “in the eyes” of the media.
Biden defeated his rival by winning back a trio of mid-western battleground states: Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and topped the 270 electoral vote threshold to clinch the presidency.
So far, Biden has 77.5 million votes, the most ever by a winning candidate, to Trump’s 72.3 million.
The president has previously refused to accept the results of the election and he dug in again Sunday, saying: “I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go.”
Even while seemingly acknowledging Biden’s victory, he also argued without evidence that the former vice president only won because the election was “rigged”.
Trump then made unsubstantiated complaints about access for poll watchers and vote tabulations, and asserted “WE WILL WIN!”. Twitter soon posted warning labels about the tweets.
Election officials from both political parties have stated publicly that the election went well. 
Trump’s campaign has tried to mount legal challenges across the country, but many have been thrown out and none has included any evidence that the outcome might be reversed.

More than a week after election day, Trump has neither called Biden nor made a formal concession, and White House officials have insisted they are preparing for a second term.
In recent days, Trump appeared to be inching closer to acknowledging the reality of his loss.
In comments in the Rose Garden about a coronavirus vaccine on Friday, Trump said his administration would “not be going to a lockdown” to slow the spread of Covid-19, and added that “whatever happens in the future, who knows which administration it will be? I guess time will tell.”
Today, Trump also renewed his groundless attacks on election technology firm Dominion Voting Systems, without evidence of any serious irregularities.","The president’s message came as he repeated several baseless claims about the presidential vote.",2,0,0,69819,"Nov 15th 2020, 4:58 PM"

Dr Gabriel Scally said he agreed with Tánaiste Leo Varadkar’s assessment that it was too early for people to consider booking flights home for the festive period.
Dr Scally, who is president of epidemiology and public health at the Royal Society of Medicine, said some travellers who did return would not experience “much of a Christmas” due to the need to comply with self-isolation restrictions depending on where they had arrived from.
“I really don’t think travel should be on the agenda this Christmas,” he told RTÉ Radio One’s This Week programme.
“And I hope people stick to that because we know this virus travels very well and having people flowing in and out of countries and through airports and all the other travel that involves is a recipe for disaster.”
Last week Varadkar warned people not to book flights home to Ireland for Christmas.
He told the Dáil that it is “too soon” to make travel arrangements.
“We’re not in a position at this point to advise people that it’s safe to come home for Christmas and I know that’s a tough message,” he said.
Last week the Government said that people travelling to Ireland from “red” listed regions will no longer have to restrict their movements once they receive a negative Covid-19 test after arrival. The test must be taken five days after they return to return.
Under the new traffic light system, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control will publish a weekly map of the EU using a three-stage colour system (green, orange and red) to indicate the level of risk in each area.
Those new travel rules, which are due to come into effect from midnight on November 29, had raised hopes for many families that a Christmas reunion would be possible.

The Government has recently given the green light to allow Covid-19 testing for passengers travelling through DAA airports in Dublin and Cork.
Passengers will be able to get a test before and after their flight at private testing facilities. Tests are expected to cost between €100 and €200.
But planing on returning to Ireland for the festive period has been criticised by experts. Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan said flying home for Christmas was not essential.
“We think people should avoid non-essential travel and continue to do so for the foreseeable future,” Dr Holohan said at NPHET’s Thursday night press briefing. 
Taoiseach Micheál Martin said his government would give people notice “before the end of November” of what the plans for the Christmas period will be “so that people can make preparations”.

Passport stamp
Meanwhile, Fianna Fáil MEP Billy Kelleher has called on the Department of Foreign Affairs to initiate negotiations at EU, and WHO, level on developing a passport “Covid Stamp” to demonstrate vaccination against the virus.
The Ireland South MEP made the call as it became clear that vulnerable populations would start to receive a vaccine in late 2020 and early 2021.
He said Ireland needs a standardised system where travellers can demonstrate that they have received the vaccine, and are therefore not required to self-isolate or quarantine upon entering different countries.
“At present, the WHO issues the Carte Jaune – Yellow Card to show that vaccinations against certain communicable diseases, such as the Yellow Fever virus, have been administered,” Kelleher said.

As of the end of October, 612,817 outpatients in Ireland are on a waiting list for care, according to the latest figures from the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).
The number of people waiting to be seen by a consultant has reached a record high.
The waiting list has grown by nearly 45,600 since last year, when over 567,000 were awaiting care at the end of October 2019.
In the south and southwest, hospitals in Cork, South Tipperary, Kerry and Waterford have the highest collective number of outpatients waiting to be seen of any regional hospital group in the country.
Closely following is the Ireland East Hospital Group, which includes several hospitals in Dublin, Kildare, Westmeath, Kilkenny and Wexford; and the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group, which includes the Midland Regional Hospitals in Portlaoise and Tullamore and more hospitals in Dublin, Kildare, and Offaly.
Overall, there are more than 844,000 people in Ireland on waiting lists for healthcare.
The Irish Hospital Consultants Association (IHCA) has pointed to 500 vacant consultation positions as a factor to the growing waiting lists.
IHCA President Professor Alan Irvine said that the government ” can no longer ignore the fundamental requirement that the provision of timely hospital care to patients cannot be achieved with an insufficient number of hospital consultants and hundreds of vacant permanent consultant posts”.
No amount of investment in services will reduce waiting lists unless we recruit and retain the necessary number of consultants to deliver timely care.”
Irvine said that in addition to filling the consultant posts, “additional acute hospital capacity needs to be commissioned and opened at speed to provide essential care to non-Covid-19 patients as well as to Covid-19 patients”.
Sinn Féin spokesperson for Health David Cullinane said that the latest figures show wait times are “going up year-on-year”.
“In October 2016, the number of people on outpatient waiting lists was 438,931. This had grown to 567,221 by September 2019 and now stands at 612,817,” Cullinane said.
“Of that, the number of patients waiting 18 months or longer since 2016 has risen from 26,796 to 153,872. That is an increase of 127,076 patients over four years,” he said.
“The numbers waiting 18 months or longer for an inpatient procedure have risen from 4,733 to 8,498 in the last year.

“Several constituents who came to me are part of 7,963 waiting more than a year on a cardiology appointment,” Cullinane said.
“Cardiovascular problems are, alongside cancer, the leading cause of death in this state. Yet the number of people waiting more than a year has doubled in the last four years,” he said.
“Despite all of the spin, wait times are going up year-on-year, and this is not Covid-related.
“Treatment for scoliosis in children and cancer services – medical, radiology and surgery oncology – are also down nearly 30% this year.”
Cullinane said that Ireland needs to “get real” about “investing in health or we will continue to cause more suffering and hardship for people in need of urgent treatment.”","The outpatient waiting list has grown by nearly 45,600 since last year.",20,0,0,16926,"Nov 15th 2020, 3:03 PM"

“As a result of the ongoing personal and collective sacrifices of so many of our people and businesses over the last week, the number of cases has continued to decline, albeit at a slower rate than during the previous week,” Swann said.

The TV star, who enjoyed decades in the limelight, died in hospital yesterday, his longtime agent and family friend Pat Lake-Smith said.
O’Connor was a TV fixture with shows such as Today With Des And Mel and Des O’Connor Tonight, and he also hosted Countdown.
His agent said in a statement to the PA news agency: “It is with great sorrow that I confirm that Des O’Connor passed away yesterday.
“He had been admitted to hospital just over a week ago, following a fall at his home in Buckinghamshire.
“He was recovering well and had been in great spirits, visited by his family – in accordance with hospital lockdown regulations – and looking forward to going home.
“Unfortunately yesterday evening his condition suddenly deteriorated and he drifted peacefully away in his sleep.”
O’Connor presented his own prime-time TV shows for over 45 years. He first fronted his own show in 1963, while the success of his singing career saw him sell 16 million records and spend 117 weeks in the top 10 of the charts.
The four-times married star appeared on stage around the world, including hundreds of shows at the London Palladium.
He had his own US TV programme and his chat show Des O’Connor Tonight was a British television staple for a quarter of a century.
He also hosted Channel 4 quiz show Countdown with Carol Vorderman, with the pair bowing out together in 2008.
At 72, the chat show host became a father again with his fiancee Jodie Brooke Wilson.
The couple later married, when O’Connor was 75 and Wilson was 38.
He had four daughters from his three previous marriages.

As Brexit negotiations come down to the wire, Coveney again expressed concern at the Internal Market Bill being championed by Johnson in the UK’s parliament.
Johnson has insisted that he will press on in the Commons with elements of the proposed legislation that would allow the Government to break international law despite opposition from the House of Lords in recent days.
The move comes as London and Brussels are set to continue talks this week ahead of the Brexit transition period coming to a close at the end of the year.
Coveney, who said things need to “move” this week, told Sky News: “Even if we do get a new trade deal negotiated by both sides, if the British Government is determined to continue with their Internal Market Bill – to reintroduce parts of that Bill that were removed by the House of Lords this week – then, I think this is a deal that won’t be ratified by the EU.
“Because there is no way the EU will agree to ratify a new agreement if the British Government is breaking the existing agreement that is not even 12 months old, and breaking international law by doing that.”
Coveney also called for a cooling of rhetoric in trade talks, especially in the contentious area of fishing rights.
“We really have to try and find a way of coming up with a compromise on fish that both sides can live with,” he said.
“And we need to try and dial down the language on this because it is very easy to become emotive.”
Coveney insisted a deal was “doable”.

He said: “I think I would sum it up by saying this is very difficult, but, it’s also very doable.
“And I think the consequences of not getting a trade deal and a future relationship deal… before the end of the year, I think is very significant.”
Environment Secretary George Eustice said next week is “a week when things need to move” for the UK and EU to agree to a trade deal.
Eustice said: “Both sides recognise that time is very, very short. It’s not long ago we were saying we needed to get some kind of conclusion by the middle of October.
“People have persevered with these talks. There does come a point frankly where businesses need to know what they are preparing for.”
He added: “You can always squeeze out extra time if you need to, if you’re nearly there.”
“But, I agree with Simon Coveney, perhaps we can agree on this much… this needs to be a week when things move, when we break through some of these difficult issues and get resolution and at least have some sort of headlines – if you like – of an agreement,” he said.

Speaking on Sunday with Miriam on RTÉ Radio One, King said that he is eager to come to Ireland to visit relatives and trace his family history when Covid-19 has been alleviated.
King, CNN’s chief national correspondent, was the face of much of the network’s coverage of the recent election.
He attracted positive attention from CNN viewers, including watchers from Ireland who picked up on his Irish roots.
King told O’Callaghan on the radio today that he would “would like to come [to Ireland] and I would tell the barkeeper right now that it better be more than one pint”.
“I’ve been to Ireland several times but always for work. I covered the White House for a long time, so I was there with President Clinton and President Bush, but I’ve never been there just as a visitor or tourist or as an Irish American to retrace my roots, and that’s my fault,” King said.
One of the great seeds planted in me from this election and the interest in Ireland is to make sure I get there not just once, but to begin the journey soon.
“My mission out of this election is, I keep telling [cousin Jacqueline Kenny], I’m gonna come visit as soon as I can and learn more about it.”
King said he believed that Joe Biden’s win over incumbent Donald Trump will be a positive for Ireland.
He said that Trump has “little interest in anything outside the shores of the United States” unless it was in his interests.
“Joe Biden loves to stress his Irish roots.  And so of all the countries in the world who could think, ‘we’ll get more attention’ or our phone calls are gonna get returned’ or that “Team Biden will pay attention to us,’ I think Ireland can be very happy,” King said.
CNN is among US news outlets that called the election for Joe Biden on Saturday, 7 November.
As votes were counted after Election Day on 3 November, CNN called the races in each state as enough votes came in to project a winner.
King said that for this election in particular, the CNN team were especially cautious with calling a result.
I think there’s great theatre in a close election – why would you want to end a play in the middle?”
“We are very cautious. We do project states when we have enough data to tell us, even though there are still votes to be counted, statistical probabilities and the like, but we’re a lot more cautious,” King said.

“In this election, because of how everything was so unusual and how different states were doing it in different ways, we made it a rule coming in that we’re going to have precaution as a standard, we’re going to have very clear standards and metrics about how we make decisions, and we will not bend those rules,” he said.

692,193,"Armenian opposition politician arrested over alleged prime minister assassination plot",https://www.thejournal.ie/armenia-politician-assasination-plot-arrest-5267570-Nov2020/,"AN OPPOSITION LEADER in Armenia has been arrested and accused of preparing to kill the prime minister, his lawyer said, adding to the political turmoil created by a controversial peace deal with neighbouring Azerbaijan.
Artur Vanetsyan, head of the centre-right Homeland party, was arrested yesterday after being summoned to the headquarters of the Armenian security forces, his lawyers Lusine Sahakyan and Ervand Varosyan said.
They called the detention a “persecution” and denied the allegations against their client — that he was preparing to seize power after the murder of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan.
Pashinyan has faced violent street protests and fierce criticism from Armenia’s political opposition since he signed a peace deal with Azerbaijan to end fighting over the disputed region of Nagorny Karabakh which erupted in September.
Armenia faced heavy losses by technologically superior Azeri troops and Pashinyan agreed to cede large parts of the mostly Christian and ethnically Armenian region to Muslim-majority Azerbaijan in order to bring an end to the hostilities.
Vanetsyan, a former boss of Armenia’s security services known for his links to Russia, was also briefly detained last week along with other senior opposition figures during anti-government protests which saw the prime minister called a “traitor”.

694,212,"'Part of me was thinking, 'You're working in a Test match against the All Blacks''",https://www.the42.ie/shane-lehane-wallabies-5266009-Nov2020/,"AT THIS STAGE, Shane Lehane reckons he has been on tour for 150 days.
The Cobh man, who is part of the Wallabies set-up, has spent nearly five months away from his home in Melbourne and has had more than his fair share of hotel rooms, bus journeys, and Zoom calls at this stage.
It has been testing in a personal sense but strength and conditioning specialist Lehane is loving his opportunity with the Wallabies and moments like those after last weekend’s win over the All Blacks in Brisbane make it all worthwhile.
Lehane first spoke to Rugby Australia’s head of athletic performance, Dean Benton, last Christmas about coming on board for what was meant to be a summer series against Ireland and the regular Rugby Championship this year.
Covid-19 ruined all best-laid plans, however, and Lehane didn’t know for certain that he would be linking up with the Wallabies until only a few months ago. 
Lehane is the lead S&C coach with the Melbourne Rebels, meaning he had already been away from home for several months for the Super Rugby AU competition when his Wallabies secondment was finally confirmed.
The Rebels were based in Terrigal, close to Sydney, during Super Rugby due to the severe Covid restrictions back home in the state of Victoria, so Lehane went from that camp straight into the Wallabies set-up without even getting a chance to nip home.
“I basically dropped my Rebels kit into the Rugby Australia warehouse and swapped it for an Asics bag with my Wallabies gear and headed straight back on tour,” says Lehane from the Wallabies’ current base in the Hunter Valley, a few hours north of Sydney.
“I reckon it’s probably the longest-ever rugby tour. It’s like back in the day when the Lions used to head off on a boat and not come home for months.”
With his wife, Sarah, back in Melbourne with their two-year-old daughter, Lara, it was a very difficult decision but the chance to link up with Dave Rennie’s new coaching staff was impossible to resist. 
The support from home has been everything for Lehane.
“It was particularly hectic when Sarah was working full-time, daycare was closed and Victoria was in lockdown.
Lehane [left] with Wallabies attack coach Scott Wisemantel.
“I’d be calling home and she would have our two-year-old with her while trying to manage meetings on Zoom and I’d be on a day off at the beach in Terrigal!
“But, to be honest, Sarah has been amazing. If she had turned around and said she wasn’t comfortable or coping well, I would have gone home. But she has been a massive support and you couldn’t do it without that. She understands it’s an amazing opportunity.”
Lehane first moved to Australia to join the Rebels in 2015 following five-and-a-half years with the Leicester Tigers, as well as internships with Ulster, Munster, and Ireland before that. 
His work in the Rebels’ set-up naturally brought him onto the Wallabies’ radar and Lehane has loved joining the national team in recent months as the Rennie era got underway with four consecutive games against the All Blacks.
The first two were on Kiwi soil, meaning the Wallabies had two weeks of isolation together upon landing in New Zealand, so a “pretty good environment to get to know people really well.”
Lehane joined Rennie’s backroom staff at the same time as forwards coach Geoff Parling, who had worked with at Leicester and the Rebels, while he obviously knew some of the players too. But he praises head coach Rennie for his work in bringing together what was a very new group.
“Dave Rennie has been really good on the cultural side of things, embracing a multi-cultural group with players of Fijian, Samoan, Tongan, and Cook Islands backgrounds.

“He’s done a big cultural piece around expressing their national identity and how that fits in with the Australian identity. It has been cool to be part of that.”
The Wallabies earned a 16-16 draw in Wellington first up against the All Blacks and Lehane had to pinch himself as he watched on with a front-row seat.
“One part of me had to take a step back and think, ‘You’re working in a Test match against the All Blacks.’ It was very exciting.”
There was a defeat at Eden Park and then a record loss back in Australia before Rennie’s men delivered an excellent performance last weekend to deservedly win 24-22 in a game that featured two red cards.
With a fresh-faced Wallabies matchday squad including 20-year-olds Harry Wilson, Jordan Petaia, Noah Lolesio, and Angus Bell, as well as several other inexperienced young players alongside stalwarts like captain Michael Hooper, it was a thrilling result for Aussie rugby.
Lehane is hoping to continue with work with the Wallabies alongside his Rebels role.
“A big chunk of the boys have played together in the U20 set-up and have been reasonably successful,” says Lehane. “So there’s a young and enthusiastic group coming up and it’s just a case of getting familiar with playing at Test level.
“With some of the younger guys, there is obviously respect for the All Blacks but I’m not sure if there is any fear there among those young guys.
“They have won at underage levels and been competitive in their initial Tests against the All Blacks. That third game was a bit of an outlier in terms of where this team is going.”
As an S&C coach, Lehane has also enjoyed working with a crop of you men who are athletic specimens.
“They obviously need experience and exposure to this level but Harry Wilson is a great athlete, Jordan Petaia is something pretty special, Angus Bell is an excellent athlete, so there are a lot of good young players coming through. These guys have got so much energy and excitement and that’s pretty infectious, to be honest.”
There have been Covid-related challenges for the Wallabies along the way, of course, but it has certainly been a positive start to life to the new era and while Lehane is naturally pining for his family and his own bed, he is loving being part of the journey.
There is nothing nailed down just yet and he is expected back with the Rebels for 2021 but would love to remain involved with the Wallabies in a potential combined role. Lehane stresses that this is not simply about furthering his career.
“We would probably be Australian citizens by now if it wasn’t for the Covid situation,” says Lehane.
“Our daughter was born over here, so it’s exciting to work for the Wallabies obviously, but there’s also a real attachment to Australia as a country. It’s more than just a career opportunity.”
But first, finishing out the Tri Nations successfully is on the agenda. The Wallabies have two games against Argentina in the coming weeks and even before the Pumas’ stunning first-ever victory over the All Blacks, Lehane was warning of their threat.
“Argentina have a point to prove after travelling over here, spending time in isolation, and on into the Tri-Nations. That will be a pretty tough challenge.
“But the mood in our squad is definitely buoyant and there’s excitement in the group.”","Cobh man Shane Lehane has joined the Wallabies set-up in recent months.",4,0,0,42454,"Nov 15th 2020, 10:00 AM"
695,193,"Peru president faces calls to resign after three protesters killed",https://www.thejournal.ie/peru-president-manuel-merino-call-resign-protesters-killed-5267537-Nov2020/,"THE HEAD OF Peru’s Congress has called for the “immediate resignation” of interim president Manuel Merino after a violent crackdown on protests against his new government left at least three dead and more than 60 injured.
Thousands have taken to the streets in days of protests against Merino following the ouster of his popular predecessor Martin Vizcarra, who was impeached on corruption allegations on Monday.
“I ask Mr. Merino to evaluate his immediate resignation,” Congress head Luis Valdez said in a statement Saturday night to Channel N television.
Lawmakers will meet in an emergency session on Sunday to discuss Merino’s resignation, a statement released later on the Congress Twitter account said.
The ultimatum came after news of the death of three protesters during a massive and peaceful march in Lima, which was violently repressed by police firing shotgun pellets and tear gas.
Lima mayor Jorge Munoz, from the same center-right Popular Action party as Merino, also demanded the resignation of the president.
“I just found out about the third death” in the protests, said the Archbishop of Lima, Carlos Castillo, deploring the police crackdown in a statement to state television.
Police reported two deaths, while the National Human Rights Coordinator indicated it was investigating whether there were four.
The Ombudsman’s Office said the first fatality, a 25-year-old man, was killed by pellet shots to the head and face. At least 63 protesters were injured, the health ministry said.
The police tactics have been criticized by the UN and rights organizations such as Amnesty International since the protests began on Tuesday.
Ministers resign
Seven of the 18 ministers in Merino’s cabinet announced their resignation Saturday night after the police crackdown, according to local media.
The political crisis appeared to be heading towards the resignation of Merino, whose whereabouts were unknown early today.
“I’m calling him and I can’t get through, I have no idea if he has resigned. I’m not a fortune teller,” Prime Minister Antero Flores Araoz, the government’s number two, told RPP radio.
Lima’s international airport said it was closed due to the night curfew.
Merino has remained silent since the crackdown on Saturday and the call for his resignation.
At around 2:00 am local time, the government released a photo of Merino meeting with his cabinet, but doubts arose as to when it was taken because it showed the health minister who had resigned hours earlier.
Tear gas
Thousands took to the streets on Saturday in opposition to Merino, the former Congress speaker who assumed office on Tuesday as Peru’s third president in four years.
The mostly young protesters gathered in various cities to oppose what they call a parliamentary coup against ousted president Vizcarra.

The largest march in Lima attracted thousands of people, with police again using tear gas fired from helicopters to disperse protesters who were threatening to march towards the Congress building.
They carried signs reading “Merino, you are not my president” and “Merino impostor” while chanting.
The municipal authorities in Lima turned off the public lighting in Plaza San Martin on the crowd gathered there.
The plaza has been the center of protests in the capital.
A group of protesters approached the area around Merino’s home, east of Lima, banging pots and drums.
Archbishop of Trujillo Miguel Cabrejos urged the government to engage in dialogue and respect the right to protest. 
“It is essential to listen and attend to the cries and the clamor of the population to regain confidence, tranquility and social peace,” he said in a statement.
When he took office on Tuesday, Merino said he would respect the calendar for the next general elections, scheduled for April 11, 2021 and would leave power on July 28, 2021, the day when Vizcarra’s mandate was to end.
Vizcarra had broad popular support since succeeding Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, the former Wall Street banker who was forced to resign under threat of impeachment over corruption allegations in 2018.
Congress impeached and dismissed Vizcarra on Monday over allegations he took kickbacks from developers when he was governor of the Moquegua region in 2014, charges he denies.","Seven ministers of Peru’s cabinet resigned last night.",3,0,0,13877,"Nov 15th 2020, 9:40 AM"

Charlotte Kirk landed in NYC to network in the acting world – and wound up in relationships with very high up men. The discovery of these relationships rocked Hollywood.

And there was Kevin Tsujihara, at the time the chairman and CEO of Warner Bros. Entertainment. He and Kirk crossed paths, briefly but fatefully, in 2013. Their collision exploded into view in March 2019, when someone released a trove of astonishingly explicit text messages indicating that, seemingly in exchange for sex, the studio executive had helped Kirk secure a small part in 2018’s Ocean’s 8, among other roles. Within days of the leak, Tsujihara, though he denied the allegations, was forced to resign from Warner Bros.

It was late October. The days were foggy. By lunchtime, a pale sun fought to break through, and, for about an hour before it did, an unearthly and sickly yellow light clung to everything. And then there was sunshine. One day, however, the fog licked its tongue over Venice all afternoon as well. At twilight, a strange, dark blueness descended. I got a vaporetto from San Zaccaria to San Stae and there was no other traffic, none at all, on the Grand Canal. After dark, as I walked from Piazza San Marco to Piazza Santa Margherita, the restaurants were open, but hardly anyone was inside or even at the outside tables. When I bought ice cream, the little cup was put into a paper bag and I was warned not to eat it on the street. Even pulling your mask down for a second to sample ice cream was not allowed. Soon, the restaurants would be ordered to close at six o’clock.

699,190,"Debunked: No, the HSE hasn't said its coronavirus testing method is useless",https://www.thejournal.ie/hse-testing-5262985-Nov2020/,"A NUMBER OF posts being shared on social media in recent weeks claim the HSE has ‘admitted’ the coronavirus test used in Ireland is “useless” or “not accurate”.
These posts include a photo of an information leaflet given to people who attend for a coronavirus test. The leaflet states that there are limitations with the test as “no test is 100% accurate” and lists some of these limitations.
The viral posts all highlight one line in the leaflet which states: “The coronavirus testing method cannot be guaranteed as accurate, up-to-date, reliable, error-free, suitable, effective or as having any specific result or outcome.”
One post claims this equates to the HSE admitting the test is “useless”.
Another claims the HSE has “confirmed” the test is not accurate or reliable and that there is no specific result from the test. 
The leaflet
First of all, TheJournal.ie checked with the HSE and this is a legitimate leaflet, given to people who attend an appointment for a coronavirus test when it is suspected they may have Covid-19 or if they are a close contact of a confirmed case. 
The HSE said it is just one of the wide range of Covid-19 information resources developed by the HSE.
“It provides information on what the test involves, test results and also the limitation of testing for Coid-19.
“The leaflet is provided to people attending for a Covid-19 test, together with another leaflet on self-isolating at home. By providing information on the test, including its limitations, people attending for testing can make an informed choice and decide if they wish to be tested or not for Covid-19.”
How accurate is the test?
The test we use in Ireland uses the the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction method, known as RT-PCR, or PCR for short.
PCR test methods are considered by the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) as the gold standard for diagnosing suspected cases of Covid-19.
It generally involves taking material samples through nasal and throat swabs. The test in the laboratory after a swab is taken looks for viral generic material.
Speaking to TheJournal.ie, Dr Cillian dr Gascun, director of the National Viral Reference Laboratory (NVRL) said it is “the most accurate test we have, the most sensitive test we have and the most specific test we have”. 
“It’s widely uses in the diagnostic laboratories for virology and indeed for bacteriology as well. It’s not something we just developed for SARS-CoV-2, it’s been in use for many years for herpes, for the likes of HIV, hepatitis C, and we know that it’s incredible sensitive.”
The HSE said “all tests have limitations”, including diagnostic testing for Covid-19. It said extensive validations have been carried out in our laboratories to ensure that the test used shows high sensitivity.
The test is estimated to have a sensitivity of between 71 and 98%. 
The limitations
De Gascun said there are two main issues that may arise with a PCR test. The first relates to the quality of the specimen – there has to be viral material on the swab to test. 
The second issue, he said, can relate to the presence of the virus in the upper respiratory tract (nose/throat) – which is where the swab is taken from – at the time of sampling.
“We’ve seen reports from our colleagues in hospitals that people can be admitted with respiratory illness and at the time of admission the virus isn’t present in the respiratory tract, so the PCR doesn’t detect anything,” he said.
De Gascun said if a person gets a negative result but doctors in a hospital still believe they have Covid-19 because they are displaying symptoms of the disease, a test using a sample from the lower respiratory tract may detect the virus. The lower respiratory tract consists of the trachea down to the lungs.
More invasive processes than a swab, such as a bronchoalveolar lavage – liquid injected into a segment of the lung through a bronchoscope – can be used to collect these samples. 
He said this is why it is important that people “don’t get caught up in the test results”.
“If you have a high index of suspicion and it is not detected then we would encourage people to get a follow-up sample and ideally a lower respiratory tract sample. But we’re trying to balance the logistics, obviously a lower respiratory tract sample can be quite unpleasant so we’re not going to subject everybody in communities to that,” he said.
“If people have symptoms, despite an undetected test result, we would need them to continue to follow public health advice because the test is just one component.”
De Gascun said it is important for health services to make people aware of the limitations of testing, as the HSE has done in this case, because of “trust in the system and awareness and education.
#OPEN JOURNALISM No news is bad news Support The Journal Your contributions will help us continue to deliver the stories that are important to you
SUPPORT US NOW
He said these limitations are not confined to laboratory medicine, there are limitations with routine medical tests such as x-rays and blood tests.
“I think people have grown up watching things like House or ER where test results are black and white and that’s not the way it is in the real world. We know that the majority of our tests work well the majority of the time. There’s also an uncertainty of measurement there and it’s really important to education people and say these are the limitations but the test works very well.”
The claims
The posts that have been shared on social media claim the HSE, by informing people of the limitations of testing, has admitted the testing method is “useless”. The posts also claim the HSE has “confirmed” the testing method is not accurate and not reliable.
The HSE has never said the PCR testing method is “useless”. It is globally recognised as the most sensitive method to use to detect the coronavirus and this is why the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) recommended its use. 
Further, in its information leaflet on the limitations of testing, the HSE did not say the test was “not accurate”. It stated that it could not be guaranteed as accurate. As the HSE stated in its leaflet – and as explained by Dr de Gascun – no testing method, whether it’s a Covid-19 test, a blood test or an x-ray, can be described as 100% accurate. 
*********
There is a lot of false news and scaremongering being spread in Ireland at the moment about coronavirus. Here are some practical ways for you to assess whether the messages that you’re seeing – especially on WhatsApp – are true or not.
STOP, THINK AND CHECK
Look at where it’s coming from. Is it someone you know? Do they have a source for the information (e.g. the HSE website) or are they just saying that the information comes from someone they know? A lot of the false news being spread right now is from people claiming that messages from ‘a friend’ of theirs. Have a look yourself – do a quick Google search and see if the information is being reported elsewhere. 
Secondly, get the whole story, not just a headline. A lot of these messages have got vague information (“all the doctors at this hospital are panicking”) and don’t mention specific details. This is often – but not always a sign – that it may not be accurate. 
Finally, see how you feel after reading it. A lot of these false messages are designed to make people feel panicked. They’re deliberately manipulating your feelings to make you more likely to share it. If you feel panicked after reading something, check it out and see if it really is true.

The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, was signed virtually today on the sidelines of the annual summit of the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), hosted by Vietnam.
“I am delighted to say that after eight years of hard work, as of today, we have officially brought RCEP negotiations to a conclusion for signing,” said host country Vietnam’s prime minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc.
“The conclusion of RCEP negotiation, the largest free trade agreement in the world, will send a strong message that affirms ASEAN’s leading role in supporting the multilateral trading system, creating a new trading structure in the region, enabling sustainable trade facilitation, revitalising the supply chains disrupted by Covid-19 and assisting the post-pandemic recovery,” Phuc said.
The accord will take already low tariffs on trade between member countries still lower, over time, and is less comprehensive than an 11-nation trans-Pacific trade deal that US president Donald Trump pulled out of shortly after taking office.
Apart from the 10-member ASEAN, it includes China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, but not the United States.
Officials said the accord leaves the door open for India, which dropped out due to fierce domestic opposition to its market-opening requirements, to rejoin the bloc.
It is not expected to go as far as the European Union in integrating member economies but does build on existing free trade arrangements.
The deal has powerful symbolic ramifications, showing that nearly four years after Trump launched his “America first” policy of forging trade deals with individual countries, Asia remains committed to multi-nation efforts towards freer trade that are seen as a formula for future prosperity.
Ahead of today’s RCEP “special summit” meeting, Japanese prime minister Yoshihide Suga said he would firmly convey his government’s support for “broadening a free and fair economic zone, including a possibility of India’s future return to the deal, and hope to gain support from the other countries”.
The accord is also a coup for China, by far the biggest market in the region with more than 1.3 billion people, allowing Beijing to cast itself as a “champion of globalisation and multilateral co-operation” and giving it greater influence over rules governing regional trade, said Gareth Leather, senior Asian economist for Capital Economics.
China’s official Xinhua News Agency quoted premier Li Keqiang hailing the agreement as a victory against protectionism, in remarks delivered via a video link.
“The signing of the RCEP is not only a landmark achievement of East Asian regional co-operation, but also a victory of multilateralism and free trade,” Li said.
ASEAN members include Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Burma, the Philippines, Thailand, Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam.

“That time with Jack defined my life simply because it needed defining”, says Paul McGrath in a new film, Finding Jack Charlton. 
Source: Telefy/YouTube
The film follows Jack in his final days, as he and his family attempt the final and fraught act of definition: seeing Jack Charlton as himself rather than the dementia that so coldly pilfered his extraordinary life. 
It’s a deeply affecting piece of work, weaving extensive archival work with scenes from the Charlton family home, as Jack is brought fishing and shown footage from those colour-kissed days of valiant glory with Ireland.
At times, his search for clarity of memory from the murk of dementia is heartbreaking.
“They think a lot of you in Ireland, don’t they?” says his wife Pat at one point.
Jack looks blankly in response and eventually says, “I have no idea.”
“It’s a difficult thing for people to live with and we wanted to demonstrate it”, says producer Pete Thomas. 
“But what made it less hard was Jack, right up to the end of his life, was still enjoying things in life.
“He loved being around his family, he recognised his family. And he loved the camera. If we had been filming with him and he didn’t know we were there, then it wouldn’t have felt right. But his eyes would light up. He looked at the camera and he talked to the camera, and it genuinely felt like every time he was in front of the camera he was comfortable and enjoyed it. 
“That helped us get across that he still had the glint in his eye, he still had those moments where he was Jack.” 
There’s an A-list cast of talking heads, with Bertie Ahern and Larry Mullen telling the familiar tales of how Jack helped take Ireland from the monochrome misery of the 1980s, but the dig through the archives is remarkable. 
A long-lost interview with Jack and Bobby amid Italia ’90 showed the genuine warmth that could break out between two very different brothers, while the film also unearths old camcorder footage among the squad the night they were knocked out of that World Cup. 
With the sun rising behind them, players and Jack tell tales and sing songs as Chris De Burgh serenades the group with a version of “Hey Jack” to the tune of Hey Jude. The footage radiates the candour and love that underpinned all of the players’ tributes to Jack on the day of his passing.
“It summed up that team and Jack and how comfortable they were, how united they were”, says Thomas. 
Pete made another remarkable discovery. 
“I happened to be up with Jack and his wife Pat, and I asked Pat, ‘There isn’t anything we haven’t seen, is there?’ and she said, ‘Oh, there is this one thing’, and she brought out this old envelope stuffed full of notes.”

The family kept virtually every scrap of paper Jack ever scribbled on, and so we see some of his notes on opposition teams and scouting reports of his own players. It’s a treasure trove, but most significant are a bundle of notes effectively to himself, which, when assembled, read like a charter for how he wanted himself to live his life and do his job.

Protect your own. 
You must enjoy it. 
Honesty, self-belief, bloody mindedness.

Anyone who took even a cursory look at his career with Ireland would know he made those ideas manifest.

But how to reconcile the cruelty of this story? That this man who gave millions of people some of their best memories spent the final months of his life struggling to find those same memories? 
“The thing for me were these moments of clarity that would happen”, says Thomas. “You never know to what level or depth they go, but he definitely still had moments where he was there in the room with you.
“Those things kept you feeling there’s still a light burning. It’s still Jack. And even if he can’t remember the details, he can connect with the feelings.
“I had that sitting with him watching a couple of games, old Ireland matches from World Cups. He would really enjoy it even if he didn’t necessarily remember all that happened. And he would still remember an odd player, and say, ‘Is Ray Houghton playing, or Paul McGrath?’ 
“I definitely saw a bravery from Jack in that he still wanted to be around people and still wanted to do things with his life. I saw a brilliant way of living with dementia, in terms of his wife and son, and the way they approached it. It was matter-of-fact: let’s focus on what you can do and enjoy all the things you can in life. That brought an awful lot of joy to Jack. That was the biggest thing I learned. To really focus on the things you can still do, take massive joy from them and love doing them. That was what he did right to the end.” 
And Pete’s favourite memory from making the film? 
“We were round with Pat and Jack – we weren’t filming – but I was giving them an update on how we were doing. I had a cup of tea with Pat, and Jack left to watch something and later came back into the room and said, ‘Are you still ’ere? 
“I was being told off, but my grin was off the charts. I was so happy I had been told off by Jack Charlton.”

The blaze spread through the ward at a public hospital in the northern city of Piatra Neamt, an emergency services spokeswoman said.
She said all but one of the people who died or were injured in the fire were hospital patients.
Romanian health minister Nelu Tataru told local media the fire was “most likely triggered by a short circuit”.
News outlets reported that the Piatra Neamt Regional Emergency Hospital has long been poorly managed, with eight government-appointed managers overseeing the facility in the last year.
The hospital’s current manager, Lucian Micu, was appointed just three weeks ago after his predecessor resigned over the poor treatment of patients.
The resignation followed media reports of patients, including many suspected to have Covid-19, being forced to wait outside in the cold to see a doctor.
Mr Micu said that a doctor on duty tried to save the patients from the flames and was in critical condition with first- and second-degree burns covering 80% of his body.
Another doctor and two nurses also were being treated for burns.
Piatra Neamt is about 220 miles north of the capital, Bucharest.

703,254,"Opinion: Why Biden’s presidency will be defined by the Georgia vote in January",https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/georgia-run-off-5263329-Nov2020/,"JOSEPH R. BIDEN will become the 46th President of the United States on 20 January 2021 – assuming that the numerous legal challenges launched in desperation by the Trump campaign fail to overturn the election results.
However, the fate of Biden’s first two years in office is set to be decided some two weeks prior to his inauguration.
On 5 January the state of Georgia will return to the polls for a ‘runoff election’ after a special Senate election to replace the retiring Republican Senator Johnny Isakson failed to provide a conclusive winner.
Due to the necessity of staging this special Senate election, Georgia was the only state to have both of its Senate seats up for grabs on election night.
And, in a blow to Republicans, the state’s main Senate race will now also head to a runoff after the Republican incumbent, David Perdue, finished below the 50%+1 threshold of votes required by Georgia law to win outright. 
A delicate Senate
With results having been returned from all other Senate races across the country, the Republicans currently hold a majority in the US upper-house, holding 50 seats to the Democrats’ 48.
These runoff elections in Georgia have therefore suddenly taken on an unanticipated national significance; they are set to decide the balance of the 100-person Senate for the first two years of Biden’s presidency.
The Biden-Harris administration faces many challenges, not least the possibility of a divided House.
Source: Carolyn Kaster
Should Georgia’s two Democratic candidates, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, succeed in securing both seats in early January, the Democrats will win control of the Senate – despite the floor of the upper house being split 50-50.
Within the Senate, if any vote returns a stale-mate then the Vice-President is able to cast the deciding vote. Thus, in the case of any tied Senate votes, as could be expected to happen fairly frequently in a split house, Vice-President-elect, Kamala Harris, would provide the Democrats with a functioning majority.
The importance of winning both seats is therefore crucial for Biden to deliver on many of his campaign’s promises. Failure to do so could see the newly-elected President’s first two years in office mired by political deadlock.
A Biden administration in gridlock?
Democrats know that, with a Republican-controlled Senate, it would be nearly impossible for many of the more progressive policies contained in Biden’s ‘Build Back Better’ manifesto to gain any traction – particularly the $1.7 trillion plan to reshape American climate policy. 
Indeed, Biden himself is all too aware from his time as Barack Obama’s Vice-President of the political dysfunction that can result from a Democratic presidential administration operating alongside an adversarial Republican Senate.
President Obama’s final two years in office were effectively ground to a legislative halt thanks to the efforts of Republican Senate leader, Mitch McConnell. McConnell used his party’s majority, gained in 2014, to create a legislative blockade for the Democratic president.
Through the use of the filibuster and strict partisan voting, McConnell successfully sought to leverage the Republican majority to suppress as many Democratic policies passing through the house as possible.

A remarkably pertinent example of McConnell’s strategy came in early 2016 when Justice Antonin Scalia passed away, leaving a vacancy on the Supreme Court. McConnell strenuously objected to President Obama choosing a nominee and questioned the ethical validity of an outgoing President seeking to fill a Supreme Court seat during an election year.
The Senate leader refused to act on the nomination, stymieing Obama’s efforts, and ultimately enabling President Trump to choose the nominee to fill the vacancy instead. McConnell’s attitude here is in notable contrast to his approach to recent events.
Following Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s passing, he sought to hastily push through Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court, despite the presidential election being mere weeks away.
However, Biden’s reputation as an astute bipartisan negotiator, coupled with his personal friendship with McConnell from years spent working together in the Senate, has raised hopes that his administration may end up having a more functional relationship with a Republican-controlled Senate than did Obama’s.

The McConnell wall
Many Democrats remain sceptical, however. Democratic Senator for Connecticut, Chris Murphy, told Politico recently that he expects McConnell to act so obstructively that there could be “a constitutional crisis pretty immediately”.
Given this uncertainty, the spectre of having to operate within the stifling parameters of a Republican-led Senate hangs heavily over the Democrats. 
Yet, prior to the election, it seemed almost inconceivable to many in Biden’s camp that ultimate control of the Senate would end up being decided by a runoff election in Georgia.
Over the past few months, hopes had grown among Democrats that they would be able to comfortably attain a Senate majority. However, as results began to emerge on election night, it rapidly became apparent that any such overhaul was likely off the table.
The stronger than anticipated turn-out for Republicans thwarted the election hopes of several aspirant Democratic senators. As in 2016, the polls had failed to fully portray reality, creating a misguided impression of the electoral landscape.
Targeted Republican seats in Montana, Maine and South Carolina which had seemed within reach for Democrats, ended up returning strong leads for their Republican incumbents.
All of this has led to Georgia becoming the centre of the Democrats’ focus; the place where the tone and legislative scope of Biden’s presidency will be decided.
Pending the results of Georgia’s post-election audit, which is not expected to have any significant impact on Biden’s 14,000 vote lead in the state’s presidential election results, Georgia has returned a majority for a Democratic presidential candidate for the first time since 1992.
Though an undoubted scalp for Democrats, there are fears that such favourable results are unlikely to await either of their senatorial candidates, Jon Ossoff or Raphael Warnock in the runoff.
Warnock, a Baptist Reverend with a strong history of advocacy for public healthcare reform, is the more precariously placed of the two. The fact that he managed to force a runoff is perhaps more attributable to the Republican vote being split between two broadly popular Republican candidates, rather than from the strength of his own performance.

To have any hope of gaining the Senate seat held by Republican Kelly Loeffler, Warnock will have to significantly improve on his disappointing vote-share of 33% in last week’s election.
However, it is in the other race where Democrats may be more optimistic.

Republican incumbent David Perdue’s failure to secure more the minimum 50%+1 vote threshold was a bitter disappointment for the Republican. Despite his Democrat contender, Jon Ossoff, polling favourably before the election, Perdue’s camp had been confident that he incumbent would retain his seat.

Ossoff, having forced a runoff, now seems well placed to challenge and his 48% vote share provides a solid platform to improve on. It is not inconceivable that, come January, following extensive campaigning, Ossoff could emerge the victor.
What’s more, both candidates’ chances of securing election will invariably end up relying heavily on Stacey Abrams, a Georgian political activist whose work proved central to Biden’s victory in the state. 
Following a failed gubernatorial race in 2018, marred by allegations of Republican voter suppression, Abrams has since sought to help register hundreds of thousands of urban black voters in Georgia.
It was the votes of these people in typically under-represented areas, of Atlanta in particular, that gave Biden his slender victory, and it is their votes that could prove crucial in January.
While the Democrats’ immediate focus may be on assembling a transition plan for the presidency, it will not be long before all eyes turn to Georgia.
The following two months will see a renewed frenzy of campaign activity from both Republicans and Democrats across the narrowly divided Southern state. Both sides are all too aware that the runoff elections provide the chance to shape the trajectory of Biden’s presidency before it even begins.

704,182,"'It's a huge source of stress': Women going abroad for IVF hit out at mixed messages over travel restrictions",https://www.thejournal.ie/travelling-from-ireland-to-abroad-for-ivf-5264413-Nov2020/,"THE GOVERNMENT’S MIXED messaging on travel abroad has been criticised by people who need to travel overseas for fertility treatment.
Many people choose to travel to elsewhere in Europe for treatment because the process can be thousands of euro cheaper than in Ireland.
However, people are concerned about the impact Covid-19 travel restrictions, and flights being cancelled, could have on their treatment.
Some people are missing appointments or choosing to delay their treatment, but this is not an option for others – particularly if age is an issue.
There has also been a lack of clarity on what is deemed “essential” medical treatment for travel purposes, and how long a person has to restrict their movements for when they return to Ireland after undergoing a medical procedure abroad.
Emma*, who lives in Dublin, began IVF treatment in Prague in the Czech Republic during the week. She said the process of undergoing fertility treatment is stressful enough without the added worry of travel restrictions and lack of clarity on what people should do.
She believes IVF is an essential journey, but said the government’s messaging on travel has been lacking.
“I’m on a few social media groups for people getting IVF and everyone seems really confused.
“We are allowed to travel abroad, but what is not clear and seems to be causing a lot of confusion for people, is the phase of restriction of movement.
“Do we still have to restrict our movements when returning from treatment? My reading of [the guidelines] would be that if I was an essential worker like a high-level engineer, I would not have to restrict movements coming into Ireland, so is it the same for us?”
Emma is currently taking two weeks of unpaid leave from work so she can self-isolate as a precaution.
TheJournal.ie asked Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan at Thursday’s Covid-19 briefing if IVF is deemed an essential medical reason to travel, and how long people should restrict their movements for when they return to Ireland.
He replied: “I would hope that anybody in that situation is under the care and direction of a consultant or clinician in this country who would be perfectly well able to understand not just the public health advice, but how it should apply to a particular individual in a particular clinical context.
“And if an individual is worried or concerned about what advice they should be following they should speak to their own consultants.”
Holohan said clinicians in Ireland will understand and interpret public health advice and “provide that to an individual who need individualised advice about their specific circumstances”.
“So anybody in this situation, who is seeking treatment outside of the country, I would hope that’s under the direction of a clinician in this country, to whom they should speak about how best to protect themselves and manage the risks that might arise for them.”
Many of the people who undergo fertility treatment abroad, including Emma, are not under the care of a consultant here.
TheJournal.ie sought further clarification from the Department of Health and the Department of Transport on the issue.
A DOH spokesperson said this: “Decisions as to what constitutes essential reasons for medical travel have to be judged on an individual clinical basis. If an individual is concerned about what advice they should be following, they should speak to their own consultants.”
The government’s latest travel advice can be read here.
PCR test
It was confirmed during the week that from midnight on 29 November, under new guidelines, travellers arriving into Ireland from so-called ‘red’ regions in the EU (most European countries) can move freely once they pass a PCR Covid-19 test five days following their arrival.
This provision will also be available to arrivals from orange regions who may not have availed of a pre-departure test. You can read more about the traffic light system here.
“Obviously, the new guidelines this week were welcome but they won’t apply to me this time. What Covid brings to everyone is uncertainty and that includes those of us doing IVF,” Emma said.
When she has to revisit Prague in a few months, Emma said she will try to get a PCR test when she returns but, even if it is negative, her employers have said she will likely be unable to work as she deals with the public every day so they don’t want to take that risk. She works as a contractor and will need to take more unpaid leave.

Helen Browne, co-founder of the National Infertility Support and Information Group (NISIG), said other women are in the same position as Emma.
“It’s very very tough on people at the moment with Covid-19,” she told TheJournal.ie.
Browne said some people will want to keep the fact they are undergoing fertility treatment abroad private, but those who are upfront with their boss often have to take unpaid leave.
Some women will be able to use holiday leave, but this isn’t always an option. 
“It’s very difficult to get paid leave, the employer will probably say it has to be unpaid leave, rather than giving them paid leave,” Browne said.
“They have two weeks of wage or salary not given to them, an added expense on top of everything that they’re going through.”
Some women who undergo fertility treatment abroad attend a clinic that is linked to a clinic in Ireland, but many do not have a clinician based here.
“A lot of them go independently,” she said, so they can’t consult with a doctor here about what they should do in terms of restricting their movements.
Browne said people want more clarity on the right thing to do.
She said she’s aware of women having to stay abroad for longer than they typically would because of reduced flights.
“They now have to stay for about a week, rather than two or three days, because of the reduced flights. They’re actually having to pay more money for accommodation.
“Normally if they’re going abroad for a few days, their partner would go with them. But now because the partner can’t take a week off, most likely can’t take two weeks off, they can’t go with them. It’s really tough all round, they’re all on their own over there as well.”
Time is a factor 
It’s hard to get an accurate figure of how many people from Ireland travel abroad for fertility treatment each year but it’s believed to be in the hundreds.

Most people choose to go to the Czech Republic, Browne noted, but others go to countries such as Spain.
She said some people have chosen to delay their treatment but that this is not an option for everyone.
“Unfortunately, some people that go abroad for treatments are told that their ovarian reserve is dropping, and they feel now that they can go.
“By the time they get a chance to go, they’ll have no choice but to go for donor egg. Whereas they would like to have the opportunity of using their own eggs before they embark on donor eggs if they have to.
“If somebody said to me, I’m 39 now and by the time I get to go I’ll be 40, by the time I had my baby, if I’m lucky, I’ll be 41. That’s two years added on.”
The older a woman is when she becomes pregnant, the higher the risk in terms of complications, and many people need more than one round of IVF to become pregnant.
‘It’s a huge undertaking’
During IVF, mature eggs are collected from ovaries and fertilised by sperm in a lab. The fertilised egg or eggs are transferred into the uterus.
One full cycle of IVF takes about three weeks, but can take longer. It may take several rounds of IVF – sometimes over the course of years and costing tens of thousands of euro – for a person to become pregnant, if it’s successful.
“When you decide to do IVF at all it’s a huge undertaking, physically, emotionally and of course financially,” Emma told us.
She said she made the decision to undergo IVF before the Covid-19 pandemic and, over the course of the first lockdown, decided to go abroad for financial reasons.
“We decided to do IVF earlier this year but could not get over the cost of it in Ireland. While saving for a house it just seemed completely out of reach financially.”
Emma did some research online and joined a number of social media support groups, and found out that Prague “seemed to be a place that was affordable and also offered a good medical service”.
“We knew it would be a risk and would mean I would be travelling alone a lot of the time, but when your heart is set on starting a family, you’ll push and push until you find a way.”
Emma said the Irish government should fund fertility treatment so people like her don’t have to travel abroad.
“We are a modern country with an advanced healthcare system and so many more people going for IVF. It’s just prohibitive in its cost as it stands.”
Cancelled flights
Emma was in Prague for her first round of treatment during the week. She said the service was “great” but the overall experience was stressful.
“I’ve just had my first trip to Prague to a great clinic there, but the added layer of having to book flights, presuming they weren’t going to be cancelled, then constantly watching the government advice on international travel and Covid isolation periods was a huge source of stress.
“I’m back now but I have to take two weeks off work to isolate and that’s a tricky thing to do.”
Emma is concerned that if increased restrictions are introduced early next year, she may be unable to travel to Prague.

“This is what really worries me. It will be another few months before I go back for the next round of treatment and I’m really worried that international travel will be banned, we might be in a strict lockdown or the same thing could be happening in Prague.
“What if I have appointments and flights booked and I have to cancel? It’s a hugely stressful time as you have to follow strict hormone protocols for this kind of treatment, so Covid is a very unwelcome complication.”
Publicly-funded IVF in Ireland
Health Minister Stephen Donnelly spoke about plans for a publicly-funded IVF system in Ireland, as set out in the Programme for Government, in the Dáil earlier this month.
“This model of care will ensure that infertility issues will be addressed through the public health system at the lowest level of clinical intervention necessary,” Donnelly said.
He noted that the plan will comprise three stages, starting in primary care (GPs) and extending into secondary care (regional fertility hubs) and then, where necessary, tertiary care (IVF and other advanced assisted human reproduction (AHR) treatments).
“Structured referral pathways will be put in place and patients will be referred onwards for further investigations or treatment as required and as clinically appropriate. It is intended that, in line with available resources, this model of care for infertility will be rolled out on a phased basis over the course of the coming years,” Donnelly said.
“The implementation of the model of care will help to ensure the provision of safe, effective and accessible infertility services at all levels of the public health system as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology,” he added.
Browne believes it will take “quite a few years” for publicly funded fertility treatment to be available in Ireland – making it too late for many people.
She said a part-funded model is more likely – where investigations and blood tests may be paid for by the State.
“I personally cannot see the model in the UK, or in other countries where they will fund for two or three IVF cycles, here. I don’t know, maybe way down the line.”
Guidelines in the UK recommend that IVF is offered on the NHS to women under the age of 40 who have not conceived after two years of regular unprotected sex, or who have had 12 cycles of artificial insemination. These women should be offered three full cycles of IVF, the guidelines say.
In women aged 40–42 years, the guidelines say they should be offered one full cycle of IVF, once certain criteria is met.
Advice and support can be found on the NISIG’s website.

Such was the extent of the back and knee problems he carried into the game, he started his warm-up two hours and 15 minutes before throw-in began to ensure he could take the field.
“I don’t want to finish like that. Maybe it’s a good thing. Probably that decision I would have had to make in the winter has probably been made already for me. So I think I owe it to myself to do whatever I can to play again.”
When he woke up this morning, Hogan was surely thanking his lucky stars he decided to throw his lot in for 2020. In a way the pandemic worked in his favour, giving his body some much-needed rest after a relentless 15 years on the inter-county hamster wheel.
“He got a break, the body got a break. I firmly believe that and I would have said it to him as well,” said Brian Cody.
“Because he’s a player, he doesn’t hold back when he’s injured. He won’t just lie down, even for a serious enough injury. He’ll keep going. He’s a fighter. So he hasn’t minded the body from the point of view of sitting back when he’s injured, ‘I can’t play’. He’s not like that. He always wants to play and definitely he’s moving freely.”  
On a night where Kilkenny’s twin tower pairing of Colin Fennelly and Walter Walsh were tied down by the Galway rearguard, Cody looked to his bench and summoned the 2014 Hurler of the Year.
He arrived into the Leinster final on 44 minutes and initially took a while before he dialled up to the temperature of the game. Hogan’s first decisive impact was with a deft handpass for Martin Keoghan’s shot that whistled narrowly wide of Eanna Murphy’s goal. 
Galway dealt with the high ball all night, but Kilkenny started to find some joy when the ball was sprayed in low in front of Hogan. Galway had ruled the skies, only for Hogan to take the fight to the ground.
When Kilkenny needed him most, he grabbed the game by the scruff of the neck. He had no right to win the ball that went into the danger zone, using all his genius to somehow control it and set himself up for a volleyed finish.
What made it most impressive was that he made it look so easy, like a youngster messing about with his mates in the schoolyard.
Daithi Burke, Eanna Murphy, Shane Cooney and Gearoid McInerney were left looking on in amazement.
“I’d say it was more Richie brought something different to the full-forward line to what was actually happening,” said Galway boss Shane O’Neill.
“It was just that small spell really with the two very quick goals and that’s something we’ll have to look at.”

Hogan’s movement created space for Reid in front of the D. The Ballyhale maestro sidestepped Joseph Cooney and there was only going to be one outcome as he bore down on Murphy’s goal.

From five points behind to one in front in a matter of seconds. Kilkenny have lost none of their ruthless streak.
There was still time for more Hogan heroics as Galway retook the lead. He got himself in behind the Tribe rearguard again, flashing a strike just over the bar. Judging by his reaction, he had goal on his mind once again.
Fittingly, Hogan had the last say. His 71st minute point from way out on the Cusack Stand side was ambitious, but this was his night. He knew it was over a long time before it sailed between the posts.
“That’s what substitutes are for,” said Cody. “If you bring in a player, if at all possible it’s to make an impact, to make a difference. I think it’s fair to say they did that.
“Richie was very influential, there’s no doubt about that when he came in,” he continued.
“You’re talking about a real experienced player and a player who has given great service for certain. It’s terrific that Richie has had an uninterrupted kind of a year with injury.
“He’s one of the players in the country who has benefited from the lack of competitive games over the year because he’s had a free run to get injury free and he definitely contributed really, really powerfully when he came on.”
No Kilkenny man will ever say winning a Leinster final makes up for an All-Ireland defeat, but there’s not doubting it was a redemptive moment on a personal level for Hogan.
“I mean Richie Hogan has been hurling for years at the top level and every day he goes out, he goes out to perform,” said Cody. “Was it disappointing last year?
“Of course it was disappointing last year but you can’t carry that with you forever either. He went out to perform as well as he possibly could for the team and he did that.”

At 32, Hogan is the same age as TJ Reid who is well on his way to sitting on Kilkenny’s Mount Rushmore alongside Henry Shefflin and DJ Carey.
Hogan was the prodigious underage talent and would likely have more than four All-Stars had his body not started to break down from his late 20s.
Reid was the late bloomer, who considered quitting in 2012 after repeatedly being whipped off in big games, until he blossomed into a fearsome physical specimen and dead-eye shooter.
Reid is rarely injured while Hogan has spent much of the last few seasons battling various ailments. His ability to make the ball talk has never been questioned.
Young guns like Conor Browne, Eoin Cody and Martin Keoghan certainly played their part, but Reid and Hogan were front and centre here, hitting 2-12 between them.
“They seemed to certainly create better space and that I suppose but lookit, everybody, the players who came off had worked really, really hard as well.
“It’s not a question of some lads not doing their job, the panel is there to be used and everything else. It doesn’t go brilliantly for everybody ever, but the fellas who fought and kept going and did all they could while they were there were equally as important.”
For Cody, it meant a 16th Leinster title but he was never going to look at it like that.
“It’s this year’s Leinster final. And of course it’s sweet. A lot of the players there it’s probably their first Leinster title which shows it does matter very, very much. And after all of that, we’re Leinster champions. That matters.”

Taylor dropped Gutierrez in the fourth, and had the Spaniard reeling in more rounds than she didn’t, but the incredibly durable challenger, doubtless aided by her extra size and weight on the night, weathered a blizzard of assaults to hear the final bell.
The Irish icon was almost punch-perfect in a performance which exhibited pugilistic mastery and sheer violence in equal measure, albeit a stoppage would have been the icing on the cake as she improved her record to 17-0 (6KOs). Gutierrez (now 13-1, 5KOs), who is not the punchbag that she will be made out to be by some who watched Taylor pick her apart tonight, showed other-worldly heart but barely landed a shot in anger as she suffered her first career blemish.
The 37-year-old Spaniard applauded her ‘hero’ to the stage during Friday’s weigh-in and was equally graceful in defeat, warmly applauding Taylor as MC David Diamante read the judges’ lopsided verdict. The smiling Gutierrez even helped Taylor to hold her belts for post-fight pictures — a gesture appreciated by the champion.

“I’m very, very satisfied — I thought it was a great performance,” said Taylor afterwards, wearing her own smile. “She was very, very tough. I was definitely trying my best to get her out of there at times but she just kept firing back. She was very durable. She’s obviously bigger and stronger than I was.

“Unfortunately, I just couldn’t get her out. I would have loved to have gotten the stoppage today but overall, it was a great performance.
“I never go into any fight complacent. She was actually very heavy-handed — she could punch — and when you go in complacent against those kinds of girls, that’s when you actually get beaten. So, I was very, very happy today.”
After Gutierrez strutted to the ring to a traditional Spanish tune, Taylor emerged to a jingle which would have rung a bell for those of us who binge-watched Michael Jordan documentary The Last Dance on Netflix during Lockdown 1.0: the Chicago Bulls theme tune ‘Sirius’, which was chosen by Brian Peters on account of the fact that Taylor doesn’t give enough of a hoot to pick her own entrance music.

Fittingly, Taylor charged from her corner bullishly as soon as the first bell sounded from ringside, only Gutierrez wasn’t ready to play matador so early: Taylor exploited her false sense of security with a barrage of hooks both to body and head, teeing off as her opponent floundered against the ropes. Eventually, having felt Gutierrez’s teak toughness first-hand — and second, and third, and fourth, etc — she eased off and became more calculating, but no less spiteful, with her attacks.
“It wasn’t really pre-planned”, Taylor laughed, “but I saw I hurt her in the first 30 seconds and thought I might get her out in the first round — but how wrong I was!
“She was very, very strong and I just had to take my time a bit more from then on.”
Taylor remained electric without being reckless, and by round three was having her way with the retreating Gutierrez. The signs of defiance from the challenger weren’t usually evinced through physical expression rather than with her fists; Taylor dropped a bomb of a left hook after a clever tee-up in the third which would have floored most 135-pounders only to be greeted, again, with a smile — albeit probably a sore one to pull off.

It had already worn off Gutierrez’s face during a one-sided fourth in which Taylor rubber-stamped her dominance with a picturesque knockdown of her opponent, planting a thudding straight right hand down the pipe and helping Gutierrez floorward with a follow-up jab.
The bell sounded to end the round but Gutierrez still had to prove her health to referee John Latham — and to her credit, she seemed relatively sturdy.
She found some fleeting success of her own in the fifth but the fight remained one-way traffic; a stoppage seemed to be more a case of ‘when’ than ‘if’.
Taylor had her reeling again in the sixth and continued to parade her arsenal throughout the second half, putting together two-tiered combinations that occasionally boggled the mind such was the speed and style with which they were delivered.

By the eighth, however, it began to become clear that Gutierrez was virtually indestructible; she swallowed another left hook which would have unraveled the majority of recipients and beckoned Taylor forward for more, smiling again while attempting to hold her ground in the face of rapid fire.
Taylor surely realised in the championship rounds, having banked virtually every preceding entry, that her opponent couldn’t be beaten into submission. But she tried anyway, probably largely for her own enjoyment as well as her hundreds of thousands of fans watching live on Sky Sports and their social-media channels at home.
“I caught her with some great shots but credit to her — she’s very, very tough; very durable,” she said afterwards. “It was a great fight.”

Responding to suggestions in the build-up that she might not have been in optimal physical condition considering the grueling nature of her previous fight with rival Delfine Persoon, which took place only three months ago, Taylor replied: “I felt great. I went back to Connecticut straight away after my last fight to start training with Ross [Enamait] and we knew, we wouldn’t have taken this fight if we didn’t think we were going to be in great shape.
“It was a very, very busy year for me training-wise but I think I perform best when I’m actually fighting regularly; I’d fight every month if I could — if Eddie would let me!” she laughed, before nodding in the direction of promoter Eddie Hearn.
“We’ll talk after!” she added.","The Irish icon dropped Miriam Gutierrez and hurt in her several rounds but had to settle for an almost-perfect unanimous decision.",67,0,0,119611,"Nov 14th 2020, 11:37 PM"

The response was overwhelming – over 2,500 entries were received. 
The stories created a picture of Irish life in microcosm, from funny moments to sad stories, to proud memories. A Page from My Life gathers 150 of these stories, both fiction and non-fiction – and it has been nominated in the TheJournal.ie-sponsored Best Irish Published Book of the Year category at the An Post Irish Book Awards.
Here are three of the non-fiction stories you’ll find in the book. Have a tissue handy…
Keeping in Touch, by Frances Harney
I’m fiddling with the tuning dial, trying to reconnect with RTÉ Radio 1 and a Richard Ford interview. ‘Bloody thing keeps sliding out of tune,’ I complain, more to myself than to Liam.
Suddenly the ancient transistor surges into clarity: ‘A marriage only survives if you can keep the conversation going,’ the writer declares authoritatively. 
My reclining husband rouses into voice: ‘What a load of rubbish!’ I wasn’t sure if he was referring to this eminent author or the actual radio set. ‘Everyone’s an expert on everything these days. Who wants a “surviving marriage” anyway? Does he mean a “living marriage”?’
I was about to answer, but he had already drawn his own conclusion. ‘I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, words only serve to confuse understanding!’ Liam has never
been a big conversationalist. The transmission fades to an unintelligible whirr. I feel him smiling beneath the discarded T-shirt he has placed over his face. I click the dial, and we lapse into a lazy silence.
We are lying semi-naked in the ‘den’, Liam in his illfitting boxers and me in my mismatched bra and knickers. We are lying in the sun, together, apart. This summer
practice is now in its 38th year. With closed eyes, we bathe in the warmth, sheltered in our ‘sanctum sanctorum’.
 
Our cadenced breathing attunes to nature’s own voices, humming, buzzing, chirping, singing, translucent in harmony. I drift on sounds of grazing cattle in nearby fields. Snippets of conversations carry on memory’s wavelengths – my mother’s voice – ‘Do you think she’ll marry him?’ My father’s tones resonant and decisive.
‘They’re a total mismatch, him and his motorbikes, her and her books. He’s a townie, she’s a country girl. I don’t even know if he goes to Mass. You’ll have to talk to her.’
The petal touch of Liam’s hand on mine draws me back to the present – skin on skin – and I reawaken. His gentleness talks as our fingers intertwine, reaffirming his promise ‘to take my hand’. We stretch palm to palm, reciprocating tenderness – ‘I take thee.’ He rhythmically strokes the moist folds to my fingertips turning my dial, megahertz spinning – ‘to love and to cherish’.
His thumb caresses my palm with perfect frequency. I cup it and thrill at its firmness within my soft embrace – ‘to have and to hold’. Our hands pulsating in the most
ancient of all languages copulate in scintillating communion. My heart bursts into full bloom – ‘for all of our lives’.

No words to confuse understanding as these two hands fit one into the other, perfectly matched, each bathing in the warmth of the other, totally satisfied.
These hands, snug in their snuggery, have held each other through births and deaths, disappointments and joys, sickness and health, good times and bad. If marriage survives on conversation, it lives on the language of the touch of love. No need for fine-tuning.
The reception is strong with conversations that will last a lifetime.
Two Things, by Eoin Pól Ó Rúis
There were two things I had to say that weekend, to confess. No – to tell, not confess; after all, I’d left those days behind. It’s tempting to say, ‘that was a different me,’ but I have always thought people dispense this phrase too readily, too easily. In my case, it wasn’t a different me.
As I sat on the edge of the chair in my bedsit on North Circular Road, puffed with pride at how far I had come, I was still the same me. The same me that made a decision on a balmy summer’s evening in Piazza della Repubblica, the sunset glittering through the frolicking fountain, piercing bubbles in glasses of prosecco on the tables underneath the stage whilst Rome’s equivalent of Frank Sinatra crooned ‘I Did It My Way’. It was precisely at that moment that I knew. After months of doubt verging on despair, I suddenly realised what I needed to do. That evening, I packed my bags and turned my back on the seminary, turned my back on five years of studying for the priesthood. A whole new life lay before me.
And here I was. I had found a job in Dublin and felt that I had begun to put down some semblance of roots. The Catholic Church didn’t exactly cultivate the needs of the individual; you were part of a collective, a bigger picture, living a communal life. You can imagine then the joy and freedom for me having a place of my own. And, as I turned the key in the big red door and headed towards the city centre, I knew I had made the
right decision. There were just these last things I wanted to – no – I needed to tell.
My mother was already there, standing outside Bewley’s Oriental Café, keenly watching the world go by, cigarette in hand. Meeting up on a Saturday was a regular occurrence, as she would often spend the weekend at my brother’s place in Drogheda and we would meet up in the Big Smoke for a latte and a squishy bun. I never led her to believe that today was any different but, as we hugged, I noticed an extra glint in her eye. It was almost as if she knew.
We went in and sank into a big red booth. 
‘I’m gay,’ I announced before her coat was off.
‘I know,’ she said. ‘You might as well tell me your hair’s a different colour. It doesn’t make a difference. I love you. I love you as you are, as God made you.’
My heart exploded in gratitude and tears slid down my face. She held my hand and listened and listened and listened . . .
Suddenly, she jumped up. ‘Oh, my God, what time is it? We’ll miss Mass!’
I couldn’t bring myself to tell her my second secret, that I no longer went to church. Judging by her smile as we sat into the pews of St Teresa’s, though, I guessed she already knew.
She, by Kate Durrant
It’s easy to pass 25 years.
It flies by in a blur of school and work and the mundane busyness that is the bread and butter of day to day life.
Of tiny teeth left under sleepy pillows, of parties and chickenpox, and children with bit parts as angels in Christmas concerts.
Of shepherd’s pie every Tuesday, of homemade cards too precious to ever discard, and slammed doors and broken teenage hearts.
The good times resonate, the bad times less so, although undoubtedly they are the times that shape us more.

The first step, the first time a tiny hand clasps yours, the first time you hear that most beautiful of words: ‘Mammy’. 
All those firsts, all those little miracles, all those long days and short years, bring us all too soon to our goodbyes.
Those of us lucky enough to have kept our children, to still have them in our lives, to have with them the relationship we had always wished but at times never dared hope for, get the privilege to say goodbye as they shed us and grow their new skin.
 
The dramas of life, at the time so terrible, now become the anecdotes of Christmas Day lunches and wedding day speeches.
And it’s true to say that the drama that temporarily divided us along the way is the same drama than binds us so tightly now.
So today I say farewell to her, my first-born, my best, and toughest, of teachers, as she moves away and properly loosens the ties that bind us.
She who must go and make her own firsts, her own wonderful mistakes and huge triumphs.
She who taught me that others’ opinions and thoughts were theirs and theirs alone.
She with the big, beautiful heart, and the ability and will to change lives.
She who will always try to do the right thing when doing the wrong is easier.
She who passionately stands up for those who cannot stand up for themselves.
And as she moves away into a life that is only beginning to reveal itself, I hope that she learns to be as kind to herself as she is to others. 
That she learns early, and often, that it’s OK to say no, and remains true to what she really believes in but is open to the truths of others.
That she takes pleasure in the minutiae of life, for therein lies the really important stuff, and that she finds love and great friendships and gives them her all, as love never grows in a cold climate.
I hold back my tears and wave as she passes through the portal of passport control and I offer up a silent prayer that she will always remember that whatever and whoever comes to pass, the door to my heart and my home, to the heart of she who loved her first, is only ever the turn of a key away.

Galway 0-24
KILKENNY UNDER BRIAN Cody just never know when they’re beaten.
When Jason Flynn extended Galway’s lead to five in the 55th minute, they looked like a side ready to power home. But the introduction of former Hurler of the Year Richie Hogan helped turn the tide back in Kilkenny’s favour as they pulled off a late comeback in stunning fashion.
On a night when Galway’s full-back line dominated under the high ball, the diminutive forward gave the Tribesmen something different to think about. 
His goal sparked the Kilknny comeback and seconds later TJ Reid added a second goal to turn this contest on its head. Hogan has battled injury over the past few years but he looked back to his very best here and performed heroics after he was sent on.
Hogan’s green flag was a thing of beauty, using four touches to take the ball past Eanna Murphy, flick it up, control it and bat tennis-style into the net. The only pity is there wasn’t 20-odd thousand Kilkenny supporters in the ground to witness it.
He was centimetres away from adding a second green flag minutes later and set-up Martin Keoghan for a golden goal opportunity earlier in the half. Hogan had to be content with 1-2 as Kilkenny stole their first provincial crown since 2016 at the death. 
Galway retook the lead after two each from Joe Canning and David Burke, but it was the Cats who finished stronger for Cody’s 16th Leinster victory.
Shane O’Neill left Croke Park tonight wondering just how he failed to up his first piece of silverware as Galway manager. For the first three-quarters to the game they looked the superior side with the crossfield ball into Conor Whelan causing havoc.
For long spells the game descended into a battle between freetakers Reid and Canning.

Galway were punished for 12 wides, compared to five from Kilkenny. Despite his 14-point haul, the narrow margin of defeat meant Canning was left to rue a stoppage-time free that struck the post and an earlier 20m free that was saved on the line.
Cody avoided losing a third successive Leinster final for the first time in his career with a comeback that typified the Kilkenny spirit. 
He made four change from the Dublin clash, introducing Tommy Walsh, Conor Browne, Richie Leahy and Conor Fogarty. Walsh was assigned on Brian Concannon and largely kept the in-form sharpshooter under wraps.
Galway are physically an impressive unit and their defenders were well able to deal with Kilkenny’s aerial bombardment towards Walter Walsh, Colin Fennelly and TJ Reid. Walsh and Fennelly found themselves replaced by the 51st minute with the latter unusually quiet.
Even Reid didn’t have quite his typical impact from open play until his final quarter goal.
From the outset Galway withdrew Canning to midfield and used Padraig Mannion as an auxiliary centre-back,. Joseph Cooney was instructed to follow Reid all over the field – just like he did with Lee Chin in the semi-final.
Galway had the better spread of scorers in the first-half. Conor Whelan buzzed about, causing problems whenever the ball went near him. He stripped Conor Delaney and shot over the bar for his first score, catching a stray handpass and doing likewise for his second.

Kilkenny relied largely on frees from Reid, who converted all eight of his attempts in the opening period. The direct ball into the full-forward didn’t quite stick and this was summed up by Cooney’s majestic catch over Reid near the end of the half. 
Canning played a glorious sideline into Joseph Cooney’s path for one of the scores of the game and Galway might have added a goal 10 minutes before the break. Niall Burke fetched above Huw Lawlor but the Kilkenny full-back held onto his hurley as Burke attempted to race through on goal.
It was the sort of cynical play by Lawlor that will lead to further discussion around the introduction of a black card into hurling.
Canning popped over the free and added a lovely effort from the sideline, his second from play, to leave the Tribesmen leading 0-13 to 0-12 at the interval.
Canning hit Galway’s opening five scores after the break, while substitute Jason Flynn went close to adding a goal after he burned Lawlor for pace down the flank. 
Trailing by four, Kilkenny went desperately close to hitting the net before the water break when Richie Hogan – introduced moments earlier – split open the Galway defence with a handpass but Martin Keoghan’s strike sailed just wide.
Flynn extended the lead to five and then the most extraordinary 60 seconds of play unfolded. Richie Hogan’s quick reactions saw the Dansefort ace hit the net and as soon as Galway could draw their breath, Reid sped through rifled into the top corner.

That sent Kilkenny in front, but two from Canning and a brace from replacement David Burke left Galway two ahead. Yet again, Kilkenny fought back. They scored the final four points of the game, including two from Hogan, to steal the cup at the death.

Mohsin Kamal came to Ireland in March 2016. After working in Kilkenny, Letterkenny and Cork hospitals, he’s now an infectious disease registrar (a mid-ranking hospital doctor) at Crumlin Children’s Hospital in Dublin.
He aims to be a fully-trained consultant, and to carry out research into infectious diseases, but he is now unsure if Ireland is the place to do it. 
Kamal has said that the process for non-EU doctors to apply for training to become consultants is difficult, with extra qualifications needed to apply, and a preference for EU doctors above others when applications are being assessed. 
A recent Bill, the Regulated Professions (Health and Social Care) Amendment Bill 2020, now signed into law as an Act, aims to give greater access to non-EU doctors to train here.
Previously, the Irish Medical Council only recognised internships from eight countries as being equivalent to an Irish/EU internship – these are Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, Sudan, Malaysia, Malta and the UK.
This meant that many non-EU doctors needed to prove that their internship was the equivalent of an Irish internship with a Certificate of Experience in order to be eligible for Trainee Specialist registration, which prevented many from advancing their careers, with many leaving the country.
Now, the Irish Medical Council says doctors with non-EU internships “who are appropriately qualified and have established eligibility for General Registration”, but without initial Irish basic medical training, will be eligible to apply for Specialist Training.
But Kamal says that this won’t affect the vast majority of non-EU doctors here, and there are still other hurdles for non-EU doctors in attempting to apply for specialist training in Ireland – such as access to a PRES 2 exam not being available in Ireland, and EU doctors being prioritised for Specialist Training.
Everyone thinks it’s a big congratulations thing and it’s a big achievement for us. But in reality, it’s nothing beneficial for [most non-EU doctors.] I was eligible when I came to Ireland, but I cannot get to train here because of the [other] rules.
Kamal says he wants to stay in Ireland, but he has to make a decision for his career.
The process for applying for Specialist Training
An estimated 43% of Ireland’s doctors have graduated outside of Ireland, according to an Irish Medical Council report.
The Irish Medical Council also says that in 2018, doctors from countries outside of the EU cumulatively contributed more new entrants to the Irish register of medical practitioners than Ireland did.
Source: Irish Medical Council
In Ireland there are two training schemes: the Basic Specialist Training (BST) which is two years long, and Higher Specialist Training (HST) which is five years long. 
In order to be eligible for BST, a doctor in Ireland needs to do an internship for one year (the Bill mentioned above deals with this), and they need to register for the Irish Medical Council. After this, EU graduates can apply directly for training.
Non-EU doctors have a few extra steps before registering. They need to do Pre-Registration Examination System (PRES) exams: PRES 1, PRES 2, and PRES 3. 
The Irish Medical Council said that all non-EU qualified doctors are required to pass or be exempt from the PRES, and the recent changes in law don’t change this requirement.
There is no facility to allow doctors to sit the PRES 2 exam in Ireland according to Kamal, so many will do the UK (PLAB) or US (USMLE) equivalent.
In response to questions from TheJournal.ie, the Irish Medical Council said that they were phasing out the PRES 2 exam “in favour of recognising a number of international tests of clinical knowledge” and that this “made PRES easier for applicants to apply for registration”.
“…Between the four overseas exams, there are now hundreds of test centres around the world in which the computer-based exam can be undertaken,” it said of PRES 2.
A PRES 3 exam, a clinical skills exam based on the main clinical disciplines of obstetrics and gynaecology, paediatrics, psychiatry, surgery, and general practice, can be done in Ireland – but is currently on hold due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Once these tests are passed, they can apply for Specialist Training programmes – but will only be considered for a post after any EU candidate who applies. This has been cited before as a strain on non-EU doctors who wish to further their training as consultants. 
Kamal said:
If there are 29 positions and 30 applicants, if one of them is from Pakistan and the rest of the 29 candidates are from Ireland and the Europe, and the fully-qualified doctor from Pakistan gave a great interview and his CV was brilliant… he will not be given the opportunity to get training.
An Irish Medical Council report cited a non-EU doctor, who said that “it’s incredibly hard for non-EU doctors who graduated from Irish medical college… to get onto HST because of ‘EU first’ rule and policy.”

Responses from the Irish Medical Council and the IMO 
In a statement, a spokesperson for the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) said that the Regulated Professions (Health and Social Care) Amendment Bill 2019 was “a first step in ensuring that all doctors, regardless of their country of medical education, will have the opportunity to compete for a training scheme position in Ireland”.
“Meaningful access to training scheme positions for non-EU international doctors is only possible with a significant expansion of training scheme positions.
In our most recent presentation before the Oireachtas Health Committee regarding medical workforce planning, the IMO spoke about the need to increase our consultant, GP, public health and overall medical workforce.
The IMO told that Oireachtas hearing that there are around 500 vacant consultant posts, which is contributing to growing hospital waiting lists, now at over 840,000 people.
To future-proof our service, one of the things that we need to do is to train more of those doctors who are already working in, and familiar with, the health service in this country.
“We do not believe the Act will create increased difficulty for those who would otherwise be able to register with the Irish Medical Council on the basis of their recognised internship qualification.
“Regarding the PRES examination, we do understand that due to Covid-19, parts of this exam have been more difficult to achieve. This is unrelated to the Act.”
The Irish Medical Council gave the following statement to a similar number of issues raised:
“One of main barriers to accessing postgraduate training for non-EU qualified doctors, has been the requirement to have been granted the equivalent of a Certificate of Experience, ie, the doctor’s internship needs to be considered the equivalent of an Irish internship, in order to be eligible for Trainee Specialist registration, which is a requisite for entry into a training programme.”
The Medical Council said that it has “long sought amendments” to the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, and that the Act amends the five health professional regulatory Acts, including the Medical Practitioners Act. 
A key amendment contained in this Act is the removal of the requirement to have the equivalence of a certificate of experience for registration in the Trainee Specialist Division (TSD), opening access to doctors who are appropriately qualified and have established eligibility for General Registration, but without initial Irish basic medical training.
“This means all non-EU qualified doctors will have access to the TSD once they establish eligibility for general registration.”
In relation to English language requirements, nothing will change. Non-EU qualified doctors who are not EU citizens will still be asked to provide evidence of communication skills in the exact same way as is currently in place.
The Medical Council said that it’s hoped that with better access to progress their education and training, less doctors will leave the country because of this.","The Irish Medical Council said that it hoped recent changes in law would prompt more doctors to stay in Ireland to pursue specialist training here.",13,0,1,30768,"Nov 14th 2020, 8:00 PM"

Colourful, sealed sarcophagi and statues that were buried more than 2,500 years ago were displayed in a makeshift exhibit at the foot of the famed Step Pyramid of Djoser at Saqqara.
Archaeologists opened a coffin with a well-preserved mummy wrapped in cloth inside. They also X‐rayed the structures of the ancient mummy, showing how the body had been preserved.
Tourism and antiquities minister Khaled el-Anany told a news conference that the discovered items date back to the Ptolemaic dynasty that ruled Egypt for 300 years — from around 320BC to about 30BC, and the Late Period (664-332BC).
He said experts would move the artefacts to at least three Cairo museums including the Grand Egyptian Museum which is being built near the famed Giza Pyramids. He added that they would announce another discovery at the Saqqara necropolis later this year.
The discovery is the latest in a series of archaeological finds in Egypt. Since September, antiquities authorities have revealed at least 140 sealed sarcophagi, with mummies inside most of them, in the same area of Saqqara.
Egyptian archaeologists found other “shafts full of coffins, well-gilded, well-painted, well-decorated”, Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, told reporters today.

714,200,"Over 1 billion Indians celebrate Diwali amid pandemic and pollution fears",https://www.thejournal.ie/india-diwali-celebrations-5266963-Nov2020/,"MORE THAN A billion Indians have celebrated Diwali amid concern over a resurgence in coronavirus infections and rising air pollution that is enveloping the country’s north in a cloud of thick toxic smog.
Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, is typically celebrated by socialising and exchanging gifts with friends and family, as well as lighting oil lamps or candles to symbolise a victory of light over darkness. Fireworks are also a major part of the celebrations.
But this year, the pandemic is upending some of the festivities in India, particularly in the capital New Delhi, which has seen a renewed spike in coronavirus infections in recent weeks, recording more new cases than any other Indian state.
Today,  many temples across the country streamed prayer sessions online to avoid large gatherings. In New Delhi, worried residents opted for low-key celebrations.
Some even stayed at home and did not visit friends or relatives.
“It’s not the usual Diwali,” said Vishwas Malik, 47, a professor in New Delhi.
“The exchange of gifts is less and we have not interacted with people. We have not visited people’s homes because of the fear of the coronavirus.”
In a bid to encourage people to stay home, New Delhi’s chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, and some of his ministers held a prayer ceremony at a grand temple.
The prayers were broadcast on television and social media.
Mr Kejriwal said last week that the pandemic was spreading fast in the capital due to the rising air pollution.
He appealed to people to not burst firecrackers on Diwali, in the hopes of mitigating the harmful effect of toxic air on those who are more vulnerable during the pandemic.

Firecrackers often cause spikes in New Delhi’s notoriously bad pollution.
The link between air pollution and worsening Covid-19 cases remains theoretical at the moment. But several researchers have said that in addition to factors such as mask-wearing, social distancing, population density and temperature, poor air quality should also be considered a key element in coronavirus outbreaks.

India has confirmed 8.7 million cases of the coronavirus, including 129,000 deaths. While it is second in the world for total cases behind the US, daily infections have been on the decline since the middle of September.
Shoppers in New Delhi had been packing markets across the country, prompting concerns among health experts who warned that crowded celebrations could cause a virus resurgence that could batter India’s healthcare system.
But ahead of Diwali, messages encouraging people to stay home during the festival spread around the city via WhatsApp.
“This Diwali is more about survival. It is about being grateful that we are still able to breathe and be alive for this day. Please stay home,” read one such message.

Cork 1-17
ATER A WRETCHED night in Limerick, the All-Ireland champions Tipperary are still standing after digging out a qualifier win over Cork in a rousing fashion.

A tough and uncompromising battle ensued in the Gaelic Grounds with the issue only truly settled when Jake Morris accelerated clear to clinically despatch a goal in the 68th minute. That pushed Tipperary four clear, the same margin between the teams at the finish after they had subsequently traded white flags.
Morris gets the plaudits for the well-placed shot but the piece of skill by Willie Connors to gather possession and offload was crucial in splitting open the Cork defence.
The game unfolded on a day of brutal weather in Limerick. The cascading showers and howling winds were at Tipperary’s back in the first half yet that perceived advantage was not truly reflected on the scoreboard. They won the scoring count by two in that opening period, 0-9 to 1-4, and were also emphatic victors in the wide count, 12 to 3, which signalled the difficulties they were enduring in their attacking play.
The critical early score arrived in the 22nd minute. A scrum for possession developed in the middle third, Michael Breen popped a handpass back that had slightly too much on it and Patrick Horgan intervened to steal the sliotar. After turning, he suddenly discovered Tipperary’s defence had been completely pulled out of shape and was able to coast through from 60 yards.
Niall O’Meara desperately tried to get back to execute a hook with Jack O’Connor being minded by Cathal Barrett closer to goal and Horgan kept his composure to drill a low left-handed shot past the dive of Brian Hogan. The goal energised Cork and gave them a firm foothold in the match.

But Tipperary pounced for a pair of goals themselves into the Clare End of the stadium. That Morris late strike was the match-winner while Jason Forde careered in from the right wing in a smart fashon for the 41st minute goal that ignited them after a previously listless showing.
Tipperary’s third-quarter play was much improved with their talisman Séamus Callanan more prominent while Michael Breen was the scoring sensation throughout in picking off 0-5 from play in his midfield display. It was 1-12 to 1-7 in Tipperary’s favour by the 43rd minute but inspired by Séamus Harnedy, who finished with 0-4, Cork clawed back some of that deficit.
They trailed 1-13 to 1-11 at the second-half water break and had edged in front 1-15 to 1-14 by the 60th minute mark. In a tight and tense finish the Morris goal was crucial while substitutes Connors and Paul Flynn also made their presence felt. Tipperary’s defence was outstanding in the closing stages to prolong their season for another week at least.
Scorers for Tipperary: Jason Forde 1-6 (0-5f), Michael Breen 0-5, Jake Morris 1-0, Dan McCormack, Séamus Callanan, Paul Flynn 0-2 each, Willie Connors 0-1.
Scorers for Cork: Patrick Horgan 1-8 (0-7f, 0-1 ’65), Séamus Harnedy 0-4, Tim O’Mahony, Bill Cooper, Shane Kingston, Robbie O’Flynn, Declan Dalton 0-1 each.

IRELAND BOSS Stephen Kenny insists he is not getting too downhearted, despite last Thursday’s 3-0 loss to England extending his team’s winless run to six games since taking over.
A first defeat to the Three Lions in 35 years was a setback, but Kenny says the upcoming Nations League fixtures have always been the priority.
“I think everyone was disappointed to lose against England. It was a difficult game playing England in Wembley — Ireland have never won in Wembley, we wanted to try to achieve that. 
“They’re in good form and it’s probably the first match we’ve played that we’ve been not in the ascendancy for a lot of the game. We were disappointed to lose the game, but you’ve got a quick turn-around. 
“The Nations League games were the greater priority overall with points at stake, so we’ve got to focus on Wales tomorrow and Bulgaria on Wednesday.”
In addition to some disappointing results, Kenny has been unfortunate to lose a number of important players, both in this international window and the last one, due to injury and Covid-related absences.
The manager acknowledged it was a problem, but said he didn’t want it to look as if he was making excuses.
It has been a tough period, I won’t deny that, last month and this month in relation to all that has gone on, but I’m not complaining about that, you have got to deal with it and that is part of where we are now. We have got to dust ourselves down quickly and make sure we are really positive today in training and make sure we are ready for tomorrow. That’s important.
“Every single player going out wants to earn every cap, every cap when they play is important to them, so the chance to represent their country is a big ambition for them all. We know it’s a tough game in Wales tomorrow, we know they are on a great run, but we want to go and try to win the game.
“I’m not pleased that we haven’t scored, I’m disappointed that we haven’t scored in the last few games and we did a collage of the opportunities that we had over the previous four games, leaving the England game out, and we watched it together collectively, I said we missed a very, very high number of chances, but we were creating chances.

With some many players ruled out, Kenny has had the opportunity to blood a couple of youngsters, including 21-year-old centre-back Dara O’Shea, after he earned his second cap against England.
When you think about a mentality, Dara is an example of the kind of mentality that you would want an Irish player to have, because he’s gone on loan to the the Southern Premier League with Hereford first of all, then gone and played 30-odd games for Exeter in League Two, before he went to West Brom and played a part in their promotion-winning season, and now he’s played some games in the Premier League.
“He’s been a consistent improver over the age groups and he’s a very god young professional.”
Like O’Shea, Jason Knight is another player Kenny previously worked with in the Ireland U21 set-up, and it was confirmed today that the Derby youngster had been promoted to the senior squad.
Asked about the decision, which meant Knight would have to be miss the U21 side’s crucial upcoming qualifiers, Kenny said: “Well, Jason is not here to make up the numbers. We may have included him before now, but we didn’t want to include him to sit in the stand when he could be playing for the U21s in an important qualifier. 
“But this is the senior international team, that’s the purpose of under-age set-up, to produce players for the senior international team.
“He’s only 19 and he’s made his debut in Finland — again playing every week in the Championship for Derby County, and he’s got tremendous drive for one so young.”","The Ireland boss has seen a number of important players ruled out of late.",1,0,0,22319,"Nov 14th 2020, 4:50 PM"

Trump expressed his thanks and suggested he might “stop by and say hello” at rallies held under the banners of “Stop The Steal,” “Million MAGA March” and “Women for America First”.
Right-wing militia groups such as the Proud Boys also planned to hold rallies, prompting a large security presence in the capital to prevent clashes with separate anti-Trump events that were scheduled outside the Supreme Court.
“The whole system’s rigged… in the way that the information is getting to the people, it’s filtered through these channels that makes it so that the truth never actually gets out,” said marcher Darion Schaublin, 26, who drove to Washington from Columbus, Ohio.
“There is a good chance… he is not going to have a second term — and I’m not sure of the legitimacy of that.”
The final two undeclared states were called yesterday by US television networks — with Democrat challenger Joe Biden winning the former Republican stronghold of Georgia in an extremely close race, and Trump getting North Carolina.
The latest tallies gave Biden a solid overall final win in the state-by-state Electoral College that decides the presidency, with 306 votes against Trump’s 232. Two hundred seventy votes are required for election.
President Trump continues to impede Biden’s ability to prepare for his transition ahead of inauguration on January 20 and has filed numerous lawsuits — so far unsuccessfully — to challenge vote counts around the country.
Yesterday, a judge in Michigan issued another rejection of Republican claims of fraud.

Trump said yesterday that “time will tell” if he remains president, in a momentary slip of his unprecedented refusal to concede his election defeat and help Biden prepare to take power.
Trump broke his silence after a week without on-camera comments, speaking at a Rose Garden event to herald the imminent authorisation of a coronavirus vaccine.
During a short speech about the vaccine work, Trump insisted that he would never again call for a lockdown to curb the virus’s spread.

Then he added, “Whatever happens in the future, who knows which administration it will be, I guess time will tell.”
The hint of doubt came despite him continuing to claim that mass fraud — for which no evidence has been produced — robbed him of victory in the November 3 election.
Despite his own intelligence officials’ declaration on Thursday that the election was “the most secure in American history,” Trump and his right-wing media allies show no sign of giving up their quest to get the results overturned.
“President Trump believes he will be President Trump, have a second term,” spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said on Fox News.
Biden is steadily preparing for power, with many world leaders congratulating him on his victory.
China was the latest nation on board, with a foreign ministry spokesman saying, “We express our congratulations.”

Avian influenza has recently spread to western Europe after outbreaks in Russia and Kazakhstan this summer.
“Three wild birds that stayed in a bird sanctuary in Ostend tested positive for the H5N8 virus,” AFSCA said today, adding that the outbreak was confirmed the day before by the Sciensano public health institute.
The risk to humans from the H5N8 subtype is considered to be very low.
AFSCA said the new measures would be effective from Sunday and would apply to private poultry houses as well as individuals who keep birds in their homes, in a country where there is a strong tradition of pigeon racing.
“All gatherings of poultry and birds are strictly prohibited,” the statement said, adding that preventive measures were imposed on professional pigeon farms on November 1.

However, public health officials have warned the government that the rate of infection among over-65s and in nursing homes is concerning.
In a letter from Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan to Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly on 5 November, Holohan said that the incidence of Covid-19 among older people was a cause for concern.
“Notwithstanding the continued overall decrease in case numbers and incidence rates in the general population, outbreaks in nursing homes and the burden of infection among the older age groups (65 years and older) remain a concern,” Holohan said.

724,189,"Taoiseach says British government 'should and must' hold public inquiry into murder of Pat Finucane",https://www.thejournal.ie/pat-finucane-inquiry-5277513-Nov2020/,"THE TAOISEACH HAS said the British government “should and must” hold a public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane.
Micheál Martin has told the Dáil the Finucane family have the “full weight” of the government behind their endeavour to seek justice for Mr Finucane’s killing.
It comes after Mr Finucane’s widow Geraldine and son John met the Taoiseach at Government Buildings in Dublin on yesterday It was the first time the Fianna Fail leader met the family since he became Taoiseach.
North Belfast MP John Finucane said Martin had “committed” to engaging with Prime Minister Boris Johnson in advance of the court deadline of 30 November for the British Government to respond to a Supreme Court ruling made last year.
Pat Finucane, 39, was shot by loyalist paramilitaries in front of his family in 1989 amid claims of collusion with state security forces.
Speaking in the Dáil today, the Taoiseach said the need for a public inquiry was agreed as far back as 2001 and that the UK should stick to that agreement.
“I will be engaging with the British Prime Minister on this issue, and making it very clear the consistent view of successive of Irish governments that are should and must be called public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane,” Martin said.
Yesterday I did sit down with Pat’s wife Geraldine and her son John and I made it very clear to them that they would have full weight of the Taoiseach’s office behind their endeavour. I think for more than 30 years Geraldine Finucane and her family have campaigned tirelessly to get to the truth of what happened in to Pat It’s been a very, very long journey. They have conducted it with great dignity and determination.
In February last year, the UK Supreme Court ruled that investigations into the fatal shooting of the solicitor have not been effective and fell short of international human rights standards.
Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has indicated that a decision over how the government will proceed will be announced.

Martin was responding to Sinn Fein’s Mary Lou McDonald TD, who said the family should not have to suffer any longer and that only a public inquiry could assist them in getting to the truth.
“The Finucane family have spoken truth to power for 30 years. They haven’t been and they will not be silenced. Their questions deserve answers and their questions will not go away,” she said.
“The British Government has an obligation to ensure that the truth is told.”
McDonald told the Dáil she had written to Johnson urging him to “fulfil Britain’s international human rights obligations and hold a public inquiry”.

Speaking after meeting the Taoiseach yesterday, John Finucane MP said the Taoiseach was “completely unambiguous” in his support for their cause.
Finucane said the family were very grateful for his support.
“There’s no doubt in our minds that he understands not just the issues in our case, but the significance that it represents, the importance of having an inquiry, of finally dealing with this campaign, which has been going on too long – we’ve been fighting for an inquiry for 31 years,” he said.
Pat Finucane’s widow Geraldine said: “It means a great deal that the Irish government are continuing to strongly back our call for an inquiry.
He has obviously supported us for a long time, long before he became Taoiseach and I thank him from the bottom of my heart for all he’s about to do. I just hope it pays dividends.
On Sunday, it emerged that four of Northern Ireland’s political parties united to call for a public inquiry into the murder of the solicitor.
The letter,  signed by senior members of Sinn Fein, the SDLP, Alliance and Green Party, emphasises that establishing the full facts around the killing is a matter of “the utmost public interest” and that “only a public inquiry can now assist the Finucane family to get the truth about the scope and extent of state collusion into Pat’s killing”.

US PRESIDENT DONALD Trump has come his closest yet to admitting election defeat after the government agency meant to ease Joe Biden’s transition into the White House said it is finally lifting its unprecedented block on assistance.
Trump yesterday acknowledged it was time for the General Services Administration to “do what needs to be done”.
However, in the same tweet he insisted that he was still refusing to concede, saying: “Our case STRONGLY continues, we will keep up the good fight, and I believe we will prevail!”
Trump today continued to tweet and retweet comments that state he is not conceding. He is also still tweeting about the election being “rigged” without evidence – posts that have been marked as misleading by Twitter.
Biden’s office, which yesterday announced a highly experienced group to be nominated for top US foreign policy and security posts, said the GSA would allow “support necessary to carry out a smooth and peaceful transfer of power”.
“In the days ahead, transition officials will begin meeting with federal officials to discuss the pandemic response, have a full accounting of our national security interests, and gain complete understanding of the Trump administration’s efforts to hollow out government agencies,” Biden’s transition director Yohannes Abraham said in a statement.
The sudden break in Trump’s dogged attempt to deny Biden’s win came after Michigan became the latest state to certify its results and more powerful Trump supporters came out demanding that the impasse end.
Biden to shift diplomacy
Earlier, Biden announced a foreign policy and national security team crammed with veterans from the Barack Obama years, teeing up an end to the upheaval under Trump and a return to traditional US diplomacy.
Top of the list was former State Department number two Antony Blinken, tapped for secretary of state.
Biden also named the first female head of intelligence, the first Latino chief of Homeland Security, the first woman as treasury secretary, and a heavyweight pointman on climate issues – Obama-era top diplomat John Kerry.

The list put out by Biden’s team ahead of a formal announcement today demonstrated a push to bring back the US role of leader in multilateral alliances, in contrast to Trump’s “America first” regime.
“They will rally the world to take on our challenges like no other – challenges that no one nation can face alone,” Biden tweeted. “It’s time to restore American leadership.”
Blinken, a longtime advisor to Biden, will spearhead a fast-paced dismantling of Trump’s go-it-alone policies, including rejoining the Paris climate agreement and the World Health Organization and resurrecting the Obama-crafted Iran nuclear deal.

Biden named the first woman, Avril Haines, as director of national intelligence, and Cuban-born Alejandro Mayorkas to head the Department of Homeland Security, the agency whose policing of tough immigration restrictions under Trump was a frequent source of controversy.
Signaling the Democratic president-elect’s campaign promise to raise the profile of global warming threats, he named Kerry as a new special envoy on climate issues.
And in a further message of US re-engagement with the international community, Biden named career diplomat Linda Thomas-Greenfield for UN ambassador. 
Jake Sullivan, who also advised Biden when he was vice president under Obama, was named national security advisor.
Picked to manage the world’s biggest economy as Treasury secretary was Janet Yellen, who will make history as the first woman in the job if confirmed. The 74-year-old was confirmed as Federal Reserve chairwoman under Obama in 2014 and replaced by Trump four years later.
The picks underline an emphasis on professionals whom Biden already knows well, in contrast to the Trump White House where officials were often picked without having traditional background for the job or proved incompatible and departed in acrimony.
Dwindling options
The president, meanwhile, has largely halted at least his public work duties, while heading out to a golf course he owns in Virginia half a dozen times since the election.
He has also not taken questions from reporters since the election – a previously unimaginable silence from a president who for most of his time in office sparred near daily with the press.
His options for overturning the election, however, are dwindling rapidly in the face of repeated court defeats.

With Biden having won a comfortable victory, Trump’s last card is to disrupt the normally routine process of state-by-state certification of results, followed by the formal 14 December vote by the Electoral College. However, that too is bearing little fruit.
More cracks appeared in the facade of Republican unity yesterday when Senator Rob Portman said it was “time to expeditiously resolve any outstanding questions and move forward”.
Senator Lamar Alexander, a senior Republican and close ally of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said “it seems apparent that Joe Biden will be the president-elect”.
“My hope is that President Trump will take pride in his considerable accomplishments, put the country first and have a prompt and orderly transition to help the new administration succeed,” he said after having issued a similar if less forthright statement a few days earlier.

727,183,"TDs round on Taoiseach for 'charade' and 'abuse of power' over Seamus Woulfe questions",https://www.thejournal.ie/micheal-martin-seamus-woulfe-5277426-Nov2020/,"TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has been accused in the Dáil of setting a “dangerous precedent”, as opposition leaders rounded on him over his response to the Seamus Woulfe controversy. 
The government has insisted that Justice Minister Helen McEntee’s offer to take priority questions on the issue is sufficient, but opposition parties have described such a suggestion as “a charade”. 
Woulfe was nominated to the Supreme Court in mid-July, a number of weeks after the Fianna Fail-Fine Gael-Green Party government was formed. 
McEntee has offered to take priority questions on 1 December on the appointment of Justice Woulfe and the process followed by government. 
Under the proposed format, TDs would have to submit their questions to the minister a week in advance and this has been roundly criticised by the opposition as being too rigid.
Speaking in the Dáil today, Labour leader Alan Kelly said that the Taoiseach should be facilitating accountability among his ministers.  
“You’re creating the most dangerous precedent I have seen in this house in my time here. No minister will be accountable in here if this is what you as the Taoiseach of Ireland allow to happen,” he said.
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the government’s response was “shocking and unacceptable” and that what was “much worse” is the Taoiseach’s stance. 
“Taoiseach, the elected representatives and members here have not only a right but a duty to put the necessary questions to the Minister for Justice, and I for the life of me cannot understand why you are continuing to block that legitimate parliamentary work,” she said. 
“As recently as 2017 you lead the charge for accountability on that occasion and you were right,” McDonald added, referring to Martin’s criticism of the appointment of former Attorney General Máire Whelan to the Court of Appeal three years ago.  
Social Democrats’ co-leader Róisín Shortall described the government’s offer of priority questions as “a charade”:
“It seems like you’re going to be part of the charade being followed by the Minister for Justice in terms of making out that it’s in any way acceptable that she comes in here under the normal oral questions. You know that’s wrong Taoiseach, you know in your heart that’s wrong,” she said. 
In response, Martin said the minister would be coming in to answer “normal questions” on the matter. He also defended his own handling of the controversy: 
My overarching objective in the context of this entire situation and particularly the publication of letters between the Chief Justice and Justice Woulfe has been to uphold the separation of powers between the Oireachtas and judiciary. I take that very seriously. And that has been that has been my motivation from the beginning.

The Justice Minister earlier today was announcing plans for new laws against the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. 
Speaking at a press briefing about that announcement, McEntee said she has attempted to make herself available to the opposition. 
“The suggestion is that priority questions do not hold ministers to account. What I would say is that every week ministers answer priority questions to all party deputies who raise concerns about any issues within that particular department. It has existed for many year, since beginning almost of the Dáil,” she said. 
McEntee also addressed the selection of Woulfe for the vacancy on the Supreme Court.
“I considered this person to be the best person, the Taoiseach, Tánaiste, Minister Ryan and the AG agreed with me and, following that discussion with all four of them, the name was then put to Cabinet and subsequently agreed by Cabinet.”","Justice Minister Helen McEntee also defended the government’s stance.",23,0,0,9457,"1 hour ago"
728,204,"'Were we thinking we had a good chance? Probably not' - Inside Louth's shock move for Harte",https://www.the42.ie/mickey-harte-louth-manager-5277352-Nov2020/,"IN THE DAYS after Tyrone’s Ulster quarter-final exit to Donegal, Mickey Harte first learned of Louth’s interest in bringing him down south as their manager. 
A five-man committee of Louth county board members was set-up to find a successor for Wayne Kierans, and Harte’s name was ambitiously put at the top of the list.
When Tyrone’s interest in the championship ended, the committee had an inkling that the three-time All-Ireland champions would seek a fresh start after 18 years under the legendary figure.
An initial call was made to Harte to gauge his interest. He was open to the idea.
“When Tyrone went out of the championship and we thought there might be an opportunity. It was just more of a conversation,” Louth secretary Bob Doheny tells The42. ”The first official contact was after he stepped down. 
“I’m not so sure was he surprised. Mickey is one of these guys were nothing phases him. The gentleman he is he had no issue speaking with us.”
County chairman and former manager Peter Fitzpatrick told LMFM Radio: “He said he had a few issues he needed to sort out with Tyrone and he’d get back to us by the end of the week.”
Before the pandemic hit, Harte had planned to make 2020 his last as Tyrone boss. Because of how their preparations were disrupted this year, he sought a one-year extension to his term in the wake of the Donegal game.
On Tuesday 11 November, the request was turned down by the Tyrone county management committee. By the end of the week, 10 days ago, the decision to end his long tenure as county boss was announced.
Early the following week, Harte got back in touch with Louth as promised and indicated he’d be willing to discuss the job further. They spoke about the prospect of Harte and Gavin Devlin, his long term assistant in Tyrone, taking charge of the senior and U20 sides on a three-year term.
Harte and Devlin took the weekend to mull over the decision. Though the talks were positive, Louth officers were still unsure as to whether they had their man.
“Were we thinking we had a good chance? Probably not,” admits Doheny.
“But you never know until you make these calls. You could be afraid to make the calls, but you never know until you make them. Mickey being a GAA man, and we’re all GAA people, you have to ask the question.
“We asked the question and as they say the rest is history.”
On Monday Harte confirmed to the committee he was happy to accept the three-year deal offered, with Devlin on board as his assistant manager.
Despite the local talk that Louth were nearing the appointment of their new manager, Harte hadn’t been linked with the role in the media. To keep such a high-profile move under wraps without a leak was unusual in the modern climate. 
“The five of us are working together in the county board and we said from day one that no matter who we speak to, no matter who we speak about, it was all going to be kept under wraps as the names were coming in,” explains Doheny.
“And to be fair to the people we were talking to, we said it’s only fair we kept it [quiet]. So probably coming closer to the time last night it was hard to keep it, but we’d no issue.
“We agreed from the start that we would wait until an agreement was in place on Mickey taking over. Then we said we’d release it through our county PRO.”
It’s 11 months since an almost entirely new county board was put in place, while planning permission was received in September for the construction of a new €12m 14,000-capacity stadium on Dundalk’s Inner Relief Road.
“We came in with an ambition that we were going to be very, very progressive and we had a lot of ambition to get Louth back where we believe is its rightful place. Since 2010 [when they reached the Leinster final under Fitzpatrick] we’ve gone down on a downward spiral.
“We did hit the heights of Division 2,” Doheny says, referencing their rise through the divisions with successive promotions under Colin Kelly in 2016 and 2017.

“But we came in with that ambition and that was our goal. We knew we had a term to get things right and we have. We’re building a new stadium in Dundalk and we made a couple of other appointments.
“Our former county manager Colin Kelly is in as coordinator for our development squads and he’s doing fabulous work there. So we have a lot of ambition and we promised the clubs that we were going to be as ambitious as we can and resulted in us appointing Mickey last night.”
On the field, things haven’t been quite as rosy. Louth will be plying their trade in Division 4 next season while Sam Mulroy was their only scorer when they fell at the first hurdle in Leinster to Longford.
It’s a widely held view that the best players in Louth are not currently togging out for the county team. The appointment of a manager of Harte’s stature is likely to change that immediately, while there is a good deal of excitement locally about next year’s U20 side who’ll also have Harte directing operations.
“We had players from the current senior panel in contact last night and today,” says Doheny.
“They’re over the moon. The good will and good feeling in the county of Louth since last night has been bigger than we expected, it’s huge. The whole county is talking, things have taken off. We’ve a lot of people who are excited and can’t wait now for football to start.”
There have been comparisons made with Paidi Ó Sé’s move to Westmeath in 2003, which took place shortly after his request for a one-year extension in Kerry was turned down.
But there isn’t the same promise in the province as when the Sé arrived. Dublin cast a long shadow over Leinster, having won 15 of the last 16 provincial titles. Harte’s best opportunity of silverware next year will be in the Tailteann Cup or basement division of the league.
It’s unfair to measure success in sport in trophies won, however. Harte said as much following his departure in Tyrone.
“Is success only winning trophies? Well then I wouldn’t be in sport,” he told the Belfast Telegraph.
“Because for me it’s not only about that. There is a desire to win trophies, but the secret to me of sport is to bring players as near as possible to the best of which they are capable. And to me, that’s success.
“Yes, I would dearly have loved to win more All-Irelands and so would the people of Tyrone and I would be loving to be part of the process that would give them that.

He’ll spend the next few days putting together a backroom team and assessing his playing personnel as the 2021 season looms large. It’s anticipated the league will resume around mid to late February, which leaves the Errigal Ciarán man with a short timeframe to get used to his new surroundings.
“I’ve no doubt they’ve done a lot of homework already,” adds Doheny.
“As any manager of his stature and Gavin Devlin as a coach. These guys have a lot of contacts. They know a lot. A lot of our club and county games have been online and are easily accessed. So I would imagine he’s a lot of homework done because he’d have done that before he agreed anything. 
“He’s a GAA man through and through. He lives, eats, breaths, sleeps it. We all do. The passion is there, absolutely. I think it’s massive we give a big word out to Gavin Devlin as well. To get a coach of his stature was massive to come along with Mickey.”

A new statutory instrument signed by Health Minister Stephen Donnelly will see fines coming into effect four weeks after the Bill providing for them became law.
Under the new fixed penalty notices, attending an event in a private dwelling in contravention of regulations can carry a fine of €150.
A person breaching travel regulations can be fined €100, while not wearing a face covering on public transport or in certain retail outlets can carry a fine of €80.
Last month, the prospect of a graduated fines system was first mooted.
The Taoiseach said at the time that the government’s priority was to “work with people to build compliance without having to rely on those measures”.
However, Micheál Martin and the Justice Minister Helen McEntee met with the Garda Commissioner Drew Harris recently to discuss enforcement measures during the pandemic.
In a statement this evening, the Department of Health and Department of Justice said the only enforcement power available previously when people violated regulations under the 1947 Health Act was a ‘Penal Provision’, which carried a maximum penalty of up to €2,500 and/or 6 months in prison, on conviction in court by a judge.
“The Government decided that a more flexible and proportionate system of sanctions was required for offences and breaches of the regulations,” it stated.
The legalisation has five categories of enforcement, as follows:
Non-penal – These are for measures which are included in the regulations as not allowed, but which carry no penalty.
Penal – If a person is prosecuted in court for an offence, the maximum fines or prison sentence decided by the judge, under the new system of tiered penalties, depends on whether it is for a first, second or third or subsequent offence.
Relevant Provision – This allows for licensed premises to be shut for the day, or for longer in the case of further offences.
Fixed penalty provisions – For certain offences, the gardaí has the option of giving a person a fixed payment notice. 
The Fixed penalty notices are listed below:

Advice vs Law: Here's how gardaí are permitted to enforce the new Level 3 restrictions
A person can pay the fixed payment notice within 28 days to avoid prosecution. But non-payment in the specified time means the person can be prosecuted.
A number of months ago, the government flagged that it wanted gardaí to be given powers to interrupt and prevent house parties.
Gardaí were given additional powers to direct people to leave the vicinity of a dwelling if they have a reasonable suspicion that an event in contravention of regulations is going on.
Gardaí can also direct the occupier to ask people leave, and can require the occupier to provide his or her name.
However, they do not have powers to enter a house or home under these provisions but can attend at the main entrance.
A person who does not comply with a direction the gardaí in relation to an event that is in contravention of the regulation could face a summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €1,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one month or both.
The Irish Council for Civil Liberties has raised concerns with a move towards increased enforcement throughout the pandemic.

While the ICCL supports the public health effort and accepts that some restrictions on citizens’ rights are necessary, it has called on the government to use these powers in a manner “that complies with Ireland’s human rights legal obligations”.
“This means all decisions made to restrict our rights must be clearly necessary, as minimal as possible to protect public health and taken in a democratically robust manner – with transparency, consultation, and clear communication with the public,” it states.
The government statement says the new regulations will be in place for the duration of the pandemic. It said he gardaí will continue to use police through engagement, educations,encouragement and ”enforcement as a last resort”.","Not wearing a face covering on public transport or in certain retail outlets can carry a fine of €80.",0,0,0,409,"3 minutes ago"

In a written statement to the Northern Ireland assembly, Minister for Health Robin Swann said there was “clear evidence that the restrictions have proven effective in bringing down the value of R”.

The storm is more than 300 miles south-south-east of Kingston, Jamaica, with maximum sustained winds of 40mph, and moving to the west-south-west at 5mph.
Iota could wreak more havoc in a region where people are still grappling with the aftermath of Eta.

“The Greek government decided the suspension of the functioning of schools until 30 November,” said a statement from Health Minister Vassilis Kikilias. 
“Closing elementary schools was the last thing we wanted to do. This is a measure of how serious the situation is,” he added. 
Secondary schools have already closed and all lessons have taken place remotely since Monday.
Most European countries have kept schools open during the second waves of cases that has hit the continent since September, unlike in March and April when they were shuttered during the first lockdowns.
The World Health Organisation recommends that schools only be shut as a last resort. 
Since late October, the daily number of deaths in Greece has quadrupled with 50 deaths reported some days, while the number of infections has doubled to around 3,000 cases daily. 
Out of the 1,143 total intensive care unit beds nationwide, on Friday, 830 were occupied.
“The coming weeks will be extremely critical”, Greek Prime Minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis said Thursday in the Greek Parliament where he was briefing MPs for the second lockdown since March.

In a letter to the Minister for Health last week, Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan said that the incidence of Covid-19 among older people and in nursing homes, despite a decrease in new cases overall, was concerning.
Holohan said that individual and collective efforts to curb the spread of the virus remained necessary to reduce transmission further and continue to decrease the number of new cases.
“Notwithstanding the continued overall decrease in case numbers and incidence rates in the general population, outbreaks in nursing homes and the burden of infection among the older age groups (65 years and older) remain a concern,” Holohan said.
At the time of the letter on 5 November, a higher proportion of cases notified were from the over-65 age category in the days leading up to Holohan’s update to Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly.
11.9% of cases notified in the previous seven days had been among people over the age of 65, compared to 7.6% of cases notified in the seven day period leading up to 15 October.
However, the 14-day incidence among those aged 65 or older had decreased to 160 per 100,000 on 5 November from 201 per 100,000 on 29 October.
As of 5 November, 56 open clusters of Covid-19 were linked to nursing homes, while 33 were linked to hospitals.
Holohan told the government that current restrictions on movement and social activity have resulted in “reduced mobility” in the population following the implementation of Level Five restrictions.
The average number of close contacts had decreased from around 5 to 6 per confirmed case at the end of September to only 2 to 3.
Holohan said that the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) concluded that the “trends over the last week are broadly positive and should give encouragement that ongoing adherence to the public health measures continues to have a positive impact on case numbers”.

“However, the NPHET reiterated that these latest data should be interpreted with caution and that it is still not possible to draw substantive conclusions about the trajectory of the disease at this point in time,” Holohan said.
“The NPHET reiterated the need for continued individual and collective efforts to further reduce transmission and bring the number of cases and force of infection to very low levels,” he said.
Holohan told Donnelly that NPHET will consider a number of factors in its considerations over the next few weeks.
“In its deliberations over the coming weeks, the NPHET will have regard for the prevailing epidemiological trends, the importance of the Christmas period to society, the lessons learnt from our experience over the past several months, the need for flexibility and best international practice.”","The rate of infection in nursing homes and among over-65s is a concern despite the overall decrease in new cases.",8,0,0,34988,"Nov 14th 2020, 10:38 AM"

Edin Dzeko’s was one of those, our bus driver told us. As a child, playing street football, a friend of Dzeko’s, standing just yards away, was killed by an explosion, his family home destroyed. “I lived with my grandparents in a basement, the whole family – maybe 15 people – crammed into an apartment of 35 square metres,” Dzeko, the former Manchester City forward, said. “I was only young and I cried often. Every day you could hear the guns firing.”
The shooting had long since stopped by the time we boarded the minibus that took us out of Sarajevo and down to Zenica for the Euro 2016 play-off, the night Robbie Brady and Dzeko’s goals led to a 1-1 draw.

All around us was a gentler form of nationalism, Bosnian and Ireland fans mixing happily, drinking heavily and expressing a passion for their country through a love of sport.

You also remember different coloured crosses, greyer memorials from your own youth, the black and white picture of a friend’s father who’d been murdered in the name of Irish freedom. You remember another bus journey, with the same friend and a few others who politicians would have categorised as belonging to ‘the other side’.
It wasn’t just a physical border those guys crossed between Newry and Dundalk but a metaphorical one. A game of rugby, between Ireland and France in the old Five Nations, brought us to Dublin, our friend easily able to distinguish between the violent and the sporting side of Irish nationalism.
Now let’s be clear. The reason we went to Lansdowne Road wasn’t part of some sociological study. Some of us were Catholic, some Protestant, but none of us cared about labels or politics, not when the important issues of drinking, cavorting and figuring out which pubs would accept our fake ID had to be discussed. Rugby was the reason we boarded that bus and travelled that road.
Yesterday evening a different group of people boarded a different kind of bus and made their way to the same address. Lansdowne Road is the Aviva now. November internationals have been rebranded the Autumn Nations Cup. And something else has also changed.

And it is. International competition, in its purest form, was initially created to give us the chance to revel in the deeds of some of our own doing their bit against the best athletes in the planet.
Understandably then when rules change, when dust dirties a once clear concept, when home-born players don’t get the chance to pull the green shirt over their heads, you can see why people get miffed.
But again your mind drifts back, to your friend and his ability to navigate his thoughts through the complex issue of identity and nationalism. If a teenager was able to see two sides of an argument then surely it is not beyond us adults?
Stander has spoken in the past about the criticism he has received on social media, his South African heritage a trigger for the dissent. Roux, too, has been the recipient of online abuse but last night he had his best game yet in an Ireland shirt, he and Lowe the try scorers in Ireland’s 32-9 win.
Neither of them dreamed up this residency rule, and even if they are benefiting from it financially, then so be it. They are much more than tourists. The sight of Lowe holding back the tears last night as he talked about being separated from his family on such ‘a proud and personal night’ made you realise something else. The ultimate compliment a person can pay a nation is choosing to live in it.
These players have made Ireland their home. They aren’t alone, either. Nearly a fifth of this country’s population were born outside Ireland, so words of welcome or hate to a quintet of rugby players will be heard far beyond the tiny pockets of New Zealand and South African communities who live here.
And while we’re not naïve enough to think for a second that sport, especially rugby, is some magical force that can unite the political left and right, we do know it has sent out powerful messages in the past and has the chance to do so again.
As people, Roux, Lowe, Gibson-Park are symbols of what Ireland has become, a more diverse place, open to do business with anyone from anywhere in the world.
So if they’re told often enough the rule is ridiculous and that Paddy from down the road deserves his place more than you, then effectively we’re saying ‘you’re not welcome here, pal’.
We’re editing our own tourist pitch, content to be the land of a hundred thousand welcomes so long as you sign up to the terms and conditions.
Is that what we stand for? You hope not because we’re not just a better team for having Stander, Lowe, Roux, Aki and Gibson-Park. We’re a better place.","Rugby’s residency rule is widely derided but isn’t it time we looked at it from a different perspective?",12,0,0,45084,"Nov 14th 2020, 10:02 AM"

Thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes in four central provinces, according to the disaster management authority, while state media said hundreds of thousands more may have to flee.

Fly-half Nicolas Sanchez scored all the Pumas’ points to hand them their maiden victory over the rugby powerhouse in the 30 Tests they have played.
Mario Ledesma’s side were given virtually no chance ahead of the Tri Nations match in Sydney after a coronavirus-hindered build up of only two low-key practice games.
But in their first Test since the World Cup last year, they pulled off a miracle.
It was a humiliating defeat for New Zealand who were shocked 24-22 by the Wallabies in Brisbane last week and have now lost back-to-back Tests for the first time since 2011 when they crashed to South Africa and Australia.
Coach Ian Foster axed 10 players and named what many regarded as the All Blacks’ best run-on side after last week’s game, but they were no match for a Pumas team helped by former Australian coach Michael Cheika.
Unlike Australia and New Zealand, Argentina did not have a Super Rugby competition to help them prepare. But after months of quarantine, they were chomping at the bit and took their frustrations out on a sloppy All Blacks in a dominant first-half.

New Zealand staged a second-half fightback, but with their eyes on a major upset, Argentina grimly resisted intense pressure to post their best-ever result.
Argentina got the first points on the board in the fifth minute with Sanchez nailing a penalty from the half-way line after some push and shove instigated by New Zealand’s Shannon Frizell.
It didn’t take long for Richie Mo’unga to level the scores but Argentina were playing well, stringing together plenty of phases.

Their pressure culminated in dangerman Sanchez crossing for the first try of the game, getting on the end of his own chip kick to touch down under the posts.

It sent them to the break with a comfortable lead, leaving New Zealand with a major task to save their blushes.
That only got harder when the boot of the irrepressible Sanchez earned Argentina another three points soon after the restart.
With their reputation on the line, New Zealand finally woke up and skipper Sam Cane crashed over for their opening try on 52 minutes after a nicely worked rolling maul from a lineout.

Though health officials and politicians have been cautious in their optimism – the full data hasn’t been published, peer reviewed or assessed by regulators yet – they have said it is a positive indication as we head towards the end of 2020.
Following the announcement from Pfizer/BioNTech about their vaccine candidate, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the Commission will authorise a contract for up to 300 million doses.
She described the vaccine as “the most promising so far” out of all the potential vaccines. 
The Commission has also reached agreements with three other companies that have a vaccine in development:
It agreed with AstraZeneca to purchase 300 million doses with an option to buy 100 million more.
It approved a contract with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV (Johnson & Johnson) to purchase 200 million vaccines with the possibility to purchase a further 200 million.
It signed a contract to purchase up to 300 million doses of the Sanofi-GSK vaccine.
Ireland’s preparations
England’s chief medical officer this week said he was hopeful the first vaccine could be seen by Christmas. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he expects to have 10 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine by the end of the year if it is authorised by regulators and the NHS has reportedly been told to prepare for mass vaccinations in December.
Health officials and political leaders in Ireland have held back on these kinds of ambitious commitments. 
Speaking to RTÉ’s News At One yesterday, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said he believes priority groups will receive a vaccine towards the first half of 2021. He said those who are not considered at high risk will likely have to wait until the middle of the year or later. 
“I don’t have precise knowledge on this yet because a lot depends on the clinical trials, coming through the regulatory authorities in Europe and the FDA in the United States, and then you’re into distribution, logistics, manufacturing as well.
Now some of the companies are manufacturing in advance, and Europe has entered into pre-purchase agreements and we’re part of that.”

Earlier this week HSE CEO Paul Reid said health services across the world will face a number of logistical challenges once vaccines are approved for use.
“Glass vials, which are needed for the manufacturing and distribution will be in high demand across the world,” he said.
“Right now there’s a lot of manufacturing processes that will be in high demand. The transportation between ports to storage locations, there will be a mass demand for vehicles and trucks that can have that storage capacity and they’re not widely available.”
He said there is some capacity in large pharmaceutical companies for the type of storage needed for the Pfizer vaccine and others that would need a very low temperature.
The new taskforce which has been established to oversee the rollout of a vaccine will look at all of these issues, he said. 
The high-level vaccine taskforce will be tasked with co-ordinating preparations and ensuring the nationwide roll out of a Covid-19 vaccine when one is safe and ready to be distributed.
The group will be chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, the former president of DCU. Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan will also be on vaccine taskforce, as will the HSE’s Paul Reid.
Senior civil servant and chair of the senior officials group on Covid-19, Liz Canavan; Barry Lowry, the government chief information officer; and Paul Quinn, the government chief procurement officer, will also sit on the taskforce.
In addition, there will be a nominee yet to be confirmed from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, who will be a logistics cold chain expert and a project management expert.
What we know about these four vaccines
Pfizer/BioNTech
This vaccine uses molecules called ‘messenger RNA’ (mRNA) and is a vaccine approach that has never reached approval before.
Many traditional vaccines involve injecting people with a small amount of the virus. 
With this new approach, the immune system never has to be exposed to the actual virus. Instead, it makes human cells grow what is know as spike proteins, causing the immune system to produce antibodies against the virus. 
The Pfizer/BioNTech Phase 3 study enrolled 43,538 participants, 42% of whom have ‘diverse backgrounds’, according to the companies.
This included participants aged 65 to 85. It said no “serious safety concerns” have been observed. There have been 94 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in trial participants.
Pfizer/BioNTech said the vaccine was found to be more than 90% effective in preventing Covid-19 in participants.
The vaccine, like many of the others currently at Phase 3, require two doses. Clinicians have said this could cause logistical difficulties as it means twice the number of visits to a vaccination centre or wherever it is administered.
At best it could result in resource and administrative challenges in developed countries, but it presents a much more serious barrier for less developed countries.
Another serious roadblock is the temperature at which this vaccine needs to be stored: at -80 degrees. 
For temperatures as cold as the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccination requires, dry ice has to be brought into the mix. Currently, the vaccine is shipped in coolers that can be fed with dry ice to keep it frozen for 15 days. After this it can be refrigerated for up to five days before being diluted and injected.
The medical community is already well familiar with the use of the ‘cold chain’ for vaccinations such as flu. But while laboratories have some experience with the use of dry ice, GPs and pharmacists who play a significant role in the vaccination programme do not have this kind of infrastructure. This is an obstacle – but not an insurmountable one.

This vaccine uses a different process to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. It is what’s known as a a non-replicating viral vector vaccine.
Viral vector varieties use other forms of live virus to deliver DNA into human cells, triggering an immune response. A measles virus modified with a coronavirus protein, for example, could be deployed against Covid-19. 
It only requires one dose, something that is likely to make it one of the most appealing candidates. The vaccine also does not require the intense cold temperatures needed for mRNA vaccines. 
In September, trials on this coronavirus vaccine were paused after a UK volunteer developed an unexplained illness. British regulators and an independent review concluded the illness was not a side effect of the vaccine.
Last month it was confirmed that a volunteer participating in clinical trials of the vaccine developed by Oxford University had died, but the man had received a placebo, rather than the active vaccine. 
The vaccine’s developers have said it produces an immune response in older age groups as well as in younger people. AstraZeneca and Oxford University have said data from their late-stage clinical trials are expected by the end of 2020.
 Janssen Pharmaceutica NV (Johnson & Johnson) 
This is also a non-replicating viral vector vaccine. It uses a dose of a cold-causing adenovirus, modified so that it can no longer replicate. This is combined with a part of the new virus, SARS-CoV-2, called the spike protein that it uses to invade human cells. 
In October, the trial was paused over safety concerns after one patient became sick. The company has since said no clear cause was identified, but based on “information gathered to date and the input of independent experts”, it found no evidence that the vaccine candidate caused the event.
At the end of last month it said it was preparing to resume Phase 3 of its trial, for which it is enrolling up to 60,000 people across 180 sites. The company said this will include “significant representation from those who are over age 60″. 
Pre-clinical testing on rhesus macaque monkeys that were published in the journal Nature showed this vaccine provided complete or near-complete protection against virus infection in the lungs and nose.
Sanofi-GSK
French company Sanofi and British firm GlaxoSmithKline’s vaccine candidate is still undergoing Phase 1 and 2 trials, with the first results expected at the end of this month or in early December. 
The companies have signed an agreement with Covax,  the global inoculation scheme backed by the World Health Organisation, to supply 200 million doses. It has also signed a US deal to supply more than 100 million doses. 
This vaccine uses the same approach as one of its seasonal flu vaccines and is combined with a substance which boosts the vaccine.
Sanofi is also working with US company Translate Bio on an mRNA vaccine but this is at an earlier stage.

Making his mark in England was something he spent a long time working towards, but scoring the winner in a Europa League game against a team managed by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was a surreal experience for a lad who grew up supporting Manchester United.
“It was the first game that my wee one came to as well, her first ever match watching her daddy, so it was nice. Scoring in a game like that was something incredible,” he says, recalling Glenavon’s 2-1 first-leg victory against Molde in the qualifying rounds in 2018.

Daniels’ contribution to the unlikely result stemmed from one of the many performances that enhanced his reputation over the course of a three-season spell with Glenavon.
He was being courted by several other Irish League clubs earlier this year and a transfer to Glentoran was in the offing. While the 24-year-old winger was en route to meet representatives of the Belfast club, a call from Gary Hamilton, his manager at Glenavon, alerted him to an enquiry from across the water.
Signing a two-year contract with Shrewsbury Town has allowed Daniels to launch a career as a full-time professional in England, something he had long aspired to. 
Even as a teenager, when he knocked back the advances of Nottingham Forest in favour of signing for hometown club Derry City – who exposed him to competitive senior football from the age of 17 – it was a decision made with his development in mind. 
Before agreeing to join Shrewsbury, Daniels was a part-time footballer who hadn’t played a game in six months due to Covid-19′s impact on the Irish League. He was therefore restricted to substitute appearances at first, before making the most of his full debut when he was selected in the starting line-up to face Peterborough United a fortnight ago.
Although they were beaten on the day, the game featured a milestone moment for Daniels, who opened his Shrewsbury account with a goal in the defeat to the League One leaders. His objective is to ensure that it’s the first of many for a side that forced Liverpool to an FA Cup fourth-round replay at Anfield back in February.
“I’ve really enjoyed the first few months here,” he says. “The facilities and everything are fantastic. We’ve gone to grounds over here where the lads would be saying the pitch isn’t great, whereas I’m like ‘this pitch is unbelievable, it’s like a carpet!’ Coming from playing part-time in Northern Ireland, I don’t take wee things like that for granted.
“I got used to a professional set-up at Derry City and it was excellent, but over here things are just another level up. It’s a great environment, exactly what I’ve wanted. 
“To be fair to Glenavon, when I signed for the club I told them that my aim was to go full-time with a club across the water. Getting over here has always been my ambition.”
By scoring against Molde and Peterborough United, Daniels created two of his career’s most valued experiences to date. However, regardless of what occurs hereafter, it’s unlikely that any goal will eclipse the significance of his first for Derry City.
“That was a big one for me – very, very special,” he says of his late strike in a north-west derby against Finn Harps in May 2016, a thrilling game at the Brandywell that ended 2-2.
For Daniels, who was aged 20 at the time, it was a moment of joy set against a backdrop of unimaginable tragedy. Seven weeks earlier, he lost several members of his family when their car slid off an algae-covered slipway and entered the water at Buncrana Pier.
Rioghnach-Ann, his four-month-old niece and goddaughter, was rescued by a passerby, but the five other occupants of the vehicle – his mother Ruth (59), sister Jodie-Lee (14), nephews Mark (12) and Evan (8), and their father Sean (46) – couldn’t be saved. 
“What I remember most about the goal is the reaction from both sets of fans. That will stick with me forever,” says Daniels. “I was getting a standing ovation from the Derry fans but also from the Finn Harps fans, which was unbelievable.
“After what had happened, I was back training two weeks later and just made sure I was working as hard as I could to keep my mind focused on football. I’ll never forget that game.”
While absorbing such devastating loss, he was grateful for his club’s unwavering support. Team-mates, coaches, backroom staff and fans rallied around Daniels and his family.
Football became a form of escapism, a semblance of normality during a period of profound mourning, yet he soon realised that a change would be necessary to aid the grieving process, as well as his prospects as a footballer.
As a Derry City player, reminders of the suffering he was enduring were frequent. At every turn he was met by expressions of compassion. They were always appreciated, never taken for granted, but eventually it was time to move on.
Although football could help Daniels to do so, it needed to be detached from the anguish that befell him. Instead of allowing it to be shaped by his connection to such a harrowing event, he resolved to ensure that his life would be defined on his own terms.
“It was important for me to have a clean slate where I’d only be judged on football and nothing else. I’m not a person who craves empathy or sympathy from anybody,” he says.

“You just have to Google my name and what happened is one of the first results that comes up. I understand that it was a massive thing to happen and there was huge public interest. That side of it didn’t matter to me. I was more worried about keeping my sister protected.”
Despite signing for Glenavon in August 2017, Daniels continued to live in Derry, remaining close to his older sibling Louise, who lost her partner and two sons in the Buncrana tragedy.
“Going to Glenavon was the best thing I could have done because it tested my character. It was an hour and 50 minutes away and I was driving there by myself twice a week, going over the Glenshane Mountain on lots of cold, dark nights. All those things sort of built me up mentally.
“I could have joined Coleraine, where I knew a few of the boys and it was only a 40-minute drive. I went to Glenavon because I needed to get away from Derry. I didn’t know anybody there so it was a chance for me to step out of my comfort zone and make a fresh start.
“I knew it was going to test me and it was quite difficult at times, but it was what I needed to do if I was going to get what I wanted, which was to become a full-time professional across the water.
“The set-up at Glenavon was part-time but I never allowed myself to fall into the trap of having a part-time mentality. I always made sure I was doing my extra bits and pieces.
“I’m over in England now at an age where I feel I’ve matured, not just as a footballer but as a person. I might not even have been ready for this move two years ago, so it has all worked out well for me.
“The lads at Shrewsbury weren’t familiar with my background when I came over here. You know the way at a lot of clubs they make you sing as part of your initiation? Here they ask you to talk about yourself and it was one of the things I had to bring up. It was a bit weird explaining it to people who knew nothing about me beforehand.”
When asked if he can allow himself to feel proud of how he prevailed in the wake of an incident that could have left his own plans for the future in tatters, Daniels says: “I don’t think I deserve any credit or anything. I’m just being myself in how I go about things. This is my life and I’m living it the only way I know how to.
“After it happened, my missus would have said to me ‘you can cry, it’s okay to cry and feel sad about it’, but the first time that I really felt overly emotional was when I signed here [for Shrewsbury].
Daniels has 'a brilliant desire and attitude to want to succeed' according to Shrewsbury Town boss Sam Ricketts.

“I was in a hotel on my own for a while when I first came over, so I suppose I had a lot of time to myself and I was a bit overwhelmed, because it’s something I always told my mother I would do. Coming over here just meant so much to me.
“I’ll be 25 next February so I was starting to wonder if my time had passed in terms of getting the opportunity. That was just me being realistic, wondering if the dream was fading.
“But I kept working hard, doing the extra bit, trying to do more than everybody else, and luckily my chance came. I was overcome with emotion in the hotel at that stage but they were tears of just pure happiness.
“What happened is something I try to use in a positive manner as much as I can. I haven’t allowed it to pull me down and I always try to make sure that what I’m doing would make them proud.
“There’s nothing I can do about it now, it’s in the past, but what I can do is keep plugging away to make my own path and create positive things out of something that was a tragedy.
“Thankfully that has been working out for me. It hasn’t been a burden for me, because since it happened all the best things in my life came after it.”
In addition to declaring himself satisfied with where he is at this stage in his football career, the outlook is positive for Daniels away from the pitch too. He has been joined in Shrewsbury by his fiancée Hannah and their two-year-old daughter Zahra.
Before the wedding comes around next May in Enniskillen, he’s eager to play his part in pushing Shrewsbury Town up the table. There are also some long-term personal goals to work towards.
International recognition isn’t currently a realistic prospect, he acknowledges, but having seen one of his best pals use League One as a platform to break into the Republic of Ireland senior squad, Daniels knows what’s possible should he hit the right notes.
His former Derry City team-mate Ronan Curtis, who joined Portsmouth two years ago, earned his fifth Ireland cap in last Thursday night’s game against England at Wembley.

After representing Northern Ireland up to U19 level, Daniels received a call-up from Noel King to a home-based Republic of Ireland U21 squad in February 2017.
“In the short term I need to make sure I’m in the Shrewsbury team regularly and scoring and creating as many goals as I can. Anything that comes from that is a bonus,” he says.
“If I can achieve what Ronan has done I’ll be delighted because it’s every young boy’s ambition to play for their country, but I’m not as close as I need to be just yet.
“I know a lot of players who have gone on to do really well for themselves after coming to League One, so hopefully I can do that as well. Ronan is an international now because he took his opportunity. I’m working hard every day to make sure I grab mine with both hands.”
A desire to turn his favourite hobby into a job is something Joshua Daniels can trace back to the days when he learned the ropes as a teenager at Top of the Hill Celtic in Gobnascale.
With unforeseen challenges to overcome, it may have taken longer than he would have liked, but now he’s finally living his dream.

“A vaccine that sits in a freezer or in a refrigerator or on a shelf and doesn’t get used is doing nothing to help shorten this pandemic,” said Kate O’Brien, director of the World Health Organization’s immunisation department.
US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech announced Monday that their prospective vaccine had proven 90 percent effective in preventing Covid-19 infections in ongoing final phase trials involving more than 40,000 people.
O’Brien hailed the interim results as “extremely important”, and voiced hope that preliminary data from a handful of other candidate vaccines in similarly advanced trials would come through soon.
If the complete data show that “one or more of these vaccines has very, very substantial efficacy, that is really good news for putting another tool in the toolbox” for fighting the pandemic, she said.
But with the pandemic continuing to surge after already claiming some 1.3 million lives, she voiced deep concern at growing signs of vaccine hesitancy, with misinformation and mistrust colouring people’s acceptance of scientific advances.
“We are not going to be successful as a world in controlling the pandemic with the use of vaccines as one of the tools unless people are willing to get vaccinated,” O’Brien said.
More needed to be done to boost public “confidence in the fact that the vaccines that WHO is involved in evaluating, we will not be compromising on safety or efficacy,” she said.
O’Brien acknowledged that there were a number of outstanding questions about the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine candidate and its peers, including how long protection against the virus would last.
And while the vaccine candidates are being tested for how effectively and safely they protect people from developing the disease, it remains unclear whether they actually avert asymptomatic infection and transmission of the virus.

A big question, she said, is: “does it change your likelihood of transmitting to anybody else?”
Despite the remaining questions, the WHO is betting on one or more vaccines winning approval soon, followed by a rapid scale-up of production and distribution.
Anticipating the huge demand for any approved vaccine, the UN health agency has helped create the so-called Covax facility to ensure equitable distribution.
But even with gargantuan efforts, it will take a while before there are enough doses for everyone, and the WHO has set out guidelines for how to prioritise the distribution.
“The goal here is that every country should be able to immunise 20 percent of their population by the end of 2021,” O’Brien said.
That, she said, would go a long way to providing protection to healthcare workers and the most vulnerable populations, as well as those essential to keeping societies running, like teachers.

After that, how quickly everyone else could access a vaccine would largely depend on which country they live in, and whether their government had made deals to access vaccines that obtain approval.
“We would expect many more doses in 2022,” O’Brien said.
Meanwhile, the logistical challenges of getting approved vaccines out to billions who need it are daunting, from manufacturing to ensuring the transportation and storage at the extremely low temperatures some of the candidates require.
“A vaccine that is highly efficacious and is safe… still is only valuable for a public health impact if it actually gets to the people that it needs to protect and is used widely in populations,” O’Brien said.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine “is like establishing base camp at Everest,” she said.
“But actually getting to the impact of vaccines is (like) having to climb Everest.”","A vaccine won’t be able to stop Covid-19 if people are reluctant to take it, a top WHO expert has said.",7,0,0,19703,"Nov 14th 2020, 8:50 AM"

A total of 19,344 domestic abuse incidents were reported to An Garda Síochána between March 2019 and November 2019.
From March to November this year, a total of 22,540 incidents were reported – representing a 14% increase. 
The figures comes after a report from Safe Ireland found that 3,450 women and 589 children contacted a domestic violence service for the first time seeking support and safety from abuse and coercive control during the first six months of Covid-19.
Mary McDermott, co-CEO of Safe Ireland, the national hub for 39 frontline domestic violence services, said: “The study exposes, yet again, patterns of domestic violence heightened by this pandemic.
“It also underscores the enormous strains that services throughout the country were under, and continue to endure, as they deal with the impact of [Level 5].”
While the government said it will prioritise domestic violence, McDermott said this has not been backed up by the resources and infrastructural modernisation that is needed. 
McEntee told Labour leader Alan Kelly this week that, between 1 January and 25 May 2020, Gardaí contacted – or attempted to contact – victims of domestic abuse 8,200 times as part of Operation Faoiseamh. 
McEntee said Phase 2 of the operation, which commenced in May, involves “a focus on targeting perpetrators – and in particular, cases of persistent breaches of protection, safety and barring orders under the Domestic Violence Act.”
McEntee said that €1.9 million funding had already allocated for 2020 in support of victims of crime, including victims of domestic abuse and confirmed that an additional €400,000 had been secured for 2021 to support organisations working with victims of domestic abuse.

746,193,"Thousands rally in Belarus after opposition protester's death",https://www.thejournal.ie/thousands-rally-belarus-opposition-protesters-death-5266542-Nov2020/,"THOUSANDS OF DEMONSTRATORS turned out in the Belarusian capital Minsk yesterday to mourn the death of a protester who was pronounced dead the day after police arrested him.
Lining the capital’s main thoroughfares, the protesters formed human chains, while dozens more laid flowers at the site where Roman Bondarenko, a 31-year-old former soldier, was arrested on Wednesday.
Tens of thousands have taken part in weekly protests since strongman leader Alexander Lukashenko, who has been in power for more than two decades, won in a disputed presidential election in August.
Bondarenko died in Minsk after police arrested him following a dispute in a city square that has become a regular meeting place for the opposition.
Witnesses said unrest erupted between protesters hanging up red-and-white ribbons — the colours of the opposition — and plainclothes police who were removing them.
Bondarenko was pronounced dead on Thursday after suffering brain damage, triggering a wave of outrage among the Belarusian opposition, who believe Lukashenko’s security forces are ultimately responsible.
Lukashenko told reporters Friday that he had contacted investigators and the prosecutor general, telling them to conduct the probe “honestly and objectively”. 
Earlier on Friday, the widow of Alexander Taraikovsky, a 34-year-old protester who died during a rally in August, told AFP that the probe into Taraikovsky’s death had been suspended.
“This was predictable. I was sure that a criminal case would not be opened,” Yelena German said.
Police initially said that Taraikovsky was killed by an explosive device that he was holding, but video footage showed that no explosion took place.
The interior ministry later said it was possible Taraikovsky was shot with a “non-lethal” weapon.
Meanwhile, exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya Thursday called for a minute’s silence to take place at noon on Friday “in every neighbourhood of every city”.
“Let’s do it for the sake of a man who was killed because he wanted to live in a free country,” she said on her Telegram channel.
In another statement, Tikhanovskaya said a “popular tribunal” would be set up to gather “evidence of the regime’s crimes” and officials helping to “capture” Lukashenko would be granted amnesty.  
Tikhanovskaya, 38, believes she was the true winner of the presidential polls and has gained the support of Western leaders who have refused to recognise the election results.
‘Outrageous and shameful’
The European Union has condemned Bondarenko’s death, warning that it could impose further sanctions on targets in Belarus.
“This is an outrageous and shameful result of the actions by the Belarusian authorities,” the EU said.
The EU statement noted that Belarus authorities are guilty of direct violence against the population and of creating an environment in which such “lawless, violent acts can take place.”
Last week, the EU added Lukashenko, his eldest son Viktor and thirteen other officials to a sanctions list for their role in the crackdown.
Huge crowds gathered on Thursday to pay tribute to Bondarenko at what the opposition has dubbed the “Square of Change” after residents resisted attempts by security forces to paint over anti-government murals.

Hundreds also gathered there yesterday in silence, adding flowers and candles to the makeshift memorial to Bondarenko.
Elsewhere around the capital, cars honked as they passed the human chains, while demonstrators made “V” signs for victory symbols with their hands.
Similar demonstrations reportedly took place around the country.
Belarus’s Investigative Committee, a body charged with probing major crimes, said in a statement on Friday that when police arrived at the square on Wednesday a 31-year-old Minsk resident had “bodily injuries and signs of alcoholic intoxication”. 
The statement added that the man was taken to a police station and after his condition worsened to a hospital, where he was confirmed to have alcohol in his system.
A doctor speaking on condition of anonymity to the independent Belarusian news site Tut.by said on Friday that medical staff had found no alcohol in Bondarenko’s system.
“We found nothing at all,” the doctor said.
Police have detained thousands of demonstrators who have reported torture and abuse in custody, prompting international condemnation and Western sanctions.","A former soldier died in Belarus after he was arrested in the capital earlier this week.",4,0,0,17869,"Nov 14th 2020, 7:45 AM"

It only seems like yesterday we were enjoying Summer strawberries and cream and popping an obligatory raspberry into the glass of bubbles. As the seasons change, so does its beautiful bounty.
This time of year really is a favourite of mine when it comes to baking. With the nights drawing in, a chill in the air, there is a natural calling to the kitchen to whip up some seasonal bakes.
For me, this time of year is all about comfort and comfort food. Nothing quite ticks that box like a cinnamon-spiced apple crumble with custard or baked creamed rice pudding with a dollop of blackberry jam.
The season is jam-packed with some of the most delicious sweet treat flavours, including cinnamon, apples, blackberries, figs, clementines and pears and here are three of my favourites bakes.
These are guaranteed to fill your home with the aroma of delicious spices and warm you up on those cold nights.

748,212,"Ireland have 'a few more steps to go to become a champion side' - Sexton",https://www.the42.ie/ireland-johnny-sexton-wales-5266534-Nov2020/,"A WIN AGAINST Wales on a 23-point margin is never something for Ireland to take for granted but Andy Farrell and his players will likely be left with a sense of frustration when they dig through yesterday’s Autumn Nations Cup opener.
There was plenty to like, of course, with the head coach pleased with his players’ “dominant” level of physicality in outmuscling a Welsh team that was truly desperate to win. The scrum gave Ireland some real momentum.
Their defence didn’t leak any tries, albeit they only had to make 88 tackles as they enjoyed a bigger share of the possession and territory. Ireland’s lineout defence was particularly outstanding as Peter O’Mahony and James Ryan made their presence felt.
Farrell had laid down the challenge for players to impress after he made seven changes to his starting XV and there was a response as the likes of O’Mahony, Chris Farrell and Quinn Roux – who started when Iain Henderson was ruled out – took their chances.
Jamison Gibson-Park had several impressive moments on his first Test start, while James Lowe began life as an Ireland player with a very promising performance on the left wing that was capped by a try in the last minute. 
Ireland had some excellent passages of attack as their set-piece plays caused Wales real problems, but very often the positive build-up work ended with Farrell’s side missing an opportunity.
That’s where the chief frustration will lie when they look back at the game, noting how they really should have been out of sight of Wales at half time rather than only 16-6 ahead.
Ireland’s poor start to the second half was similar to their damaging performance in the same period against France two weekends ago in the Six Nations, and that’s likely to be another area they examine in the coming days.
Johnny Sexton and his team-mates will be acutely aware that they need to find another few gears for next weekend’s visit to Twickenham, where they have had bad days against Eddie Jones’ England on their two most recent visits.
Sexton is hopeful of being fit to face the English.

So while Ireland were justifiably pleased to get back to winning ways last night in Dublin, having stewed over their Six Nations defeat in Paris, they won’t be deluding themselves about where they are and what they need to deliver against the English.
“It was a very disappointed camp for the first week [after the France game],” said Ireland captain Sexton last night after the win over Wales.
“We have had to pick ourselves back up from the disappointment of one that we felt got away and one we wish we could go back and play again, but you don’t get second chances in professional sport.
‘I thought we were much better tonight in certain areas but I still think we need to take a step up in terms of accuracy and being clinical. We had a few chances and if Wales had scored straight after half time, it’s an even game, whereas the dominance we had in the first half wasn’t really reflected on the scoreboard.

“There are lots of small things to pick up on but there was much better intent all round and much better attitude in the way we prepared and everything like that. We thought we prepared well for France but, in hindsight, a few guys felt we weren’t right on it.
“You live and learn and thankfully we bounced back well enough. We’ve got a few more steps to go to become a champion side.”
Of course, Sexton himself only lasted 28 minutes of Ireland’s win against Wayne Pivac’s struggling Welsh side, with the out-half forced off at that point due to a hamstring strain he suffered while kicking three points for his team.
It’s obvious that Ireland need Sexton for the visit to Twickenham and he insists he is still hopeful of featuring.
“It doesn’t feel too serious, it’s just very frustrating,” said Sexton post-match. “I initially thought I was going to be able to run it off but unfortunately not.
‘We’ll see tomorrow, I’ll probably get a scan to see if there’s any damage to it or not, but still hopeful for next week.”
Ireland had too much for the Welsh.

Sexton wants to be part of Ireland’s trip to take on the Six Nations champions as they look to learn if they’ve made progress since their last visit earlier this year.
“We got found out a little bit in Twickenham,” said Sexton of the 24-12 defeat back in February.
“England are one of the top sides in the world, top two or three at least. You look at their squad, their third-choice centre is as good as their first. They have got a massive squad and every player is as good as the next.
“So, it’s a massive challenge for us but it’s a great fixture for us to see how far we have come in eight months. It feels like three years.

Here's everything you need to know right now",https://www.thejournal.ie/christmas-travel-advice-ireland-5264465-Nov2020/,"CHRISTMAS TRAVEL: Should Irish people abroad book flights or ferries home? Is it okay to plan a trip abroad from Ireland? 
These are just some of the questions being asked in households here and in far-flung parts of the world this week. 
The issue of travel has dominated the headlines after Tánaiste Leo Varadkar told the Dáil this week that he wouldn’t advise that people overseas to book flights home just yet.
His words to the Dáil on Thursday provoked a mixed response. Joe Duffy’s Liveline switchboard lit up with calls, with one listener telling the host they were “disgusted” with Varadkar’s comments.
Since the start of the pandemic, the government has come in for criticism over its perceived mixed-messaging on international travel.
It was hoped by those in the corridors of power that this would be put to bed this month as Ireland aligned with the rest of Europe in adopting the new ‘traffic light’ travel system.
Related: New traffic light travel system kicks in – here’s what you need to know >
But heading into December, the public has a number of layers of travel advice to get its head around. Far from ideal. 
So, what’s the overall picture? 
Well first of all, there is what you legally can and can’t do. 
Legally, there is no law stopping someone from either flying into Ireland or someone flying out of Ireland. Flights are going every day, travel never stopped in Ireland, and it was never banned.
If you decide to fly in or out of Ireland, you won’t be stopped at the airport or sent back home.
Mandatory quarantine is not in force in Ireland. Nor is it a legal requirement for a person to restrict their movements for 14 days after their arrival from another country, but as one of the key measures for stopping the spread of Covid-19 it is very strongly advised
What is legally mandated is the requirement to fill in a Personal Locator Form at the airport or port when you arrive in Ireland. Details of your address and other contact details should be logged on that form, in order to aid contact-tracing in the event that it’s required. 
Moving on from what’s legally allowed or not, we come to the government’s official public health advice under Level 5 restrictions.
With the current restrictions in effect until the end of the month the advice remains that there should be no non-essential international travel.
In addition, all residents of Ireland are being asked to restrict movements to within 5km of their home unless it is strictly essential. Any arriving passengers in Ireland are asked to abide by these public health measures.
Official government policy on international travel is provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs.
Anyone looking to travel into Ireland or abroad, would generally be guided by this advice, which is available on the DFA website.
The department states that if you are considering travelling, it continues to advise against non-essential travel overseas - other than to countries that are part of the EU ‘traffic lights’ approach.
The advice for people travelling to these areas is to exercise a high degree of caution. 
However, many of the countries that have signed up to this system currently have their own quarantine or other requirements for arriving passengers – some of which are much harsher than ours. 
For instance, Irish people arriving in France can only enter “as long as they can present proof that they are travelling for a professional, medical, or urgent family purpose, or are returning to their primary residence in France”.
More on the traffic light system later. 
What’s the plan for Christmas? 
In short, officially, there isn’t one yet. 
What Leo Varadkar told the Dáil on Thursday was that that Irish people living abroad shouldn’t book flights home for Christmas just yet.
The reasoning behind this is somewhat obvious. While we have our second wave largely under control, it is still raging in other countries, meaning that a large influx of people travelling to Ireland and dispersing around the country brings with it a massive risk of transmission.
Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan went a step further than Varadkar, saying that flying home for Christmas was not essential.
“We think people should avoid non-essential travel and continue to do so for the foreseeable future,” Dr Holohan said at NPHET’s Thursday night press briefing. 
“That includes the Christmas period, and we would feel that the kind of travel that would normally happen at Christmas time, people coming back to spend time with their loved ones, [...] we have to regard as non-essential for this Christmas.”
As of yet, we don’t know what public health advice will be in place once Level 5 expires at the end of this month. Although, obviously, there will have to be some level of restrictions. 
Taoiseach Micheál Martin acknowledged this yesterday when he told RTÉ’s News at One that the government would give people notice “before the end of November” of what the plans for the Christmas period will be “so that people can make preparations”.
He agreed with Varadkar that “at this moment people should wait” before booking flights home to Ireland for Christmas, but added that clarity on that issue and other arrangements for Christmas would be given before Level 5 ends.
The Taoiseach said the government would listen to NPHET advice, but that what happens in terms of travel around Christmas will be a government decision 
It’s envisaged that enhanced testing regimes will form part of any international travel advice. 
Tell me more about the testing so
From midnight on 29 November, travellers arriving into Ireland from so-called ‘red’ regions in the new traffic light system will be advised that they no longer need to restrict their movements once they pass a Covid-19 PCR test (usually a nasal swab) five days following their arrival here.
As of last Sunday night, travellers arriving from orange regions do not have to restrict their movements if they carry the results of a negative Covid-19 test taken at least three days before their arrival.
Those who do not have a negative test upon arrival in Ireland can have a test taken five days after their arrival. 
Passengers will be asked to restrict their movements until they get the test.
Currently, a person is advised to restrict their movements for 14 days following arrival from a ‘red’ region.
A Covid-19 test centre is due to be up and running at Dublin Airport next week, while new testing facilities became fully operational in Cork and Shannon Airports this week. 
PCR tests from private operators cost between €130 and €199 in most cases in Ireland – away from airports, other private companies are already offering them.
Some airports in other countries offer free PCR testing. As demand increases, it is envisaged that the cost here will come down. If other rapid tests are approved as alternatives to PCR, they will be a lot cheaper.

Children under 6 are to be exempt from testing requirements.
And what’s the story with the traffic light system again?  
As stated above, Ireland is now a part of this. 
Under the new EU traffic light plan, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control publishes a weekly map of the EU using a three-stage colour system to indicate the level of risk in each area.
Levels are determined by a variety of epidemiological factors including the 14-day incidence per 100,000 population and the level of positive tests.
Ireland signed up to the plan in October, and it became fully operational this month.
Currently, as the second wave rages on the continent, pretty much everywhere is ‘red’. There’s a smattering of orange areas and absolutely no green. 
Hold on. Whatever happened the Green List?
See why this is confusing? 
Don’t be minding the Green List. 
It’s no longer a thing.
Forget it ever existed. 
What about countries like the US, what rules apply to travelling from there? 
The US and other areas are classified as ‘grey’ in the new traffic light system.
Grey areas are classified the same as ‘red’ countries or regions, and therefore, if you are arriving from a red region or grey regions, like the United States, from 29 November you will be advised that you can move freely once you pass a PCR test five days after arrival.
Currently people should restrict their movements for 14 days following arrival.

So are we allowed to fly?
Once again, yes. Airports are open, and flights are taking off. There is nothing stopping a passenger from flying.
Can people book Christmas flights home to Ireland?
Airlines and routes are operational and open to taking bookings. 
Can I book a holiday outside Ireland?
The new EU travel plan it does not specify reasons for travel.
The Department of Foreign Affairs says should you decide that you need to travel, you should inform yourself about any requirements in your destination.
Information about entry restrictions currently applied by other countries is available on the DFA’s the country-specific travel advice pages. 
Additional restrictions may be imposed in your destination, including during the duration of your visit. 
Again, the public health advice in place at the moment advises against non-essential travel – domestically and internationally. 
What groups of people do not have to adhere to movement restrictions?
Under the traffic light system, a certain number of travellers are exempt from the requirement to undergo quarantine measures or movement restrictions.
These include  passengers travelling for imperative family reasons and those travelling for business reasons. You can see the full list here.

Health Minister Roberto Speranza was expected tonight to sign a new ordinance designating Campania, the region around Naples, as a virus “red zone”, with the extra health rules that brings.
Meanwhile, the mayor of Naples, Luigi de Magistris, called for economic relief for his city, where protests erupted last month after initial, more modest restrictions.
Outside the Cotugno hospital in Naples, medics brought out oxygen tanks to treat people parked in their cars outside the crowded emergency room, while others in full protective gear awaited ambulances bringing in new Covid patients.
“We have almost no more beds available,” Rodolfo Punzi, head of the hospital’s infectious disease department, told AFP.
“Unfortunately, the disease requires long hospitalisations and that’s why there is a low turnover. The emergency room… gets full of people who need to be hospitalised but also of people who could be assisted locally in their homes.”
He said he was “proud” to see nurses running outside “to take care of patients with oxygen tanks”.
‘We’re afraid’
But such scenes have sparked fear among many in Campania, which was spared the worst of the coronavirus outbreak that ravaged northern Italy earlier this year.
A video showing a dead man on the bathroom floor of the emergency room in Naples’ Cardarelli hospital went viral this week, despite uncertainty over how exactly he died.
“That video unmasked the many lies that are told and repeated about healthcare in Campania. We are afraid. We are asking for help,” said Don Maurizio Patriciello, a priest and long-standing health campaigner in the region.
“We are told not to clog up hospitals, to stay at home when the first symptoms of contagion appear. We obeyed, we got sick, we phoned for the swab (virus test), but it was hours, days, before we had the slightest response.”
Italy imposed a national lockdown earlier this year that brought the outbreak under control, but has been seeking an alternative approach to the recent surge in cases – with little apparent success so far.
Infections passed the one-million mark this week while cases rose by over 40,000 today. In recent days the daily death toll has topped 600 to reach more than 43,000 since the crisis began – and the burden threatens to overwhelm health services.
Towards red zone?
Campania is particularly at risk. In a 2018 study published earlier this year, it came second only to Calabria in having Italy’s worst quality of care.

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte’s government has mooted sending in the army to help, including to set up field hospitals, while it is also encouraging the use of hotel rooms for recuperating patients.
Last week it introduced a nationwide night curfew and a system of regional restrictions with the toughest measures in areas of highest risk.
Campania was originally assessed as only “yellow” medium risk, but the data was later questioned and the government sent in its own inspectors on Thursday.
In Italy’s red-zone regions, mostly centered in the north, bars, restaurants and most shops are shut, and residents’ movements restricted.
The health ministry’s coronavirus consultant, Walter Ricciardi, said yesterday he would have made Naples a red zone three weeks ago, warning of “war scenes” in hospitals.
Many health experts say tougher restrictions across the whole of Italy are now urgently needed.
“We call for an immediate lockdown of the whole country,” said Filippo Anelli, head of the national surgeons’ federation.

Leonard Moses had been jailed for life for throwing Molotov cocktails together with a group of others during riots that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr in 1968. The petrol bombs set fire to the Pittsburgh house of Mary Amplo, who was severely burned and later died as a result of her injuries.
In 1971, Moses was granted a furlough to attend the funeral of his grandmother and used the occasion to give police the slip, changing his name to Paul Dickson and working, at least since 1999, as a traveling pharmacist in the state of Michigan, police said. 
The FBI renewed their search in 2016, questioning his family once again and offering a reward for his arrest, as well as setting up a dedicated tip hotline.
Despite more than 2,000 tip-offs, the FBI were “still unable to locate and apprehend Leonard Moses,” said FBI agent Michael Christman, an FBI official at a press conference in Pittsburgh.
But at the beginning of this year, he was detained and questioned in the course of a separate investigation, whose nature the FBI did not disclose.
Legal records show that a Paul Dickson, born in 1949, was arrested in the state in April for fraud and writing illegal prescriptions for controlled substances.
In the course of the investigation, the suspect’s fingerprints were taken and fed into a law enforcement database, eventually proving a match for the federal records the FBI held on Moses.

While the Red Hand are yet to officially confirm the news, his exit is being widely reported tonight — the Irish News first with the story, with RTÉ following suit.
Having taken over ahead of the 2003 season, Harte was the longest-serving manager in inter-county football before he stood down. During his 18 years at the helm, he delivered three All-Ireland crowns, six Ulster championship titles and one National League honour to the county.
The county also enjoyed plenty of success at minor and U21 level under the Errigal Ciarán clubman’s watch.
Speculation on Harte’s future grew this week after reports from the Ulster Herald and the BBC noted that he had a request for a one-year extension to his stay rejected by the county board.
“I respect the outcome of these meetings and that’s it’s time to reflect on what happened and leave the present to unfold itself,” Harte told The Irish Examiner tonight.

The US President also went on the attack against New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, suggesting that the vaccine would be made available to all Americans except for those in New York state.
He said this would be for “political reasons”, and suggested Cuomo had made a series of errors in his handling of the coronavirus. He said it “pained” him that New Yorkers wouldn’t get the vaccine. 
The briefing centred on Operation Warp Speed – the Trump administration’s efforts to produce and distribute a vaccine – and came in the wake of Democrat Joe Biden solidifying his election win with a final tally of 306 votes in the state-by-state Electoral College that decides the presidency, against 232 for Trump.
The result came after several US networks called traditionally Republican-leaning Georgia in Biden’s favor, while Trump took North Carolina.
Trump won by the same margin in 2016 against Hillary Clinton, and has repeatedly referred to his own 306-vote victory as a “landslide”.

He had not had a press conference since last week’s election and the last time he addressed the nation was 5 November, when he falsely claimed to have won.
Trump has spent the last 10 days consumed by his pursuit of a conspiracy theory that Biden was declared winner only through massive ballot rigging.

US election officials say there is 'no evidence' of compromised votes
Despite his own intelligence officials’ declaration yesterday that the election was “the most secure in American history,” Trump and his right-wing media allies show no sign of giving up their crusade.
Today, Trump tweeted thanks to supporters backing his claim that the “Election was Rigged” and said he might “stop by and say hello” at a rally planned in Washington on Saturday.
In reality
Biden, meanwhile, is steadily preparing to take over on January 20 and the list of world leaders accepting that he will be the new president keeps lengthening.
China was the latest nation on board, with a foreign ministry spokesman saying “we express our congratulations.”
However, Biden’s newly appointed chief of staff, Ron Klain, told MSNBC late Thursday that moves by Trump to block the incoming administration from access to confidential government briefings posed a growing risk.

Wales 9
ANDY FARRELL’S IRELAND got off to a winning start in the Autumn Nations Cup but it may have come at a cost as captain Johnny Sexton and his replacement at out-half, the debutant Billy Burns, were both forced off injured.
A first-half try from the superb Quinn Roux proved important in Ireland’s victory while James Lowe powered over for a last-minute score on debut in a game that saw Conor Murray playing the closing 15 minutes at out-half.

The Munster scrum-half slotted two penalties and a conversion for Ireland in that time on an evening that had started with Ireland ruling out lock Iain Henderson and fullback Jacob Stockdale before kick-off.
That allowed Roux to come into the starting XV, along with Andrew Conway, and the Connacht man delivered an excellent performance as he and tighthead prop Andrew Porter did plenty of damage to the Welsh scrum.

James Lowe had some very strong moments on his Test debut on the left wing, suggesting that he is capable of thriving at this level, while Jamison Gibson-Park looked very sharp on his first Ireland start at scrum-half.
Number eight Caelan Doris was man of the match with a physically dominant performance in his natural position – assisting Lowe’s score – and Farrell will have some interesting selection calls to ponder ahead of next weekend’s visit to England. 
Skipper Sexton departed with a hamstring injury in the 28th minute – with James Ryan taking over as captain for the first time – and Farrell will be hoping that issue clears in time to allow the 35-year-old to start in Twickenham. Burns is another concern after being forced off with a head injury in the second half.
It was a largely frustrating second 40 minutes in Dublin after a promising first half had seen Ireland into a 16-6 lead that they will likely feel should have been more, with several impressive attacking passages failing to yield points.
The dominant Irish scrum was a pleasing sight for the Irish coaching staff ahead of a massive test in that department in Twickenham next weekend but the sense is that Ireland will need to find another few gears across the board if they are to compete with the English.
Keeping the Welsh tryless was another real positive for Ireland, but the reality is that Wyne Pivac’s side were poor again as they recorded their sixth consecutive defeat. This is a worrying time for a team that has rapidly regressed since Warren Gatland’s departure.
There was real niggle to the contest in Dublin.
Source: Dan Sheridan/INPHO
There was niggle from very early in the game as the excellent Peter O’Mahony and Alun Wyn Jones came face-to-face in one exchange, but the Welsh would have been disappointed not to convert two lineout platform in the Ireland 22 in the opening five minutes into points.
Instead, Ireland showed the greater attacking incision, a clever lineout play freeing Sexton to break only for Lowe to drop his pass on the left touchline with the opportunity clear.
Ireland’s scrum dominance began from the ensuing scrum with a first penalty and they won a second just after hooker Ronan Kelleher’s crooked throw into a lineout on the Wales five-metre line. Sexton opted to take the points.
Ireland appeared to be en route to the opening try in the 14th minute as meaty carries from Roux, Doris, and Porter, as well as another Sexton dart, left them just metres out, but Justin Tipuric swooped for a turnover penalty after Ryan had carried.
The Welsh soon equalised as Robbie Henshaw was pinged for not releasing following a tackle on Jonathan Davies, with Biggar popping over the three points.
But Ireland’s set-piece attack created another opportunity as a clever inside pass from Gibson-Park off the edge of a maul found Lowe coming from an initial position at the front of the lineout. He showed his power to break and then offloaded inside to Sexton, who was hauled down. 
Quinn Roux scored for Ireland in the opening half.

As they scrambled to recover, Wales gave up a penalty and Ireland opted for the five-metre scrum. They went direct with their attack as Doris’ strong carry left them close and then Roux picked and battered his way over, Sexton converting for 10-3.
The Ireland out-half added another three points just after his clever grubber kick saw the retreating Davies spill the ball and Henshaw pounced for a turnover penalty when Halfpenny dived on the scraps. 
Sexton hurt his hamstring in the process of kicking, however, and Ulster’s Burns was sent on for his debut with just 28 minutes gone.

A scrum decision went against Ireland a few minutes later, despite them moving forward, and Halfpenny reduced the deficit from the tee. But that was a very brief respite as Ireland soon turned over a Welsh scrum against the head and surged into their 22 to win another penalty that Burns slotted.
With the lion’s share of possession and territory, Ireland would have been frustrated not to add another score before the break but Conway was tackled into touch on a shortside attack from a maul and then a TMO review ruled out a possible Irish try after lineout pressure from Ryan had seen Will Rowlands bat the ball down into his own in-goal area.
Referee Mathieu Raynal ruled that Porter had knocked-on in the scramble and Ireland led 16-6 at half-time.

Halfpenny had a shot at goal from halfway six minutes into the second half as Ireland restarted rather sloppily to allow the visitors some much-needed momentum. The Welsh fullback was on target in the 50th minute to draw his side back to 16-9 after Hugo Keenan was turnover over when Ireland attempted to attack out of their own 22.
It was Doris who got Ireland back into the game, blocking down Gareth Davies’ attempted box-kick exit and then showing real intelligence to flick the ball back infield just before it hit the touchline, allowing Cian Healy to gather and dive for the tryline, Wales just about managing to hold him up.
Ireland couldn’t convert from the five-metre scrum, though, as the Welsh repelled their direct attack and Healy was turned over.
But a clever sniping break from Gibson-Park after the Welsh exit kick saw Raynal award another penalty, with Burns kicking the three points for 19-9.
James Ryan’s high tackle on Josh Adams on the Ireland 22 meant Halfpenny had another chance off the tee soon after but he surprisingly missed as the contest entered its final quarter.

An injury to replacement Burns saw Murray entering the fray at out-half in the 65th minute and he was quickly pressed into action as he also took over from the tee, making no mistake by slotting a penalty just after coming on.
Murray added another penalty and though the game really didn’t ignite thereafter, the Munster man did a fine job as the makeshift out-half.
Raynal’s decision-making didn’t help the flow of the game in the closing 10 minutes but Ireland did finish strongly as Doris picked and arced off a five-metre scrum before popping to Lowe on a short, hard line off his right shoulder.
The Leinster man barreled over for his first Test try and Murray converted with the final act of the game.

Tesla’s Elon Musk reflects on how strange his 2020 was. 
(Vanity Fair, approx 15 mins reading time)
But this year, Musk set off on the most difficult mission of all. An expedition that has nothing to do with space, or fossil fuels, or coronavirus, or saving the lives of 7.7 billion people. And yet this new mission—unlike the long list of other tasks he plans to accomplish in his lifetime—is one that he may not be able to see through. A mission that, perhaps, no one of his stature has ever been able to accomplish. One that plagued Steve Jobs before he died. One that still afflicts Jack Dorsey each day. A mission that has sickened men and women since the dawn of modern civilization, kings, queens, business leaders, and politicians alike. A mission that may prove to be the most difficult one of his entire life: Elon Musk is on a mission to stop giving a shit what people think of him.

THE FINAL ELECTORAL college tally of the US election is in: with 306 electoral college votes projected for Democrat Joe Biden, and 232 for Republican Donald Trump.
This is an exact flip of the final vote in 2016 – when Trump won 306 electoral votes, and the Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton won 232. 
Popular vote-wise, Biden won 77.5 million votes (50.8%) compared to the 72.3 million (47.4%) who voted for Trump, a 5 million vote advantage
US President-elect Biden won the states of Arizona and Georgia today, the New York Times, CNN, ABC and other networks said, while Trump won North Carolina.
Biden’s win in Arizona represents a ‘flipping’ of the state to Democrat for the first time since 1996, when Bill Clinton won the state’s support for his White House bid.
The tight race in Arizona ended with a lead of more than 11,000 ballots for Biden, giving him the state’s 11 electoral votes.

The worrying trends forced Illinois Governor JB Pritzker to warn he may have to issue stay-at-home orders for Chicago and the rest of the state if people continued to gather in public.
“With every fibre of my being I do not want us to get there,” said Pritzker. “But right now that seems like where we are heading.”
Chicago has issued a non-mandatory stay-at-home advisory because its hospitals serving the poorest communities are filling to breaking point.
Hospitals are also treating more patients in France than they during the first peak while Italy has seen the virus race down into its less developed south — largely spared when the virus came crashing down from China at the start of the year.
“We have almost no more beds available,” Naples hospital doctor Rodolfo Punzi said.

‘Covid fatigue’
The latest wave of restrictions come with policymakers worried about how they can persuade people who had only returned to some sort of normal life a few months ago to lose certain freedoms once again.
“Covid fatigue is definitely setting in,” Newark mayor Ras Baraka said after imposing a nighttime curfew on his city on the edge of New York.
An Ifop survey in France showed 60% of respondents admitting to flouting rules at least once by making up a false excuse to go out or meeting up with family and friends.
Governments are also worried about how long curbs can last without devastating economies that had only just begun to stir back to life.
Capital Economics noted that French President Emmanuel Macron had promised last month to lift restrictions once new daily infection numbers fall from the current 30,000-40,000 to just 5,000.
“On that basis, if cases fall by the same rate now, France’s lockdown could last for over two months,” the consultancy said in a research note.

And US government scientist Anthony Fauci issued a tantalising hint that another vaccine is “literally on the threshold of being announced”.
US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech announced this week that their vaccine had proven 92% effective in preventing Covid-19 infections in Phase 3 trials involving more than 40,000 people.
“The cavalry is coming, but don’t put your weapons down,” Fauci told a conference by video link.
Most believe he was referring to Moderna – a US biotech firm focused on the same mRNA research as Pfizer and BioNTech.
World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was encouraged by the rapid progress toward a vaccine.
But he added: “We must apply the same urgency and innovation to ensuring that all countries benefit from this scientific achievement.”
Italy’s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte tried to lighten the mood by promising that Christmas will not be cancelled even if Europe’s borders are shut.
“Father Christmas assured me that he already has an international travel certificate,” Conte wrote on Facebook.

In a statement, it said that a further seven people confirmed to have Covid-19 have died.
The death toll from the coronavirus in Ireland is now 1,972, and the total number of confirmed cases is now at 67,099.
As of 2pm today, 258 Covid-19 patients are hospitalised, of which 35 are in ICU with 12 additional hospitalisations in the past 24 hours.
From today’s numbers, 128 are in Dublin, 45 in Cork, 43 in Waterford, 24 in Donegal, 24 in Meath, 36 in Limerick and the remaining 182 cases are spread across 20 other counties.
The current 14-day incidence rate of Covid-19 is 129.2 per 100k.
Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said: “The increase in case numbers of Covid-19 today is an important reminder of the unpredictable nature of this highly infectious disease. The hard work undertaken by all of us over the last three weeks is to be commended, but we must not allow our success to date let us drop our guard against the spread of this disease.
“We need to hold firm to the public health advice: keep 2m distance, wash our hands, wear face coverings where appropriate and limit ourselves to essential contacts from our own household. If we can keep up high levels of compliance, we can get to where we need to be on the 1 December.”
Earlier today, Taoiseach Micheál Martin appealed to the nation to adhere to Level 5 restrictions for the next three weeks. 
Marking the mid-point of Level 5 restrictions, Martin said the data suggests that the efforts in place are working.

BORIS JOHNSON’S SENIOR adviser Dominic Cummings has let it be known he is leaving Downing Street.
The Prime Minister’s controversial aide left Westminster this evening ominously carrying a heavy box, as if he’d just cleaned out his desk.
Political correspondents in Britain have said there was a parting of the ways between Cummings and Johnson today, and it now appears he’s gone sooner than expected.
Here, we take a look at why he is going.
What happened?
Cummings says he always intended to depart at the end of the year but all the signs are he is leaving after losing out in a power struggle among the Prime Minister’s inner circle.
He wanted his close ally Lee Cain – the No 10 director of communications – to be installed as Johnson’s chief of staff, thereby strengthening his own grip on the Downing Street operation.
But the proposed move infuriated many senior Tories – and, it is said, the Prime Minister’s fiancee Carrie Symonds – who were alarmed at the prospect of Cummings extending his influence even further.
When it failed to work out, Cain – who feared he was being sidelined with the appointment of a new press secretary – announced he was quitting.
What did Cummings do?
Cummings says reports he threatened to resign on the spot are an “invention” but he was clearly very unhappy at what happened.
Within a little over 24 hours he was telling the BBC he would be going, too. And, this evening, it appears he has in fact left Downing Street for good.
Why are people making such a fuss over an adviser leaving?
Cummings was regarded as being more powerful than most ministers, exerting control over the government’s agenda and demanding iron discipline from the army of Whitehall special advisers.

As Vote Leave campaign director he is regarded as the mastermind behind the 2016 Brexit referendum vote and is credited with playing a key role in last year’s general election victory.
But his abrasive manner and open contempt for MPs and officials earned him many enemies in Westminster, who will not be sorry to see him go. Furthermore, his flouting of Covid restrictions in the early stages of the pandemic didn’t endear him to many. 
What effect will his departure have?
It is not clear – although some at Westminster are predicting it will lead to a less confrontational style of government with a greater focus on issues such as climate change and building bridges with the devolved administrations.
Unhappy Tory MPs, who have felt ignored by No 10 since the election, will hope Downing Street will begin including them.
Others expect there will be less inclination on the part of the Government to pick fights across a range of institutions – from the BBC and the media to the judiciary.
Whether it works out that way remains to be seen.","A power struggle in Downing Street means that Boris Johnson’s top advisor is now set to leave his job.",6,0,2,49168,"Nov 13th 2020, 5:09 PM"

768,180,"No consensus among party leaders after meeting on Seamus Woulfe controversy",https://www.thejournal.ie/seamus-woulfe-3-5264072-Nov2020/,"Updated Nov 13th 2020, 5:00 PM
NO CONSENSUS ON the approach to be taken to the Seamus Woulfe controversy has been reached between party leaders after meeting with the Taoiseach this afternoon.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the meeting was being called “to get a sense” of how other parties view the situation.
Following the meeting, Opposition leaders have said no consensus on how to break the impasse has been reached.
There were divided views between party leaders as to how to proceed. 
Speaking to TheJournal.ie, Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy said the Opposition leaders did not get sight of the Attorney General’s advice to government today, stating that she would now be writing to the Ceann Comhairle seeking for separate legal advice on the matter to be sought on behalf of the Oireachtas.
She said the meeting was very “frank” this afternoon. 
Murphy said party leaders have to consider the “long-term consequences” of proceeding, and will also have to “make a judgement call” on the legal advice when it is received.
“We all want this dealt with quickly,” she said, but indicated it could be a longer process than some might like if the call is made to proceed. 
“There are quite a lot of things to be sorted before we get any clarity,” she said, highlighting that if it is decided that impeachment proceedings get the go ahead – which she said no one has said will happen – it will involve a committee being set up, members being appointed, and terms of reference being drawn up. 
Any decision may well be appealed and it could end up in the Supreme Court, she highlighted, stating that it is “very circular” how things could play out.
“There is no easy solution with this,” she said.
Speaking after the meeting, Labour leader Alan Kelly also described the meeting as “very open” and “frank” .
He said it was too early to say whether impeachment proceedings are under consideration.
“We are very clear that this issue needs to be dealt with quickly,” he said.
Kelly said he wants all correspondence between the Chief Justice Frank Clarke and Woulfe to be published. 
In publishing his letter, Clarke sent the issue “across the river to Leinster House”, said Kelly. 
In a letter Clarke sent to Woulfe, which he published, the Chief Justice said he believed Woulfe should resign his position in the wake of the controversy caused by the Golfgate dinner.
He said politicians now find themselves in an “unprecedented situation”.
Speaking earlier today, the Taoiseach said the situation was “very serious” and “grave”.
“The separation of powers is something I hold very dearly. It’s a crucial part of our democracy. And so, there’s a reluctance for the political system to embroil itself in the judicial arm of government.
“Nonetheless, this issue falls to consideration. In the first instance for the political system. I am thankful, and I appreciate the fact that political leaders across the Dáil have been very restrained,” he said. 
The Taoiseach said he too had to careful in his comments in case a motion of impeachment does come into play and he has to play a role in that process.
On the matter of impeachment, Martin said that is “not even contemplating that right now”.
“I mean it’s not, whether that will happen or not will be a matter of for the Oireachtas  ultimately to decide.
“I think the initial situation here is my role in government is to ensure continued confidence, both in our legislative system and our judiciary arm. And that’s the objective I have going into these talks with the opposition leaders. And so I’m not pre-empting what may emerge ultimately out of this. Suffice to say that I’m determined that we retain the integrity of our system, and that we do everything we possibly can to protect the Supreme Court itself,” he said.
Speaking ahead of today’s meeting, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said that it was “manifestly the case” that Woulfe’s position as a Supreme Court judge was not tenable. 
“The publicly known facts are that the Chief Justice has suggested by letter, which is now a matter of public record, that Justice Woulfe should resign. And I think that creates clearly a problem, and clearly an issue around the tenability of justice, which is why we’re meeting today, ” McDonald told RTÉ’s Today with Claire Byrne. 
Asked whether this equated to believing this position was untenable, McDonald said: “Where the Chief Justice has lost confidence in him, yes so I would have thought that is manifestly the case.”

Clarke’s letter which gave his opinon that Woulfe should step down came following the fallout from Woulfe’s attendance at the controversial Oireachtas Golf Society dinner in Clifden in August.
Clarke told Woulfe in a letter dated 5 November that it was “the unanimous view of all of the members of the Court” that the affair had caused “significant and irreparable damage” to the court.
The potential removal of a judge is possible under Article 35.4 of the Constitution for “stated misbehaviour”, but this would have to be approved by both the Dáil and Seanad.
Such an impeachment motion can be lodged by any TD for the above reason.
Earlier this week, Cabinet considered the correspondence between the Chief Justice and Woulfe and also sought advice from the Attorney General.
The Attorney General outlined the “serious constitutional issues” that have arisen. 
In a separate matter, The Irish Times reported this morning that the Cabinet was not told in July that a number of other judges had expressed interest in the vacancy on the Supreme Court before Woulfe was selected. 
Speaking on the matter, the Taoiseach said only one name is brought to Cabinet when a judge is being appointed.
Woulfe had come through the Judicial Appointments advisory board (JAB) process, he said. He said he was not told other judges had expressed interest. 
He said the advisory board is made up of senior judges themselves, and they had selected Woulfe. “As far as I’m concerned, that was it from from my perspective,” said Martin, adding that he had “no difficulty in ratifying that”. 
New legislation will deal with the appointment of judges into the future, said Martin.
“The less political involvement in the appointment of judges to better. And that’s why I was happy to stand back and say okay, JAB has made a nomination here. I’m happy to ratify that nomination,” he said.
Woulfe had been Attorney General to the previous government from 2017-2020.

772,234,"Pete Taylor seeks injunction to stop council evicting boxing club from premises",https://www.thejournal.ie/pete-taylor-wicklow-county-council-5265964-Nov2020/,"WELL-KNOWN BOXING coach Pete Taylor is seeking a High Court injunction preventing Wicklow County Council from evicting him and Bray Boxing Club from the premises it has used for 15 years.
Taylor, who is the father of Olympic and World Champion boxer Katie Taylor, claims the council is wrongfully trying to remove him and the club from a facility located at the Harbour Shed, Bray, Co Wicklow.
Represented by Richard Kean SC, with Gareth Robinson Bl instructed by solicitor Georgina Robinson, Taylor and the club have brought proceedings against Wicklow County Council, which owns the facility.
The claim was brought after the council allegedly changed the locks on the premises in June 2018 after three people, including Taylor, were shot at the gym.
One of those shot, Bobby Messett, was killed in the incident.
Taylor, the club and its members have been out of the facility since then.
At the High Court today, Kean said in 2005 Taylor secured the use of the premises, which had been used as a store shed by the local authority, for use as a boxing gym.
When it was taken over the premises lacked basic facilities. Over the years, the club has produced some top boxers including Katie Taylor, and enhanced and equipped the facility with the help of a sports capital grant.
In a sworn statement to the court, Taylor said in 2017 the council sought a large increase the annual rent it charged for the premises, which he thought was unfair given the facilities benefit to the local community.
In June 2018, Taylor said a violent incident occurred at the premises when a club member was shot and killed, another injured and he was shot in the arm.
The court heard that Taylor was “the innocent victim of a violent incident”. A few days later it is claimed that without prior warning the council changed the locks at the premises.
It is claimed that the council informed the club that it proposed to take possession of it and have it cleaned, fixed and restored for use as a sports’ facility.
Taylor claims that the council used that violent incident as a “smokescreen to unlawfully evict” him and the club from the premises.
He says that it was always his intention to return and operate the club as previously and the council was not entitled to re-take the property in the manner in which it has done for many years.
Despite attempts to resolve matters, the plaintiffs say they have been unable to re-gain entry to the property and several club members have had to make alternative arrangements.
Arising out of the council’s alleged actions Taylor and the club, of which he is a director sued the council.

Those proceedings are on-going and are due before the High Court later this month where his clients seeking judgement against the council in default over its alleged failure filing a defence to the claim.
Earlier this month, Taylor said he discovered that the council had posted an eviction notice outside the premises giving the club and Taylor 10 days to vacate the premises.
Taylor added in his statement that by serving the eviction notice the council is trying to circumvent and interfere with the ongoing legal action.
At the court, Kean said the club would not be able to source an alternative venue to store its equipment, which remains in the premises, during the Level 5 lockdown.
As a result, Taylor and the club seek an injunction preventing the council from terminating their legal interests in the club in the absence of a properly obtained court order.
The plaintiffs further seek an order from the court allowing them to re-enter the premises as well as declarations that the council is prevented from illegally evicting Mr Taylor and the club from the gym.
The matter came before Ms Justice Leonie Reynolds who, following an ex-parte application, granted the plaintiffs permission to serve short notice of the injunction application on the council.

The men, who are aged between 36 to 79 years and pleaded guilty in January, are named by Belfast Crown Court as Patrick Blair, Seamus Morgan, Joseph Lynch, Liam Hannaway, John Sheehy, Kevin Heaney and Terence Marks.
The most elderly of the men, Joseph Lynch, will be 80 in January and is from Limerick. He has 13 previous convictions in the Republic of Ireland dating between 1955 and 1996, the most serious being common assault.  
An eighth man who had pleaded guilty has since died.  
The offences for which the men were sentenced include membership of a proscribed organisation, preparation of terrorist acts, conspiracy to possess explosives and firearms, collecting information and providing terrorist training. 
In sentencing the defendants, Mr Justice Colton said the contents of the discussions made grim and depressing reading:
“It is the overwhelming wish and the expectation of all right-thinking law abiding citizens in this jurisdiction that the days of shootings, killings and explosions should be confined to the past.”
It is clear from the contents of the discussions of those who were present at the meetings described (to varying degrees) that they were willing to return us to the days which so disfigured our society. Those who seek to do so represent a grave danger to the community and those who commit crimes in furtherance of that objective must expect deterrent sentences.
The convictions relate to a PSNI operation targeting violent dissident republican activity which centred on a house in Ardcarn Park, Newry in 2014.

Speaking this afternoon, the PSNI’s Head of Serious Crime Detective Chief Superintendent Raymond Murray said the operation against the men was carried out over a “prolonged period of time” and involved MI5. 
“The tactics used included the use of covert audio devices which allowed us to gather comprehensive and compelling evidence which successfully defeated the fear inspired walls of silence which groups such as these try to use to frustrate the detection of their activities,” he said. 
Murray said the men were involved in a “multitude of conspiracies” that included robbery and intimidation. 
The plans, which were put forward as evidence, detailed the intention to carry out robberies on businessmen in the community using menaces which ranged through intimidation, destruction of property to kidnap and outright violence.

“Look, I don’t have precise knowledge on this yet because a lot depends on the clinical trials coming through the regulatory authorities in Europe and the FDA in the United States, and then going into distribution, logistics, and manufacturing as well.”
When asked if that estimate was based on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and other vaccines continuing to prove effective and pass regulatory checks, Martin said yes.
“To be fair, Pfizer for example have been saying for quite some time that they would be where they are now and they’re on target to be fair to them. Other companies, like the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine seems to be on target.

“A vaccine will be a vital tool for controlling the pandemic, and we’re encouraged by the preliminary results of clinical trials released this week,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, in closing the WHO’s annual assembly.
US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech announced this week that their candidate vaccine had proven 92% effective in ongoing final phase trials involving more than 40,000 people, less than a year after the novel coronavirus emerged.
“Never in history has vaccine research progressed so quickly. We must apply the same urgency and innovation to ensuring that all countries benefit from this scientific achievement,” said Tedros.
The EU’s vaccine order
The European Commission is to authorise a contract for up to 300 million doses of the BioNTech and Pfizer vaccine, which its President Ursula von der Leyen called “the most promising so far”.

It has also put in orders for three other vaccines in development: 300 million doses of the Oxford-AztraZeneca vaccine, with an option to buy 100 million more; up to 300 million doses of the Sanofi-GSK vaccine; and 200 million Janssen Pharmaceutica NV vaccines, with the possibility to purchase a further 200 million.

But has 2020 been that much better? The Scotland win was fortunate; the value of a Wales scalp in 2020 is considerably less than the 2019 version and while the 50-17 victory over Italy was comprehensive, what else would you have expected?
On the road there were times – the final quarter in Twickenham, the first half in Paris – when Ireland put together some impressive passages of play but in the remainder of those two games, you had to wonder if the level of tactical advice was as detailed as it used to be under Joe.
A case in point was the championship defining game, Antoine Dupont’s opening try resulting from a communications breakdown that left tighthead Andrew Porter to defend a one-on-one situation with France wing, Gael Fickou.

The third French try was even worse – a Johnny Sexton Garryowen leading to a swift counter-attack where Caelan Doris was outnumbered on the right flank, as Fickou, Dupont and try-scorer Romain Ntamack exploited a dubious kick-chase strategy.
Still, there has to be balance. Farrell has only had five games in charge and has won three of those. Schmidt, remember, lost two of his opening three internationals, albeit against top-class opposition, with the quality of his team’s 2013 display against the All Blacks putting credit in his account.
In this respect, the new coach could do with some big performances over the next month to make his own balance statement look a bit healthier – and the arrival of James Lowe should help irrespective of the canyon-like gap from the Pro14 to international rugby.
At least tonight against Wales [KO 7pm, RTÉ / Channel 4] we will finally get a glimpse of what life in the post Murray-Sexton era will look like – and not before time, as Murray is a pale resemblance of the Conor Murray circa 2016 while Sexton is now 35 and can’t go on forever.
Still a great competitor, the Ireland captain is not much of a running threat – well he never really was – which is a key reason why he needs his scrum half to fill that void. John Cooney is deadly around the fringes, so too Craig Casey and Kieran Marmion, so it is a bit of a surprise that Jamison Gibson-Park was allowed jump the queue.
Let’s give the Leinster combo the benefit of the doubt, though. The pairing may work. Something needs to.  Ireland have lacked consistency for too long now and need a spark from somewhere.
Taking Stock
In the history of international rugby, only seven Irishmen have scored more tries than Jacob Stockdale, which is an impressive enough stat before you even consider that his debut came as recently as June 2017.
So you kind of get it when a coaching team opts to stand by their man, not least because the Robbie Henshaw experiment at full-back started and ended over 80 painful minutes in February 2019 while you hardly need reminding of the number of candles on Rob Kearney’s birthday cake. Add in the fact that Jordan Larmour and Will Addison are injured and you can kind of see why Stockdale will be the one wearing 15 on his back tonight.
It needs to go better for him than it did in the Stade de France, though, when Stockdale wasn’t just out of position for three of France’s four tries but in a different Parisian postcode.

Some say he is suffering a crisis of confidence; others that it is a concentration issue. But against France, two weeks ago, and England when Elliot Daly scored in the 2019 Six Nations opener, it was simply a pick-the-ball-up-off-the-ground issue.
Still, let’s remember that in 2018 Ireland wouldn’t have won a Grand Slam or defeated the All Blacks without him. Can his management of the backfield and positional play improve? Well this is what the Irish coaching team are paid to do.
If they fail in their quest, then they’d be well advised to pick up the phone and dial Simon Zebo’s number.
Is Sexton a suitable captain?
The short answer is yes; the longer answer is yes, of course he bloody is. All this fuss about him shaking his head after he was subbed against the French reminds you of the time Ricky Hatton got asked about the roughhouse tactics he used to defeat Kosta Tszyu and become world champion.
“Well,” Hatton replied, “it’s not a tickling competition, is it?”
Nor is international rugby captaincy a study in diplomacy. If excessive politeness is what you crave from leaders then may I point you in the direction of Seasons One and Two of The Crown on Netflix. You should get your fill of that guff there.
Even if there was a suitable alternative to Sexton as captain – Peter O’Mahony is no longer guaranteed a starting slot, James Ryan is too quiet, Garry Ringrose too injured – there is certainly not a suitable alternative at out-half. So imagine Farrell – a new head coach, schooled in the say-it-as-it-is culture of Wigan in the ’90s – sacking his skipper because of an ill-judged scowl.
Maturely, the Ireland coach dealt with the situation well, knowing his team is best served with a competitor like Sexton as captain. “Johnny will be fine,” scrum coach, John Fogarty, said yesterday.  ”How he preps, the standards he drives, he has a will to win that is infectious at times. Sometimes it spills over but it is that competitive edge that drives some players on…I don’t worry about Johnny.”
Nor should he. There are enough things for Ireland to be concerned with.
Sexton unhappily leaves the field in Paris.

Are Wales one of those?
Not when you look at their 2020 form. They have lost five on the spin, lost their defence coach last weekend and have completely lost the aura they held under Warren Gatland. “If we keep working hard, we believe we can turn this around,” said their head coach Wayne Pivac on Wednesday.
The clock may already be ticking on him, though. At yesterday’s press conference, Alun Wyn Jones was asked questions about player unrest and who was responsible for the downward turn of events. Those sort of queries only ever come in times of crisis.
That is where Wales are right now, struggling to adjust to life after Warrenball, struggling at the breakdown, where they conceded 11 penalties against the Scots. “We need to start winning soon, there’s no doubt about that,” said Pivac after the Scotland defeat. It puts Ireland’s situation in perspective.
Managing to make change and continuity rhyme
One of the things Farrell has done well in his opening year is to promote understudies and integrate new players into his set-up without ever making this evolution feel like a revolution.
There has been a lot of change – James Lowe will become his eighth debutant tonight, replacement Billy Burns may well be the ninth – but it has always felt like a seamless transition from one team selection to the next.
Check out tonight’s team. You have Ronan Kelleher making his first start yet he’s doing so in familiar surroundings, an all Leinster front row there to keep him company.
It’s a similar situation for Gibson-Park, Leinster colleagues Doris and Sexton providing familiar faces at No8 and out-half for the scrum-half who wins just his third cap.  
Stockdale, Keenan and Lowe may sound like an estate agency; in fact they are Ireland’s back three, a debutant going in with a guy winning his third cap and another fella who is starting an international at full back for just the third time.
And you can see what Farrell is aiming at, trying to make change and continuity rhyme, opting for players who possess serious athletic ability, Kelleher an embodiment of this team’s new-look.
“Ronan is certainly someone we have huge belief in,” says Fogarty. “He’s an excellent ball carrier, an excellent defender and he’s strong in the set piece.
“The kid is young, and while there’s always going to be some patience with younger players, the thing is that he’s going to set himself some high standards. We expect him to perform as well.
“So definitely there’s a road that you go on, every game is a little bit different, the pressures of international rugby are a little bit different. It’s a journey we all go on.”
So far in 2020 they’ve hit a few potholes. But sports people do, Arnold Palmer famously noted. The road to success, Arnie told us, is always under construction.

THE WEST YORKSHIRE police have issued an apology to the relatives of Peter Sutcliffe’s victims for “the language, tone and terminology used by senior officers at the time”.
West Yorkshire Police Chief Constable John Robins has issued an apology today, responding to calls from the son of the Yorkshire Ripper’s first recognised victim.
Richard McCann had earlier appealed to West Yorkshire Police to make a formal apology for the way in which his mother and other victims of Sutcliffe were described by officers in the 1970s.
He said he wanted the force “once and for all” to “apologise to the families, who are still around, for the way in which they described some of the women as ‘innocent’, inferring that some were not innocent – including my mum.
“I’d invite them to make that apology,” adding that “it would set the records straight.”
McCann added: “I want her to be remembered as the mother of four children, the daughter of her parents. She was a family woman who, through no fault of her own, was going through adversity and made some bad decisions, some risky decisions.
She paid for those decisions with her life.

In a statement released  this afternoon, West Yorkshire Police Chief Constable John Robins said: “On behalf of West Yorkshire Police, I apologise for the additional distress and anxiety caused to all relatives by the language, tone and terminology used by senior officers at the time in relation to Peter Sutcliffe’s victims.
Such language and attitudes may have reflected wider societal attitudes of the day, but it was as wrong then as it is now.
“A huge number of officers worked to identify and bring Peter Sutcliffe to justice and it is a shame that their hard work was overshadowed by the language of senior officers used at the time, the effect of which is still felt today by surviving relatives.
“Thankfully those attitudes are consigned to history and our approach today is wholly victim focused, putting them at the centre of everything we do.”
He added: “I offer this heartfelt apology today as the Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police.”
Condolences to Carl Sutcliffe
McCann said he reached out to the serial killer’s brother “to offer my condolences” after hearing the news of his death.
He was only five years old when his mother, Wilma McCann, was murdered in 1975.
He revealed he had been in touch with one of Peter Sutcliffe’s brothers, Carl, following the news that the murderer had died in prison today.
McCann told the BBC: “I gave him a call when I got the news to offer my condolences.
“Carl Sutcliffe reached out to me many years ago when he read about my journey — he reached out to me with compassion and I felt the same.
“I know he obviously did some horrendous things but he was still his brother so I felt like I wanted to call him.”
He said news of Sutcliffe’s death had brought him “some degree of closure”, but that he had never wished him dead, nor was he celebrating the news.
He said: “Every time we hear a news story about him, and my mum’s photo is often shown, it’s just another reminder of what he did.”
He said “one positive” to come from Sutcliffe’s death is that “we’ll hear much less about him, and no more reminders about what happened all those years ago”.

Her son said he was left terrified after his mother’s death, and when Sutcliffe killed Jayne MacDonald, who also lived in his street.
McCann said: “I was convinced as a child, having had no therapy of any description, that he was out there and that he was going to kill me.”
He added: “It really affected me. I was ashamed of being associated with Sutcliffe and all his crimes and, possibly, to do with the way that lots of people in society looked down, and the police and some of the media – describing some of the women as innocent and some not so innocent.

Retired detective Roger Parnell, who worked on the Ripper inquiry, rejected accusations the officers “did not care less” about prostitute victims.
He told BBC Radio 5Live: “We certainly did, I can assure you we did.
“These ladies were wives, they were mothers, they were sisters. And the inquiry did not change at the murder of Jayne MacDonald.
“We were all determined from the beginning to catch the perpetrator of all these murders.
“When I heard this morning that Peter Sutcliffe had died, I just could not care less, to be honest.”

On Wednesday afternoon, a woman got into difficulty off the coast at Greystones.
The Greystones Guide retold the story of how two friends, 17-year-old Conor Power and Ciaran Fox, saw that the woman was struggling in the water.
Power, a trained lifeguard, got into the water to help the woman, while Fox called the Coast Guard.
Speaking on RTÉ Radio’s Today with Claire Byrne show this morning, Leaving Cert student Conor retold the story of how he helped to rescued the woman.
“Before I got in, I made sure that the Coast Guard was informed that someone was in the water in trouble,” he said.
He said he also surveyed the situation and got a rescue buoy before getting in. 
“Then I got into the water and reached the woman, and I told her to swim towards me because I could see that she was quite close to the rocks.
“She was that out of energy that I grabbed the buoy myself and towed her another 10 feet or so away from the rocks to safety until the Coast Guard came.”
Power then needed to get back to shore himself because the conditions were so bad; he told the woman to hang on to the buoy to stay afloat and returned to shore.

By the time he had returned to shore, the Gardaí had arrived and he informed them what happened. Power’s body temperature had dropped below 35 degrees after this, so an ambulance was called for him – but he said his temperature returned to normal up to an hour later. 
He said that his lifeguard training emphasised that it was important not to panic, and not to put your own life at risk when attempting to help people struggling in the water. 
“You are the most important person in a rescue,” said John Doyle, the head coach of Power’s lifesaving club, the Poseidon Lifesaving Club.
He also told the Claire Byrne programme that half of people who drown had gone into the water to help someone else.
“[Conor] realised he could not get her out, so he did what he could by bringing her off the rocks, and then got himself out of danger – which is something we try to drill into our club members.”","The Coast Guard had been called before the teen, who has lifeguard training, got into the water.",17,0,0,23111,"Nov 13th 2020, 2:33 PM"

HEALTHCARE WORKERS HAVE been betrayed by Stormont’s “negligent” decision not to impose a fresh lockdown, a senior doctor said.
British Medical Association Northern Ireland chair Dr Tom Black warned that hospitals are over-capacity; Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the situation in Northern Ireland was “very challenging” as the pressures on the system are “fairly significant there”.
Circuit-breaker restrictions have been extended by one week, with partial reopening of hospitality next Friday, following a political wrangle which has exposed divisions between the parties in the executive. 
Dr Black said: “The national response to a situation like that would be to bring in a further lockdown, to make that more severe, yet politicians have decided to ease restrictions over the next two weeks and open up society.
“That decision is incompetent and negligent and saying to the healthcare workers that ‘we are abandoning you’.
“If the healthcare workers thought that they had been betrayed by the Executive, I think that would be a reasonable stance to take.”
‘Wrong’ for DUP to use veto
Taoiseach Micheál Martin told RTÉ the News at One that helping to tackle the coronavirus pandemic in Northern Ireland was “challenging”.
There are different political parties around the Executive. They have differences on this. Their Chief Medical Officer liaises with out Chief Medical Officer – but also is connected to the UK medical system. So, from the get go, we’ve had this different set of perspectives.
He said that the DUP using the cross-community veto to block the extension of Covid-19 restrictions was “wrong”.

You cannot be using the cross-community veto in the context of a public health initiative. That is not what it was ever designed for, and I was very disappointed to see that… Public health should transcend that.
The Taoiseach said that he was “glad” that they were continuing their restrictions because “their numbers are worryingly high” and “the spillover effect is there”.
He cited one example of when North-South cooperation was effective, though it was an ‘informal’ arrangement: “One time when we got Donegal and Strabane and Derry all on one wavelength, because of informal workings with the systems in the North and the Republic – that was good.”
Alliance and Sinn Féin react
Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said that the tactics being used were  ”shameful and embarrassing”, refencing the DUP’s use of the cross-community veto to block the extension of restrictions for two weeks. 
“The degree of perversion of the original intent of that protection is laid bare for all to see,” she said. 
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald echoed those comments speaking later on RTÉ’s Today with Claire Byrne. 
“I think the use by the DUP of a cross-community vote and a veto which is what Naomi was referring, to was shameful was disgraceful was depressing. The idea that the DUP can turn public health and our need to keep all of us safe and to do the right thing for everyone in very difficult circumstances, that they can turn that into an orange versus green, them versus us issue is, really very very shocking,” she said.

Taoiseach: Advice on travelling home from abroad for Christmas will be given at end of November
A total of 78 deaths involving Covid-19 occurred in the week from 31 October to 6 November, and the overall toll has reached 1,141, official statistics showed today.
On Thursday, at the 11th hour, a deal was struck by the Executive to end the deadlock over exiting the current coronavirus circuit-breaker.
Hair and beauty salons and premises without an alcohol licence like cafes and coffee shops can reopen next Friday, with hours restricted to 8pm.
Driving lessons can resume by appointment only.
Restaurants, pubs and hotels can lift shutters on November 27.
Pubs and bars will be permitted to sell sealed off-sales from November 20.
Northern Ireland Hotels Federation (NIHF) chief executive Janice Gault said her sector had lost out.
Turnover is forecast to fall to less than a third of 2019 and the extended six-week closure will see a loss of sales in the region of £70 million.

She added: “From a hotel perspective, it has been a bleak month with frustration morphing into exasperation over the last week.
“The air of despondency at the start of the process has been replaced with one of disbelief and distress.”
Sinn Féin voted against the successful proposal because it ran contrary to the guidance from Stormont’s medical and scientific advisers to extend the circuit-break in its entirety for two weeks.
It was outnumbered around the ministerial table as ministers faced mounting public criticism over the delay.
The DUP, Ulster Unionists and Alliance Party voted for the breakthrough proposals.

But he added that it would not be like Christmas last year: “I get the sense from public they know it’ll be different, that not everybody – if I use the phrase – ‘will be on the lash’ for Christmas, and we won’t have office parties that people might have had in previous years.”
He said that he did believe churches would be open for Christmas week, saying that the weeks leading up to Christmas were also important and that it was important for people’s mental health.

CMO says travel home to spend time with family for Christmas is considered 'non-essential'
Martin said the preference was to come out of Level 5 nationally, but said that areas such as Donegal were a “concern”. He said that more effort was needed, “from a communications point of view”, to reduce the cases in that county down further.
Donegal’s 14-day incidence rate is currently 281.4 cases per 100,000 – a slight decrease from 286.4 cases per 100,000 last week, and far above the national rate of 145.
There has been confusion about what preparations should be made about the Christmas period, after Tánaiste Leo Varadkar told the Dáil that people should wait before booking flights home to Ireland, while the Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan went a step further last night, saying that flying home for Christmas was not essential.
“We think people should avoid non-essential travel and continue to do so for the foreseeable future,” Dr Holohan said, adding that inter-county travel would be decided on at the end of the month.

It was the first reported incident of large-scale civilian fatalities in a week-old conflict between the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) party and the government of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, winner of last year’s Nobel Peace Prize.
The Amnesty report came the same day Abiy said government forces had made gains in western Tigray, and as thousands of Ethiopians continued to flee across the border into neighbouring Sudan, stoking fears of a humanitarian crisis.
“Amnesty International can today confirm… that scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death in Mai-Kadra (May Cadera) town in the South West Zone of Ethiopia’s Tigray Region on the night of 9 November,” the rights group said in a report.
Amnesty said it had “digitally verified gruesome photographs and videos of bodies strewn across the town or being carried away on stretchers”.
The dead “had gaping wounds that appear to have been inflicted by sharp weapons such as knives and machetes,” Amnesty said, citing witness accounts.
Witnesses said the attack was carried out by TPLF-aligned forces after a defeat at the hands of the Ethiopian military, though Amnesty said it “has not been able to confirm who was responsible for the killings”.
There was no immediate reaction from the TPLF, which dominated national politics for nearly three decades before Abiy took office in 2018.
Abiy ordered military operations in Tigray on 4 November, saying they were prompted by a TPLF attack on federal military camps – a claim the party denies.
The region has been under a communications blackout ever since.
Officials say hundreds have been killed and analysts are warning of a bloody, protracted civil war in Africa’s second-most populous country.

Fleeing refugees 
In a Facebook post Thursday, Abiy said government forces had “liberated” the western zone of Tigray – made up of six zones, plus the capital and surrounding areas.
Abiy also accused TPLF-aligned fighters of “cruelty”, saying that when the army took control of the town of Sheraro they “found bodies of executed defence force personnel whose hands and feet were tied”.
Regional state media in Tigray countered that pro-TPLF forces had retaken territory earlier seized by federal forces.
The report also said TPLF forces had “captured” 10,000 soldiers.
The conflict has seen multiple rounds of airstrikes targeting arms and fuel depots along with heavy fighting in western Tigray.
The UN says some 11,000 Ethiopians have sought refuge in neighbouring Sudan, which says it will house the influx in a camp for victims of a 1980s famine.
Exhausted refugees, mostly women, youths and children, arrived on foot or by bicycle and motorised rickshaw, a correspondent for AFP reported from the Hamdait border area of Sudan’s eastern Kassala state.
Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok has called for a “stop to the fighting as soon as possible” and a return to the negotiating table.
The African Union has also called for an immediate stop to fighting and dialogue.
But Ethiopia reiterated Thursday that the “cruelty” of the TPLF “cannot be addressed or redressed by sitting at a table for a negotiation”.
Lawmakers have approved a plan to install a “caretaker administration” in Tigray assuming the federal government can assert control over the region.
On Thursday they voted to lift the immunity of 39 TPLF members including Tigray regional president Debretsion Gebremichael, though the significance of the move was unclear given that TPLF MPs resigned en masse last month.
State media later reported that arrest warrants had been issued against Debretsion and other TPLF leaders “for endangering the country’s existence” and “for trying to erode the constitution”.
Humanitarian worries 
There are mounting worries about how Tigray’s population is faring.

The United Nations yesterday called for Ethiopia to provide full humanitarian access to Tigray and enable civilians to flee safely, after warning the day before that otherwise “food, health and other emergency supplies have no way to make it into the region”.
Spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters Ethiopia humanitarian coordinator Catherine Sozi was discussing “immediate and unimpeded humanitarian access” with the government.
“We are also calling for the safe passage for civilians in search of safety and assistance and to guarantee the security for all aid workers,” he said.
Abiy said on Facebook that “the army is giving humanitarian aid” in western Tigray.
William Davison, an analyst for the International Crisis Group, said the TPLF had “significant support” from the people and efforts to remove them would meet “considerable resistance”.
Long-running tensions between Abiy and the TPLF hit a new low in September when Tigray pressed ahead with its own elections, insisting Abiy was an illegitimate leader after national polls were postponed due to the coronavirus.
Hundreds turned out Thursday morning in the capital Addis Ababa for a blood drive to support troops fighting in Tigray.
“The attack done by TPLF to our army is shameful for Ethiopia. Never happened in our history. We want to condemn this,” Mayor Adanech Abebe told AFP as she donated blood.
War crimes 
The UN rights chief called for a full inquiry into possible war crimes in Ethiopia after reports emerged of the massacre of civilians in the Tigray region.
“If confirmed as having been deliberately carried out by a party to the current fighting, these killings of civilians would of course amount to war crimes,” Michelle Bachelet said in a statement, calling for “full accountability”.
Bachelet expressed alarm at reports that water and electricity supplies had been cut and called for both sides to begin peace talks, saying “there will be no winner” if fighting continues.
“A protracted internal conflict will inflict devastating damage on both Tigray and Ethiopia as a whole undoing years of vital development progress,” she said.
“It could, in addition, all too easily spill across borders, potentially destabilising the whole sub-region.”","A man lies down after giving blood at a blood drive in support of the country’s military, at a stadium in the capital Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Thursday,",6,0,0,17160,"Nov 13th 2020, 12:06 PM"

Dozens of cars were destroyed by the fire at Douglas Shopping Centre in the city on 1 September 2019. 
There were no casualties or injuries in the huge blaze, which started when one vehicle in the car park caught fire.
The fire was contained to one section of the centre’s multi-storey car park, but a large number of parked vehicles were damaged or destroyed and a significant amount of damage was also caused to the building.
The shopping centre is reopening for the first time since the incident today.  
“We’re very excited and we’re full of emotion,” Bartosz Mieszala, the centre’s manager, told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland. 
Tesco was the first store in the centre to open its doors yesterday morning at 8am. Marks & Spencer opened at 9am. 
A number of other essential shops also reopened, including two pharmacies and three coffee shops for takeaway.

Typhoon Vamco passed north of Manila between Bulacan and Pampanga provinces overnight on Wednesday into early yesterday, toppling power poles and trees and damaging homes.
More than 350,000 people had been evacuated to safety, mainly residents fleeing vulnerable coastal and low-lying areas before the typhoon hit.
Philippine National Police said more than 100,000 people had been rescued, including 41,000 in the capital region.

In a statement marking the mid-point of Level 5 restrictions, which kicked in on 22 October, Martin said data suggests that the efforts in place are working. 
“Now that we have reached the mid-point of the enhanced Level 5 restrictions, I would like to pay tribute to the great national effort that is underway to suppress the virus and bring down the rate of infection across all communities,” Martin said. 
Health officials yesterday evening confirmed 395 further cases of Covid-19 and one more death. 
A total of 362 new cases were confirmed on Wednesday and 270 new cases were confirmed on Tuesday. 
That is a total of 1,027 cases compared to 1,357 cases over the same period last week and 2,261 cases the week previously. 
Ireland’s reproductive number last week was estimated at between 0.7 and 0.9 having been at around 1 the previous week. It has since fallen further to 0.6. 
Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan has said a reproductive number of 0.5 over a sustained period would be a sufficient level of transmission to move out of strict restrictions.  
In his statement, the Taoiseach said “we are one of the leaders in Europe in terms of our progress in pushing back the virus”. 
However, he added that “we must see this through”. 
“By continuing to drive down the incidence of the disease, we give ourselves the best chance to reopen parts of our society and to enjoy a meaningful Christmas,” he said. 
Martin’s statement comes as Dr Holohan yesterday said people should regard travel home for Christmas as non-essential.

Halfway through Level 5, what does this week's Covid-19 data tell us?
The CMO said he agreed with comments made earlier in the day by Tánaiste Leo Varadkar that it is “too soon” for people to book flights home to Ireland for Christmas. 
Dr Holohan said health officials are “concerned about the picture in other countries relative to where we are here”.
“Unfortunately many other countries in Europe are still in a deteriorating situation,” he said, adding that many of the countries people would be travelling back from for Christmas have much higher levels of infection.
Frontline workers
In his statement today, Taoiseach Micheál Martin also paid tribute to Ireland’s frontline workers and young people. 
“Our frontline workers continue to be an inspiration in terms of their courage and commitment,” Martin said. 
“I would like to pay particular tribute to our young people for the successful suppression of their virus among their age group,” he said.

“They are missing out on a lot, but their time will come and they should take great pride in the effort they are making to protect the more vulnerable in our society,” the Taoiseach added. 
Martin said he is “acutely conscious of how difficult the current restrictions are for everyone, and the very heavy price being paid by many sectors of our economy”.

The 191 cases added to the country’s caseload represented the sixth consecutive day of over 100 infections and the highest daily increase since 4 September.
More than 120 of the cases were from the Seoul metropolitan area, where the coronavirus has spread in a variety of places, including hospitals, nursing homes, churches, schools, restaurants and offices.
The steady spread of the virus has alarmed government officials, who eased social distancing measures to the lowest level since October to soften the pandemic’s shock on the economy.
While this has allowed high-risk venues like nightclubs and karaoke bars to reopen, prime minister Chung Sye-Kyun during a virus meeting today said the viral spread could force the government to “seriously consider” tightening social distancing again.
“We are at a precarious situation,” he said, pleading for citizen vigilance and for labour unionists and civic groups to cancel planned rallies.

Cummings told the BBC that “rumours of me threatening to resign are invented” after speculation that he would follow communications director Lee Cain in leaving Number 10.
However, he said that his “position hasn’t changed since my January blog” when he wrote that he hoped to make himself “largely redundant” by the end of 2020.
The BBC also quoted a Downing Street source as saying Cummings would be “out of Government” by Christmas.
It comes just a day after a bitter power struggle in Number 10 led to the resignation of Cain.
He had been offered the post of chief of staff but a backlash among Tories and Johnson’s inner circle ultimately led him on Wednesday to announce his departure from Number 10 rather than a promotion.
Cummings and Cain are close political allies, having worked together since the Brexit campaign. Cummings was said to be unhappy with the way his friend had been treated.
The Telegraph reported an “associate” of Cain as saying the communication chief’s departure was the “beginning of the end for Dom”.
“Lee is the person who has been covering Dom’s flank 24 hours a day and he will soon be gone,” the source told the paper.

Conservative MPs have urged Johnson to use events to reshape the team inside Downing Street and reconnect with the parliamentary party, some of whom feel he has been “lost” to advisers over the past year.
Charles Walker, vice chairman of the 1922 Committee, told BBC Two’s Newsnight: “If Boris, the Prime Minister, gets the chief of staff position right – he gets the right person in that position – he will plant his standard firmly back in the middle of the Conservative parliamentary party.
“We feel we’ve lost him for the last year. We want him back – he belongs to us, he doesn’t belong to the advisers, he belongs to the parliamentary party that elected him and he got elected at the last general election.”
The infighting spilling into the open sparked criticism from Tory MPs.
Conservative backbencher Sir Roger Gale told the PA news agency: “The Government, and Downing Street particularly, should be concentrating all of its efforts on the pandemic and on the end game of Brexit, and frankly this is a distraction that cannot and should not be allowed to take place and the Prime Minister has got to get a grip on it.”
And senior Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood told Sky News: “Let’s move a little bit away from Eastenders and more to the West Wing.”

The Prime Minister’s official spokesman James Slack, who confirmed he would be replacing Cain when he departs in the new year, insisted that Johnson was not being distracted from the national crisis by the bitter row.
“You’ve seen from the Prime Minister this week that he’s absolutely focused on taking all the steps that are required to equip the country to beat coronavirus,” the spokesman said on Thursday.
Slack, a former Daily Mail journalist who also served as Theresa May’s official spokesman when she led the country, said he would remain a civil servant when he succeeds Cain.
In his resignation statement, Cain confirmed he had been offered a promotion to the key position of the Prime Minister’s chief of staff.
The move – which would have meant he was one of just a handful of people in No 10 with direct one-to-one access to Johnson – was seen as entrenching the grip of the Vote Leave faction on the Downing Street operation.
However, it ran into immediate resistance, with Johnson’s fiancee, Carrie Symonds – who has clashed in the past with Cummings – reportedly strongly opposed to the appointment.
Symonds is a former Tory press chief who has served as a special adviser in previous governments.
Allegra Stratton, the former broadcaster brought in to host televised No 10 news conferences from next year, was also said to have objected to the appointment.","Cummings and Lee Cain are close political allies, having worked together since the Brexit campaign.",11,0,0,27957,"Nov 13th 2020, 7:15 AM"

Their messages came hours after President Donald Trump once again cried foul, retweeting a baseless claim that an election equipment maker “deleted” 2.7 million votes for him nationwide.
Biden, who leads by more than five million in the popular vote, cemented his victory late Thursday by winning Arizona, US networks said, flipping the state Democratic for the first time since 1996. 
Arizona gives Biden a 290-217 lead over Trump in the Electoral College, with 270 needed to win the White House.
With most Republican lawmakers having yet to acknowledge Biden’s win, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the chamber’s top Democrat, accused them yesterday of “denying reality” and “auditioning for profiles in cowardice”.
“Instead of working to pull the country back together so that we can fight our common enemy Covid-19, Republicans in Congress are spreading conspiracy theories, denying reality and poisoning the well of our democracy,” he said.
Senior US federal and state election officials meanwhile in a statement rejected Trump’s claims of fraud, saying that “the November 3rd election was the most secure in American history”.
The statement was issued by the Election Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council, a public-private umbrella group under the primary federal election security body, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).
“There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised,” they said.
While we know there are many unfounded claims and opportunities for misinformation about the process of our elections, we can assure you we have the utmost confidence in the security and integrity of our elections, and you should too.
It was signed by the heads of the National Association of State Election Directors and the National Association of Secretaries of State – the officials who manage elections at the state level – and by the chairman of the US Election Assistance Commission.
‘Absurd circus’
The statement came just hours after Trump’s retweet, which in addition to claiming 2.7 million “deleted” votes also said hundreds of thousand had been switched from him to Biden in Pennsylvania and other states.

It was the latest in a series of bogus assertions Trump and Republicans have put forth in order to reject Biden’s victory.
Republican lawmakers such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have stood firm with Trump by supporting his refusal to concede and backing his legal challenges.
Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi weighed in yesterday to demand Republicans stop what she called an “absurd circus” and turn to combatting the pandemic.
“Now that the people have expressed their views, Joe Biden has won (and) Kamala Harris will be the first woman vice president of the United States,” Pelosi said. 
Political experts believe Republicans may be invoking such a strategy as a way to rile up Trump’s base before two US Senate runoff elections in Georgia that will determine which party controls the chamber.
A total of 161 former national security officials, including some who worked with Trump, additionally warned the current administration’s continued delay in recognising Biden’s victory is posing “a serious risk to national security.”
In a letter, the group including ex-Pentagon chief Chuck Hagel and Trump’s former National Security Council senior counterterrorism director Javed Ali urged General Services Administration chief Emily Murphy to recognise Biden as the apparent president-elect.

But we shouldn’t fool ourselves that the politics of polarisation and lowest common denominator debate is exclusive to the United States.
Trumpian politics here?
The events of the last week have convinced me that we are entering a Trumpian era of divided politics in Ireland.
There were two opportunistic debates in the Houses of the Oireachtas this week. One was called by Sinn Féin about Leo Varadkar sharing the proposed GP contract with a friend; the other called by Fine Gael about Sinn Féin using UK legislation to avoid being answerable for a political donation from an unusual source of over €4.5m.
Both of these questions are serious issues – they go to the heart of how our democracy functions. The actions need to be addressed. But the debates, for the most part, were not about the substantive issues that they raised.
This was an opportunity for battlelines to be drawn and the rehearsed lines and soundbites to be delivered – and more importantly, for the armies of unquestioning social media loyalists to go to war.
It would suit both parties to clear everyone else out of the way and prepare for a head-to-head, divisive confrontation on the political battlefield in the years ahead.
The no-confidence motion
Sinn Féin TD Chris Andrews made clear in a tweet that the purpose of their no-confidence motion was not about the issue at hand but rather about making Fianna Fáil TDs feel uncomfortable supporting Leo Varadkar.
For parties in the political centre, including Fianna Fáil, this does make life difficult. As a party that believes in political compromise and appealing to those with different shades of opinion, operating in an increasingly black and white world poses challenges.
In the era of the short attention span, a nuanced policy position based on a “Shared Island” cannot compete with Sinn Féin slogans around a “Border Poll Now” nor can concepts around structured investment in public services compete with Fine Gael lines of “we will cut your taxes”.
It cannot be denied either that Fianna Fáil’s social media has not been at the races. We are a traditional broadsheet newspaper party competing with TikTok-savvy political operations.
But this discussion must be about more than just channels of political communication. It has to be about the nature of political debate in Ireland.
There is a dismissive attitude in Ireland to the idea that our society and politics could ever get as divisive as that in the United States. But growing evidence suggests otherwise. 
I would hazard that there are very few people in Ireland who could name every judge on our Supreme Court. I’d even be willing to bet that the majority of the population would struggle to name a single member, besides the one who has been in the news a lot this week. 
This is in contrast to the United States where not alone are judges known but their political views well studied and debated in the media and online. That could never happen here?
No opposing views allowed?
During the formation of the government earlier this year, there was speculation that the Green Party was to suggest one of their members who is a barrister as Attorney General. The story was untrue but it did not prevent a social media storm of anger because the individual had apparently voted against the repeal of the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.
The suggestion that we could have an Attorney General who may have been pro-life riled sections of the Irish twitterati and also some in public life. Green TD Neasa Hourigan stated that “as an active Repeal campaigner, this would not be an acceptable appointment to me.”
I do not know the barrister concerned, but in the appointment of an Attorney General, I expect that the primary requirement is that they have sufficient legal expertise to advise the government.
Their personal views must not cloud their professional opinion – they cannot be the pro-life Attorney General, but it should not be a bar if they are an Attorney General who happens also to be pro-life (or pro-choice for that matter).
Where historically, we had shared public spaces for debate, there is increasingly a tendency to retreat into echo chambers. For those in politics, an individual is labelled as being from a particular camp and hence is assumed to have a particular set of views. 
Politics is supposed to be about compromise. It is about bringing different approaches and ideas together and getting agreement that best serves our society as a whole. It has to be about persuasion, about convincing others of the merits of your argument while at the same time being willing to move to achieve a greater goal.
Compromise vs tech-fuelled noise
The Good Friday Agreement and the Peace Process. The European Union. These are political compromises that offer more hope than the alternatives of war, division and tribes at each others’ throats. As ours is a democracy with proportional representation, it is a much fairer system of reflecting the public mood than a winner takes all approach.
No political party won a majority in February’s election yet there are some of the electorates who believe that their vote represents either the majority position or the only acceptable vote and they do not believe that the opinions of other voters hold the same weight as theirs.
The rise of the #notmytaoiseach hashtag was deeply concerning. If Mary Lou MacDonald were ever to form a government, having built a coalition and obtained a majority in our elected national parliament, I would recognise her as the leader of this country and wish her well in the role.
That does not mean that I would not interrogate and challenge her policies or actions, but I would not question her legitimacy in the office.
Technology is transforming our lives, mostly in positive ways, but I fear that in public discourse, it is ushering us into an era where we are more comfortable in the bubble of those with whom we share the same views and cheering when one of our “people” attack those in another bubble.
Recognition is given to the one who “stands up” to the other side, while scorn is reserved for those who believe in working toward a consensus. It will be interesting to read the comments section on this piece to see how many have actually engaged in the arguments as opposed to trotting out the same old personalised attacks.
A clever tweet is not a substitute for an evidence-based and well-researched policy paper or opinion piece. As a society, we have little concept of digital citizenship, including of how we should behave online (it should differ little to real life where we should seek to understand those with alternative views and engage in respectful debate).
The traditional media are subject to high levels of regulation and journalistic standards, particularly around the political debate, but social media has few standards (even self-regulation is minimal). 
Much journalism is increasingly behind paywalls, while you can get any opinion you want online. Collectively, we need to ensure that we can restore safe public spaces, including online, where ideas are debated and political engagement leading to solutions can be encouraged.
There is a part to be played by policymakers in regulation, but each of us (and I include myself) must reflect on what we can do to help achieve this objective. If we don’t, the very nature of our democracy is under threat.
We also need to celebrate the diversity of political opinion in Irish society and encourage co-operation between those of different viewpoints. ‘Crossing the aisle’ should be commended, not greeted with cries of treachery.
It will not be healthy if Irish political debate is reduced to a well-scripted bare-knuckle battle between Fine Gael and Sinn Féin.

In a 17-page ruling last month, the DPC found that the prison service illegally compelled officers to provide their thumbprints to operate security gates at Castlerea Prison, Co Roscommon.
Data Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon found that the prison service had not established a legal basis for the processing of officers’ biometric data.
The ruling followed a complaint by an officer at Castlerea to the prison’s management and the Prison Officers Association last year that providing biometric data was against the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
The officer was told that the system was agreed by prison management and unions, and that he would face disciplinary action if he did not agree to supply his data.
He then made a protected disclosure to the DPC, which launched an investigation into the prison service’s use of biometric data.
Papers filed in the High Court on Tuesday show that the Minister for Justice and the Irish Prison Service have sought to overturn the DPC’s ruling.
The Minister and the prison service are represented by the Chief Prosecution Solicitor of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The case is listed for mention on 7 December.
As part of the DPC investigation, the Irish Prison Service claimed the use of biometric data was legal because the security system was covered under a Law Enforcement Directive.
The directive would allow the prison service to process personal data for the purposes of preventing or prosecuting crime, but the Irish Prison Service’s argument was rejected by the DPC in its findings last month.
The Irish Prison Service directed queries about the case by TheJournal.ie to the Department of Justice and Equality. The Department issued a response based on a reply by Minister Helen McEntee to a Parliamentary Question about the matter yesterday. 
“Following an examination of the findings and further to the advices of the Office of the Attorney General, a decision has now been taken to bring an appeal on certain aspects of those findings to the High Court,” the minister said.

“In light of this it would not be appropriate to comment any further at this time.
“Other findings of the Commission and specific directions to Irish Prison Service are not being appealed however, and I am further informed that the Irish Prison Service is taking steps to comply with the directions of the DPC in that regard.”
The minister added that it was her understanding that the DPC’s ruling were “preliminary findings” rather than a decision, and said biometric data was processed by the Irish Prison Service in other circumstances.

Republic of Ireland 0
STEPHEN KENNY SAYS he wants to break Ireland’s association with a “British-style”, but sadly for him, England left it behind years ago. 
Tonight Ireland were utterly outclassed at Wembley by Gareth Southgate’s vibrant and multivalent England, looking rigid and one-paced in comparison.
A bright Irish start was buried by first-half goals from Harry Maguire and Jadon Sancho, with Dominic Calvert-Lewin adding a third from the penalty spot.
As with all of the games under Kenny so far, there were positives – Ireland’s opening quarter and the late impact made by Jayson Molumby – but once again it’s an exercise in cross-examining a bad result.
In fairness, the result and performance is caveated by Ireland’s latest clatter of absentees, and the morning of the game brought further evidence Stephen Kenny may have signed his Ireland contract on a fairy fort. Seamus Coleman and James McCarthy missed out through injury and family reasons respectively, compounding the prior unavailability of Enda Stevens, Aaron Connolly, and Callum Robinson. 
Then, just ten minutes into this game, he lost one of his centre-backs to a head injury.
It at least allowed Wembley be the stage for the most GAA-sounding substitution in Irish soccer history, as Dara O’Shea replaced John Egan. 
10 minutes later, the plight of the other starting centre-back was on view. Of all the defensive scenarios Ireland might have felt comfortable dealing with ahead of this game, it’s of Shane Duffy being challenged in the air by Harry Maguire.
Not so, as Maguire  threw himself high in the air and headed the ball above Duffy and beyond Randolph. Duffy arrived into the game dreadfully out of form, and he had several chastening moments tonight, most notably his dallying on the ball in the box and being robbed by Dominic Calvert-Lewin, though his recovery averted no greater disaster than a corner. 
As the first half wore slowly on, he did eventually win a couple of aerial challenges with Maguire in the box, but they merely prefaced England’s second goal. 
Duffy cleared a Winks hoik into the box, but Cyrus Christie’s follow up was tame, which allowed England keep the ball and shift the ball left to Jack Grealish. Kenny said in the build-up to the game he wouldn’t be dwelling on the fact Grealish and Declan Rice were opponents, but dwelling is a skill mastered by Grealish.
He glided forward, held on to the ball for just long enough to hold Jeff Hendrick’s attention, and then popped the ball left to Jason Sancho to fire the ball low beyond Randolph. 
Grealish really was majestic at times, and Christie was forced to block a Sancho effort after Grealish picked him out with a gorgeous arcing pass through a gap in the Irish defence. 
The sophistication of England’s first-half play was too much for Ireland, with Sancho and Grealish drifting across the Irish defence, pressing it for weak points.

Ireland could hardly quibble with the half-time score reading 2-0, as they fell into survival mode from the moment they fell behind. Even Kenny Cunningham, whose RTE commentary was generous to Ireland, said the players’ job after the second goal was to ensure “things don’t fall apart.”
Prior to the first goal Ireland played quite well, with Alan Browne’s deft touch and Daryl Horgan’s direct running causing England issues in transition. 
Jack Grealish and Jadon Sancho celebrate England's second goal.

Twice Horgan drilled promising low crosses across the box, but the first was cut out by Maguire and the second went untouched, with Adam Idah caught on his heels six yards back. 
Ultimately, however, Ireland trotted off for the break without even managing a shot on target. And while Ireland poked and prodded and found ways around England’s high press in the opening quarter, that ability deserted them once England found their rhythm. 
Ireland opened up slightly in the second half, which allowed England cut through them at will. Saka, Reece James and Dominic Calvert-Lewin all had chances in the first five minutes of the second half. Shortly after, Conor Hourihane gave the ball away and Ireland didn’t see it again until Randolph stooped to pick a Dominic Calvert-Lewin penalty out of the net. 
The offence was Cyrus Christie’s, who clipped Saka in the box. Kenny and Southgate emptied their benches shortly after, and Ireland’s first shot on target came on the 71-minute mark. Jayson Molumby slipped through Alan Browne, who saw his shot blocked by the replacement goalkeeper Dean Henderson. 
Molumby injected a dose of energy into the Irish midfield, and a driving run 10 minutes later allowed Curtis sting Henderson’s gloves.
These shots are worth recording: they were as much as Ireland offered. It’s England’s first win over Ireland since 1985, albeit a record caveated by the fact these sides have played so rarely since the mid-90s. 
But Ireland voluntarily decided to take this game, and at times we were haunted by Sepp Blatter’s cackling voice.
They asked for that. Really.

Another 33,470 lab-confirmed cases of Covid-19 were recorded in the 24 hours before 9am today, according to the latest British government figures.
A further 563 people died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus as of today.
Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said the highest rates of infections were among younger generations.
But she said: “Worryingly it is rising quickly in those over 80 who are most at risk of poor outcomes.
“The current measures are in place to help protect all of us, and anyone can suffer serious illness from this virus.
“The majority of cases reported today were from tests carried out on the 9th and 10th of November, which includes infections acquired in the days leading up to new measures on the 5th November.
“Limiting contact with others will help to stop the spread of the virus and protect the people we love.”
However Professor Stephen Powis, NHS England’s medical director, played down the increase at a Downing Street press conference on Thursday evening.
He said: “It is important to look at the number of cases reported over a number of days and not just take one day in isolation.
“It is clear that infection rates have been going up. What is really important is to get those infection rates down.”
He said it was “too early to say” whether England’s national lockdown was having an effect, but warned people not to expect life to return to normal when restrictions are lifted on December 2.

“We will not be going back completely to normal – there will need to be other measures in place because while this virus is still here, we need to ensure that infection rates stay as low as possible and that we reduce the chance of transmission.”
Separately, research by Imperial College London’s React study suggested around 100,000 new coronavirus infections were occurring per day in England at the start of the second lockdown last week.
Experts said infections rose sharply across the country with more than one in 80 people infected, double that reported in early October. They observed a drop in prevalence at the end of October but then a quick uptick at the start of November.
A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: “As we have seen throughout this pandemic, there can be daily fluctuations in data so it is important to avoid drawing conclusions from one day’s figures. We must instead focus on the wider trend which is increasing, particularly in those at highest risk of disease.
“There was a rise in infections prior to national restrictions being brought in place and it is vital everyone continues to follow the guidance and takes care to wash hands, wear face coverings and reduce social contact – all of which proved to be highly effective in bringing down transmission rates earlier this year.”","Another 33,470 cases were confirmed today across the UK along with 563 further deaths.",5,0,0,47886,"Nov 12th 2020, 9:41 PM"

The money was secured through the Dormant Accounts Fund, and will be used to support technology, study space, health and social impact, and caring responsibilities.
Minister for Further and Higher Education Simon Harris said that this ring-fenced funding aims to address the implications that the Covid-19 pandemic will have on Travellers’ progression in Higher Education.
It aims to ensure expected increases in Traveller participation in higher education remain “on track”.
The Department of Higher Education cites recent studies that say there are only 61 Travellers in higher education, and approximately 1% of Travellers have a third-level education.
Harris said the funding is expected “to have a significant positive impact on Traveller access to and retention in higher education”.
“It is important to be able to safeguard increases in participation in higher education by the Traveller community during this pandemic and mitigate against the risk of long-term damage arising from Covid-19.
“I look forward to working with and engaging with higher education institutions and local and national Traveller organisations to ensure the successful roll-out of the actions in the Action Plan for Increasing Traveller Participation in Higher Education.”
Irish Travellers are  under-represented in higher education, and one of the target groups identified by the National Access Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education.
The target of 80 Travellers in higher education, from a baseline of 35 was set for the duration of the NAP for Traveller participation.

The progress review of the NAP in 2018 highlighted the need for a more focussed intervention, resulting in the Action Plan for Traveller Participation in Higher Education 2019-2021.

In the summer of 2015, he was approached by a contact in the coin trade. As Williams told me recently, the contact informed him that several pieces of what appeared to be a Viking hoard were being offered to dealers. Some of the coins were Two Emperors, a type so rare that numismatists knew of only two extant examples: one was discovered in 1840, the other in 1950. A Two Emperor coin had never appeared on the open market, and a single one was valued at a hundred thousand dollars. A hoard with a substantial number of rare coins could be worth more than ten million dollars. The fact that individual coins were being offered to dealers suggested that the hoard was in danger of being broken up and vanishing onto the black market.

803,180,"CMO says travel home to spend time with family for Christmas is considered 'non-essential'",https://www.thejournal.ie/dublin-airport-covid-19-testing-5263480-Nov2020/,"Updated Nov 12th 2020, 7:40 PM
THE CHIEF MEDICAL officer has said people should regard travel home for Christmas as non-essential this year.
Dr Tony Holohan said he agreed with comments made early today by Tánaiste Leo Varadkar that it is “too soon” for people to book flights home to Ireland this Christmas.
Dr Holohan said health officials are “concerned about the picture in other countries relative to where we are here”.
“Unfortunately many other countries in Europe are still in a deteriorating situation,” he said, adding that many of the countries people would be travelling back from for Christmas have much higher levels of infection.
“That will be one of the most significant risks for us. If we make the progress that we hope we can continue to make and find ourselves at the beginning of December with a much improved situation, even from where we are at the moment, one of the biggest risks will be the importation of disease through international travel.”
He said the kind of travel that would normally happen at Christmas, “people coming home to spend time with their loved ones”, has to be regarded as non-essential this Christmas.
‘A tough message’
In response to a question in the Dáil earlier from Social Democrats’s Roisin Shortall, the Tánaiste said: “In terms of terms of people booking flights for Christmas to come home. I advise not to do that at the moment.”
Varadkar’s comments came as new regulations regarding incoming travellers are due to come into effect later this month that could limit the number of days people have to restrict their movements subject to a negative Covid-19 test. 
He said the issue of travel changes were discussed with the CMO, noting he wasn’t particularly concerned about international travel at the moment, but it becomes “a greater concern” as Covid-19 figures become lower.
“We’re not in a position at this point to advise people that it’s safe to come home for Christmas. And I know that’s a tough message to hear but that is the case at the moment,” he said.

‘Personal responsibility’
Junior Transport Minister Hildegarde Naughten told the Dáil this morning that people who are travelling home for Christmas to follow the public health advice in effect and to take a PCR test prior to arrival. 
“It is about people taking personal responsibility when they come here and adhering to public health advice,” she said.
She said anyone planning to return home for Christmas, whether they are travelling into the country for essential work or “those now at Christmas who want to come home to visit family, there is a level of personal responsibility, whatever we do here at a national level with the health protocols”.
“They are visiting family, they are visiting their relatives and friends and it is in our own interests that we act responsibly, that they take a PCR test in advance if they are coming from an orange listed country” or a test five days after arrival if they are coming from red listed regions.
However, she said come mid-December, we don’t know “where we are going to be with the virus”.
Her comments come as airports around the country roll out Covid-19 testing capacity. 
Testing at airports
A Covid-19 test centre is due to be up and running at Dublin Airport next week, while new testing facilities become fully operational in Cork and Shannon Airports from today.
Speaking about testing capacity, Naughten said the PCR test is the only test accepted that will allow the waiving of movement restrictions. Other forms of tests are currently undergoing validation.
Drive-thru and walk-thru facilities will be operated by two private providers at Dublin Airport, said the minister.
She said the DAA estimate it will have the volume 150 tests per day, ramped up to 300 at the end of year. Other private capacity around the country allows for 12,000 PCR tests per day.
She said there is “no certainty that capacity will be available to meet all possible requirements of intending passengers who wish to avail of testing”, adding that those that are intending to travel should make an appointment before travelling.
She also urged passengers intending to travel to visit the daa website which contains information on testing as well as the Department of Foreign Affairs website.
In terms of testing at Cork and Shannon airports, two express turnaround testing facilities will provide the pre-departure tests for passengers flying out of the airports in accordance with the EU’s traffic light system.
The rollout of the testing facilities comes as after it was confirmed this week that from midnight 29 November travellers arriving into Ireland from so-called ‘red’ regions in the EU will be allowed to move freely once they pass a PCR Covid-19 test five days following their arrival.
This provision will also be available to arrivals from orange regions who may not have availed of a pre-departure test. 
The move could have a significant impact on people travelling at Christmas as it will limit the number of days people have to restrict their movements for once they arrive at their destination. 
Yesterday, Transport Minister Eamon Ryan said private testing facilities at Dublin Airport, as well as Cork and Shannon airports “will facilitate pre-departure testing for travellers to other countries where the need arises”.
“It will also facilitate post-arrival tests for persons arriving from red regions who may choose to return to the airport five days after arrival to take the test.”  
Ryanair released a statement condemning  Varadkar’s comments against booking flights home for Christmas at this stage.

Ryanair called on the Tánaiste to confirm his support for the EU “traffic light” system, which allows Irish people to return home for Christmas if they have a negative Covid test three days prior to arrival, and similarly allows EU citizens living in Ireland to travel to their home countries during the Christmas season with a negative Covid test result.
The EU’s traffic light system
Ireland has agreed to align with the new EU traffic light plan for international travel, which will see the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control publish a weekly map of the EU using a three-stage colour system to indicate the level of risk in each area.
In an article in the Business Post newspaper last weekend, DAA Chief Executive Dalton Philips said a common system of pre-departure testing across Europe is needed so that all passengers can be tested as Covid free before travel.
“This is what we and others in the industry have been calling for since the summer. We want to set up pre-departure testing facilities at Dublin and Cork airports operated by third party private healthcare experts and we are working to do that. Initially, PCR testing will be offered, but the costs associated with this type of test means that it is not a sustainable long-term scalable option,” he said.
Cabinet agreed this week to issue a planning exemption to the DAA to allow the Dublin Airport to facilitate Covid-19 testing on site.
Philips said “a fast, low-cost option such as an Antigen test, which is already being used in some other countries” is really the only way to get travel reopened. 
“Ireland starts at a significant disadvantage as we have lost the most, we are in a peripheral location that had previously punched above its weight, and we have the added complexity of Brexit.
“If we are slow to move on Antigen testing and maintain a more restrictive attitude to travel than other countries, then Ireland will lose out to our European competitors,” said Philips.
Currently, the PCR test is the gold standard test used in Ireland. Validation of other tests is underway by health authorities.
On 29 November, the new rules kick in for those who wish to travel from or travel into Ireland.
The Department of Foreign Affairs sets government policy on travel.
The department states that if you are considering travelling outside of Ireland, it continues to advise against non-essential travel overseas, other than to countries that are part of the EU ‘traffic lights’ approach, where the advice is to exercise a high degree of caution – this includes Great Britain but not Northern Ireland.

The 63-year-old faces four charges following his arrest near Schull, Co Cork on 25 August, 2019.
Bailey, of Priary, Lisscaha in Schull in west Cork has been charged with and pleaded not guilty to possession of cannabis in his car, possession of cannabis at Bantry garda station, driving while cannabis was in his system, and allowing his car to be used for possession of cannabis.
He was arrested on suspicion of drink driving, having failed a roadside breath test, but he then passed a second test at Bantry garda station.
It’s alleged he failed an oral fluid test and that blood samples taken by a doctor at Bantry garda station later tested positive for the presence of cannabis.
Bantry District Court heard that Bailey had been stopped at a checkpoint in Schull shortly after 8pm on 25 August, 2019.
Judge John King was told that small tin of cannabis was found on Bailey, who allegedly told gardaí that someone had left it for him at his market stall.
The court also heard that Bailey said that the cannabis found on his person was for “personal use” and that a search of his car should not uncover any more of the drug.
However, gardaí allegedly found three other joints in the car after they searched the vehicle. The joints were found in a compartment in the centre dash.
Emmet Boyle, counsel for Bailey, raised a number of issues in relation to the case. These included how gardaí came to uncover the cannabis both on the person of his client and in his car.
The barrister also mentioned other aspects of the garda probe including, including that the arresting garda allegedly retained Bailey’s car keys after his release on the night of his arrest, took the car and parked it at the station overnight before searching it the next day.
The judge agreed to consider written submissions on some of those arguments. The case will return before the West Cork court on 10 December.
Checkpoint set up
Garda Sergeant Kevin Heffernan told the court that he and Garda Corina Finn set up a checkpoint three miles outside Schull on the day of the alleged offence.
He said shortly after 8.15pm, a Kildare-registered cream-coloured Toyota Verso being driven by Bailey approached the checkpoint.
The garda sergeant said that he noted that the driver was not wearing a seatbelt. As the driver approached, he quickly fastened his belt.
When stopped, Bailey produced his driving licence at the checkpoint. The garda sergeant said that he then got a strong smell of alcohol off Bailey’s breath.
Bailey told the garda that he had had a pint with a meal earlier. He also said he was fatigued.
The garda sergeant carried out a roadside breath test, which Bailey failed, before being arrested and taken to Bantry garda station.
His car was parked by the sergeant near the the entrance to a field shortly before 9pm.
Garda Gary Coakley carried out a routine search of Bailey at the station, where a small tin containing cannabis was found.
The journalist passed an evidenzer test for alcohol, but an oral fluid test was conducted shortly after 10pm that night, which tested positive.
‘Someone left it’
A cautioned memo was then taken in which Bailey said of the small tin containing suspected cannabis: “Someone left it at the market stall. They said ‘it’s for you’ and they left it.”
He told Garda Heffernan that it was “green stuff” and, replying to a question about whether he knew what it was, he said “not exactly but it looks like cannabis”.
“I assume it is cannabis and I was in possession of it,” he said.
Bailey said he didn’t know the name of the person who left the tub with him and when asked by the garda sergeant whether additional cannabis would be found in his car he replied: “No, you shouldn’t.”
Garda Gary Coakley said it was standard practice for anyone under arrest to be searched at the station for their protection and the protection of gardaí.
He said that when the tin was found on Bailey, he was informed that a friend had given it to him.
Bailey signed the memo of interview with the garda sergeant shortly after 11pm and gardaí dropped him home.
Car searched
Shortly before midnight, the garda sergeant returned to the checkpoint and unlocked the car and drove it to Schull garda station, where it was parked securely overnight to the rear of the station.
The garda sergeant told the court that he didn’t want to search the vehicle in the dark and that the vehicle was secure behind two electric gates.
The following morning at 8am, he searched the car. He told the court he found in a small compartment in the centre dash two rolled joints and some flakes of cannabis. He also said he uncovered mini cigar of rolled cannabis in the car.

SUPPORT US NOW
The three joints were later retained as evidence. When Bailey called to the garda station for his car the following day, it was put to him that cannabis was found in his car.
Bailey told gardaí that the cannabis was for “personal use”.
Sgt Heffernan told the court that he wasn’t sure whether he had held on to Bailey’s keys at all times, or whether he may have handed them into the member-in-charge before having them returned to him later to facilitate him moving the car.
Counsel for Bailey said the search of his client took place 19 minutes after his arrival at the station.
However, Bailey waited 28 minutes before the 20-minute period of observation for the drink-driving test commenced.
“It was a search of an individual at a Garda station where there is a breach where there was no effort to ensure that Mr Bailey understood the reason for the search, therefore anything uncovered by the search is at issue,” counsel said.
He said gardaí could have asked Bailey to take a test for drug-driving at the roadside.
He said the forming of the decision to carry out the drug-driving test was “retrospective” and based on what was allegedly found on Bailey during the search.
‘Ill-founded’ movement of car
Counsel also said Bailey did not have his car keys and was not in control of the vehicle and the garda sergeant had “no statutory entitlement” to retain the keys and to retain the vehicle. He described the moving of the car to Schull as “ill-founded”.
Inspector Ian O’Callaghan, prosecuting, defended the garda’s procedures.
He said the roadside procedures were “totally correct” and that once cannabis had been found on Bailey in the search, the garda sergeant had correctly formed the opinion that Bailey may have been driving under the influence of a drug.
He said it was “entirely logical” to deduce this and “the sergeant’s opinion was proved correct”, referring to the results of the subsequent analysis.
O’Callaghan said it was “standard practice” that prisoners be searched at a garda station.
He said ” at all times” the keys to Bailey’s car were in garda custody and that “it is the state’s view that all procedures were done correctly”.
The case will return for mention next month.

The information will be used to provide information to parents and guardians in expressing a preference, which is one of the key determinants in deciding a patron.
These three schools are among 47 new schools being established to cater for demographic growth over the four-year period from 2019 to 2022.
Each of the three Dublin schools will have eight classrooms, and will be in the Donaghmede-Howth area; Dublin 2-Dublin 4; and Sallynoggin-Killiney-DLR north.
As a result of a 2019 patronage process to increase access to Irish-language education, the new schools in Donaghmede-Howth and Dublin2-Dublin4 have been designated as Gaelscoileanna.
Language preferences will not be sought from parents in these areas as part of the patronage process; for the Sallynoggin-Killiney school, parents will be asked to state a preference for either Irish or English.
The Department of Education also said that the establishment of the following schools has been deferred from 2021:
Bray-Woodbrook Shanganagh
Clondalkin, D22
Gurranbraher, Cork City
Naas
Kilkenny/City, Western Environs.
Minister Foley said: “It is important that the patronage process for the primary schools which are to open in 2021 is also conducted in as normal a fashion as possible, with patrons being given the opportunity to apply to run the new schools, and parents given the opportunity to express their preference on the choice of patron.
Parental preferences for each patron, from parents/ guardians of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity of provision currently available in these areas, will be key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.

“I am particularly pleased that two of these three new primary schools are designated as Irish-medium primary schools in advance of the [Online Patronage Process System] being run, providing an Irish-medium option for parents in these school planning areas which has not been available to date.”

806,196,"How the Twilight Together photo project captured the mood (and hearts) of the nation",https://www.thejournal.ie/ruth-medjber-interview-5263352-Nov2020/,"IN MARCH OF this year, things changed utterly for people across Ireland. All of a sudden we were all being told to stay indoors. The impact this had on people was immense – but out of the darkness came an enterprising spirit.
One of those who used their fear to spur them on to boost others and capture the mood of the nation was Dublin-based photographer Ruth Medjber.
Her Twilight Together photography series saw her visiting people across the country to photograph them in their homes. The idea struck such a chord that she soon had a book deal – and that book is now nominated for an Irish Book Award, in the Best Irish Published Book category which is sponsored by TheJournal.ie.
‘My job was gone from nearly overnight’
“It really started in early March, because I am normally a music photographer and the music industry was one of the first put on pause,” explained Medjber of where it all began. “I always say I had a bit of a head start, as my job was gone from nearly overnight from March 8. I had a good few weeks of absolute fear and not knowing if there was government support. Feeling uncertainty – especially when you’re self employed and you don’t have any fallback.”
After a few weeks of “absolute loneliness and despair”, Medjber decided she needed a project to get her out of the dark place she was in. “I’m a photographer and it’s in me… it’s the only thing I’ve known, the only thing I do and only thing I’ll ever do,” she said. 
She tried a few different things, but then remembered an idea she’d had back when she studied for her BA in Photography. “I had wanted to photograph people in their windows.” She had shelved the idea back then, as at that age she “didn’t have the capability of getting any project to a level where it would have an emotional response for people”.
But now she knew that things had changed. “Sitting here in my apartment looking out to the courtyard at people sitting in their houses and turning on the big light as the nights got dark, the messages on the telly were all saying stay at home… I was thinking everyone is at home feeling miserable, and for once the whole country is in the same place. The original idea suddenly had relevance.”
Plus, taking the photos through glass meant both she and the participants could stay safe. 
Dena, John and baby
On 23 March she took the first photo, of close friends and their baby. When she arrived, it hit home how much things had changed. “I’d normally let myself in to the kitchen, play with the baby, maybe stay over. This was weird – I went over to their house, my hand went to the door, I couldn’t let myself in. This realisation that this might be for the foreseeable future, it was scary.” 
When she got back into her car after taking the photos, Medjber felt “this overwhelming sense of sadness, because I didn’t want to go home to my empty apartment on my own – I wanted to go and watch telly with my mates.”
But when she looked at the picture, she could feel its emotional impact.
And I thought, if I’m feeling it, maybe others can feel it.
‘Who am I to say no?’
She decided to take 16 portraits, and post them all on Instagram.
When she did post them all, “jaysus, it went mad”, said Medjber. The Irish Times put one on the front of the newspaper the next day, and Medjber woke up to 400 emails from people asking for portraits or saying they were moved by her work.
“I was crying reading it all. And I thought god, if people really want to be a part of this, who am I to say no?”
John and Una
Her project also caught the attention of publishers, and she chose to go with Sandycove, Ireland’s Penguin imprint. Knowing that her editor Fiona Murphy was a fan of her music photography work and understood her style helped in the decision. While Medjber maintained she was a photographer and not a writer, Murphy told her she had faith in her ability to write the book. 
After signing up with Sandycove, Medjber decided to make the project a national one. “It has to be a very fair representation of people in 2020 and all we’ve gone through,” she said. She spent hours travelling around the country while every county was in lockdown, usually travelling alone at midnight to get back to Dublin. 
It was very important for Medjber that the book be as inclusive as possible. “I grew up as a mixed race child in Ireland looking in magazines and in galleries and never seeing representation of mixed-race Irish women,” she said. “I always want to be as inclusive as possible in case there are kids out there looking for themselves in works of art.”
With that in mind, she wanted to make sure the book had a good representation of “every culture, race, religion, ethnicity, every personality type, every profession”.
Zai the Connemara pony
‘Emotional rollercoaster’
Before she visited the homes, she sent an email with a time slot, asking people to be at their window in whatever they wanted to wear. The people could pose however they wanted (some held babies, others their pets). All Medjber asked was people put light sources like lamps near the window, and that the main light in the room was turned on.

“Everybody’s personality comes through,” she said. “Some people did address the severity of the pandemic. Some people are so giddy about seeing a different person in real life they are beaming, having the time of their life in front of the camera.”
The book is “an emotional rollercoaster, like lockdown was for a lot of people”, said Medjber. “I do address and acknowledge the grief, loss and sacrifice people endured during lockdown, and I chat to people who have lost family, friends, career opportunities.” 
“We have to also acknowledge there is hope in all of this,” she added.
It’s not a doom and gloom book. There is a healthy amount of trauma and heartbreak.
Medjber said she “was writing the stories to the pregnancy bumps in the pictures”, addressing her words to those who might not remember what it was like to live through 2020. “I wanted them to actually understand what we had gone through.”
The participants in the project included her own parents. “My parents aren’t cocooning age but I felt this obligation to keep them safe,” said Medjber. 
She said there were lots of heartwarming moments while she travelled around the country – like being offered safe accommodation that was empty, and having socially distanced drinks with people who left a bag of wine, beers and soft drinks for her under a tree.
The Clifden B&B
“I ended up chatting with them for probably about an hour at midnight and looking over Ardmore Bay, which was the most divine day. It was the summer solstice. I thought, ‘the world is on fire and I’m really lucky’. There’s a lot of times where I walked away from people’s houses so overwhelmed and emotional.”
I am quite a level headed person, especially when I’m working, but I was so emotional when I was doing this – I am living through the lockdown as well.
The book was launched on 5 November, and was due to be accompanied by a gallery space at Dean Art Studios on Harcourt St in Dublin, where people could relax in their pod and look at the images. That has had to be put on hold until Level 5 restrictions are lowered, but in the meantime Medjber has been using the space to hold socially-distanced livestreams with bands. 
Reflecting on what the project has done, she says it gave her hope at a strange and difficult time.
“I don’t know if people will ever understand what they did for me during all of this,” said Medjber, who has received lots of thank you cards. “They kept me going – they rescued me from the darkness that was lockdown one.”

Dunnes Stores claims that the sale of food products, from a premises that is next door to one of its outlets, breaches a restrictive covenant contained in lease agreements for units at the Barrow Valley Retail Park, Sleaty Road on the Laois/Carlow border.
The alleged breach has resulted in Dunnes Stores Unlimited Company and Camgill Property Ltd, which is the landlord of the retail park, suing the Dafora Unlmiited Company and Corajio Unlimited Trading as ‘Mr Price Branded Bargains’.
The court heard that earlier this year Dafora acquired the leasehold for a unit in the park, which is next door to the unit operated by Dunnes Stores. Dafora then allowed Corajio trade from the unit under the business name Mr Price Branded Bargains.
The plaintiffs, represented in court by Martin Hayden SC and Roland Rowan Bl, claim that in 2005 and 2007 Dunnes entered, as part of an arrangement to be the park’s anchor tenant, into lease agreements with the retail park’s former owners.
It is claimed that those lease agreements contained a restrictive covenant preventing any other unit in park from being used as a supermarket, grocery discount food outlet or mini-food market.
It is claimed that in breach of the covenant late last month Mr Price commenced selling a variety of food and food products, and groceries from its unit in the Park.
It is alleged that both Dunnes Stores and the retail park’s management company contacted the defendants asking them to desist from selling food products.
They claim the defendants are bound by the terms of the covenant.
The court heard that correspondence the defendants, who had offered to cordon off food products pending a resolution of the row, but argued that Dunnes Stores were not entitled to enforce the covenants.

As a result of the defendants’ alleged failure to desist selling food and groceries from the unit the plaintiffs seek a High Court injunction preventing the defendants from breaching the terms of the lease agreement.
They also seek an order preventing the defendants from selling food, food products, or groceries from the unit.
At the High Court this evening Ms Justice Leonie Reynolds granted the plaintiffs permission, on an ex-parte basis, to serve short notice of the proceedings on the defendant.

Speaking before the Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, Coveney said that the pandemic “left no corner of the globe untouched” and that citizens had been returned from 126 countries. 
“In the early months of the pandemic we focused on coordinating consular assistance to EU citizens, and my department has assisted over 8,000 Irish citizens to return home safely from 126 different countries,” he said. 
Coveney also outlined financial support provided by Ireland to the global fight against Covid-19.
The minister said an EU-wide package has provided “over €35 billion to date” and that “Ireland has allocated over €140 million to the global Covid-19 response so far in 2020″. 
Coveney also outlined his sadness as the death of Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, who died aged 65 of coronavirus complications. 
“I met with Saeb on numerous occasions in Palestine and in Dublin. He devoted well over 30 years of his life to the cause of peace between Palestine and Israel and my sincere condolences to his family and to the Palestinian people,” Coveney said.

The contact tracers, who were hired on temporary contracts and are based in University College Dublin, are set to be paid tomorrow following an investigation by recruitment firm CPL.
The issue was raised in the Dáil by People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd-Barrett yesterday, when he accused the government of responding to the pandemic by using poorly-paid workers.
“You’re trying to fight Covid on the basis of cheap labour and utter gross exploitation, and the latest example of this is just absolutely scandalous,” he told Taoiseach Micheál Martin.
The Taoiseach promised to follow-up the issue, but insisted there was no agenda to not pay workers.

812,226,"Does Johnny Sexton need more support in his role as Ireland captain?",https://www.the42.ie/ireland-captain-the42-rugby-weekly-5264455-Nov2020/,"WHILE THERE HAS been plenty of discussion about Johnny Sexton’s captaincy of Ireland in recent times, there hasn’t been as much focus on the support – or maybe the lack thereof – the out-half is receiving in his role.
35-year-old Sexton succeeded the now-retired Rory Best as Ireland skipper at the start of this year as new head coach Andy Farrell backed his experience. 
Speaking on today’s episode of The42 Rugby Weekly podcast, Bernard Jackman questioned how much leadership is around Sexton in this Ireland team at present.
The former Grenoble and Dragons coach is of the belief that Ireland boss Farrell needs to focus on developing more leaders over the course of the upcoming Autumn Nations Cup and beyond.
“What most successful teams have and what most coaches are hoping to foster is a shared leadership across four or five different players,” said Bernard.
“They don’t need to have a bucketload of experience but they need to have influence on the group.
“I think there is a question mark around the leadership group in this Irish team and that’s not just Johnny. Everyone looks at Johnny but the days of the captain being all-encompassing and running everything are gone.
“Looking back to the World Cup, there was huge talk around the leadership group being disenfranchised with the game plan and training too hard, etc., and Rory Best in his book mentioned that. It caused a bit of controversy.
“But the reality is that the leadership group probably missed an opportunity to affect change or control the performance in the World Cup and Joe is the one who got most of the criticism.
“Since then, in the big games like England away and France away, when things have gone amiss a bit, it seems like Johnny is the only one everyone is looking to. That’s tough on him, particularly the way Ireland play and so much going through him. That’s difficult.

“We’re talking about blooding players and increasing our depth but a massive part of it for Farrell is to find new leaders – four or five players who are going to be first-choice or at least in our matchday 23 who can share that load.

“From what I understand, some of the guys who have been doing that in the past were Rory Best, Johnny, Peter O’Mahony, CJ Stander, Conor Murray, and Keith Earls.
“CJ is not in the squad this week, Earlsie is on the bench, Peter is starting, Conor is on the bench, Rory has retired. I know Garry Ringrose has been earmarked as a leader by Leinster and I would imagine Ireland as well. It’s about having shared responsibility. 
“The interesting one is Eddie Jones. If you look at England when they play, at half-time before the players go into the dressing room, they have a little huddle on the field, they have various leaders in different areas of the game – not just Owen Farrell – speak and give feedback around how it has gone.
“Before Eddie Jones and the coaches speak to the players, they take on board what the leaders in the team feel. If what the coaches feel is completely different, they have that discussion and make sure they understand where the game is going.
“Farrell has to adapt to that and create it. It’s another area where Ireland are just finding their feet. It’s an area that when we get right will help us be more successful.”
Elsewhere on today’s episode of The42 Rugby Weekly, Gavan Casey, Bernard, and Murray Kinsella discussed what James Lowe will bring on his debut against Wales tomorrow, how Jamison Gibson-Park could change things at scrum-half, and Farrell’s seven changes to the Ireland XV.
There was also chat about Seán O’Brien’s assertion that top professional players should be allowed to play for their home clubs, as well as a look ahead to another busy weekend for the four Irish provinces.

In Limerick, there are 161 staff out of work today either due to a positive test or because they are a close contact of a confirmed case. The majority of these staff are from University Hospital Limerick and the HSE is expecting these numbers to increase as all staff are now being tested.
There are also 77 staff unavailable for work today at Naas General Hospital and there is a significant outbreak at Letterkenny Hospital.
At the HSE’s weekly Covid-19 update, CEO Paul Reid said hospitals are “losing a lot of staff on shifts”.
Reid said it has led to a knock-in effect on wards being out of action, with five wards in University Hospital Limerick closed due to staff shortages. He said some hospitals have had to step back or cease elective care and some medical and surgical wards have had to be closed.
“In one case [Naas General] it’s probably back to where we were in April in terms of the hospital just dealing with critical and urgent care,” Reid said.

“The reason I say all of this is to express how fragile it always is and as long as the virus is in our community we are at high risk in our healthcare systems. And it can change very quickly. These hospitals today are under very, very significant pressure.”
He said there is a concern about the numbers and trends in Donegal, which hasn’t seen the same level of decline in transmission as other parts of the country.
“We saw in the early phases in October the pressure point on our three border hospitals – particularly Cavan and Letterkenny – were quite significant and Letterkenny hasn’t really recovered since then, it’s still seeing the impact of the high level of transmission in Donegal,” Reid said.
He confirmed that there is a procedure in place whereby a healthcare worker who is a close contact can return to work after just five days of isolation if all other resourcing options have been exhausted and they are needed in the hospital. This does not include those who have had a positive test or anyone who is symptomatic.

TALKS ON A post-Brexit trade deal look set to go to the wire as Taoiseach Micheál Martin warned that failure to reach an agreement would be “ruinous” for the UK.
Negotiations are expected to continue next week but the European Union believes a deal must be concluded by mid-November in order for it to be ratified by the end of the year, when the current transition arrangements expire.
Downing Street acknowledged that “significant gaps” still remain between the two sides and “time is in short supply”.
Martin said failure to reach a deal would be “very damaging all around”, with Ireland and the UK particularly affected.
Without a deal being struck, trade between the UK and EU will be subject to tariffs set out by the World Trade Organisation.
Speaking to the BBC, the Taoiseach said: “We’ve all had a very significant shock to our economic system because of Covid-19 – the last thing we need now across all of our respective economies is a second major shock.”
Martin also said the UK needs to be “very careful that they do not do anything that could destabilise the politics of Northern Ireland”, and that no deal past the transition period could lead to “tensions that are unnecessary”.
Teams led by the EU’s Michel Barnier and the the UK’s David Frost have been taking place in London this week.
The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “Talks are continuing in London and the negotiators are working hard to bridge the still significant gaps that remain.
Time is in short supply and there are still significant gaps that remain.
Boris Johnson has repeatedly said he is prepared to walk away without a deal – something the government refers to as “Australian terms”.
In response to Martin, the spokesman said: “We have been working hard throughout to get a deal but we’ve always said that it needs to be a deal that fully respects UK sovereignty, and that’s what we’re continuing to pursue.
Right from the outset I don’t think we’ve been seeking anything that the EU hasn’t agreed to with other sovereign countries, and we’re working hard and will continue to work hard, but it is the case that significant gaps remain.

The main stumbling blocks between the UK and EU are thought to include the “level playing field” measures aimed at preventing unfair competition on issues including state subsidies, the ongoing row over fishing rights, and how any UK-EU deal will be governed.
Johnson would “like to get a deal” but the transition period will definitely end on 31 December and “we will be ready to leave either on Australian-style terms or with a free-trade agreement if that can be reached with the EU”.

The Prime Minister is “fully confident we will prosper in all circumstances”.
Stefaan de Rynck, an aide to MBarnier, called for the UK to sign up to “fair competition standards”.
“A whit of courage for signing up to fair competition standards in the mutual interest of EU and UK would be good,” he said.
Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove told MPs: “The UK has already shown a great degree of flexibility in these negotiations, but it is important also that the European Union shows flexibility too.
In particular, there needs to be a full recognition that we are sovereign equals. And any attempt to continue to tie the UK into EU processes or to extend EU jurisdiction by other means would be quite wrong.
He was unable to say how many of the estimated 50,000 customs agents needed to cope with the new trading arrangements were in place.
“It is the case there has been a significant increase in the number of customs agents who are being employed both by companies themselves with in-house capacity and also through intermediaries who have been scaling up their own activities as well,” he said.
Gove was meeting business chiefs to help prepare for the new arrangements which come into effect on January 1, outside the EU’s single market and customs union.","The EU wants a deal by mid-November ahead of the end of the transition period.",10,0,0,21643,"Nov 12th 2020, 7:16 AM"

Geraldine Feeney is a former Fianna Fáil Senator who is being nominated by the government for one of the two vacant positions on political ethics watchdog Sipo. 
Deputy Paul Murphy last week asked Sipo to investigate if Tánaiste Leo Varadkar had breached the code of conduct for office holders when he passed a confidential document to former NAPG president Maitiú Ó Tuathail. 
The now defunct NAGP union came into existence in 2013 but went into liquidation in 2019.
In the Dáil today, Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty TD raised questions over Feeney’s appointment to Sipo and asked whether it be debated in the house. 
Doherty said that one of the two vacancies on Sipo must be filled by a former member of the Oireachtas and that Feeney “meets that criteria”.
“I am sure the Tánaiste is aware – maybe he can tell us whether he is so aware – that Ms Feeney is not just a former Oireachtas member,” Doherty said. 
“She also became a professional lobbyist. There is a question as to whether it is appropriate for a motion to be brought before the house, without debate, asking it to appoint not only a former member of the Oireachtas but also a professional lobbyist to Sipo.”
There is another issue. Ms Geraldine Feeney in her role as a lobbyist only ever lobbied for the NAGP. Her eight returns to the Standards in Public Office Commission show that. The Tánaiste is aware that there is a complaint relating to his conduct on which Sipo will have to adjudicate.
Feeney is listed on the State’s lobbying register as a former lobbyist who had lobbied on behalf of the NAGP in 2017 and 2018, including a meeting with now Taoiseach Micheál Martin in May 2017. 
Feeney had been a member of Seanad Éireann from 2002-2011.

In a tweet this afternoon, Rise TD Murphy said that the government should withdraw the nomination. 
In response to Doherty’s query in the Dáil today, Varadkar said that the nomination of Feeney comes on the advice of Fianna Fáil Minister for Public Michael McGrath.
“The idea of having a former politician on SIPO is to have somebody who has a working understanding of the work we do as politicians. I believe it was Mr. Jim O’Keeffe in the past and it is now proposed to be Ms Geraldine Feeney,” Varadkar said. 
The Tánaiste added that whether or not her nomination would be debated in the Dáil was a matter for the Business Committee.   ","Geraldine Feeney is listed as having lobbied on behalf of the now defunct doctor’s union.",341,0,1,36057,"Nov 12th 2020, 3:50 PM"

Today, tributes were paid to Tony Doherty, a Belfast Health and Social Care Trust worker who died yesterday after contracting Covid-19. 
The BBC reported that two other members of Tony’s family also died recently after contracting Covid-19; the Belfast Telegraph reports that they are Tony’s parents.
In a statement released to TheJournal.ie, Belfast Trust said it was “deeply saddened by the passing of our friend and colleague Tony Doherty”.
Tony was a valued member of our team, but more importantly, he was our friend. Tony was a larger than life figure with a heart of gold who made an instant and lasting impression on everyone he met.
“We all shared many laughs and good times with Tony and we hope these memories can provide some comfort to everyone in the days and weeks ahead.
“Our thoughts and condolences are with Tony’s wife and son, his family and friends at this very sad time. We would ask that the family’s privacy is respected,” the statement said.
SDLP MLA for Upper Bann Dolores Kelly said that the news was ”truly heartbreaking”, and gave her sincere condolences to the family.
The Stormont Executive has been deliberating for four days now on whether or not to continue with circuit-breaker restrictions beyond tomorrow, when they are set to expire.
All parties except the DUP think the measures should continue, as cases have not decreased enough to warrant a lifting of restrictions; the DUP is arguing for some restrictions to be lifted to help businesses operate.
Grief archive
Meanwhile, the Dean of St Anne’s Cathedral in Belfast announced an effort to collate the tales of loss caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.
Among the stories told is that of Bronagh O’Connell’s parents – two former teachers who died three days apart after contracting Covid-19. She said she was denied the opportunity to celebrate their “wonderful” lives during a proper wake.
“He was just put into a coffin and we never saw him again,” O’Connell said.
O’Connell “We had looked after them right to the end. They were like two packages in sealed bags because of Covid and put into their coffins, very, very sad, dreadful – it just felt empty,” she said.
Her mother did not know her husband of 60 years had died last April. She was 86 and he was 89.
“Watching them both being taken out of the house three days apart was horrific,” O’Connell said. 
She is a nurse and has seen many people die but said this was “atrocious”.
She said her father had gone downhill very rapidly after being diagnosed. Her mother followed the same trajectory but suffered more with her breathing.
They had been enormously successful in their professional lives, he rose to the head of the Stranmillis teaching college, she was a school head of art.
It is difficult to put into words the great feeling of loss.
That the whole generation above us in our family is now gone, that is overwhelming.
O’Connell urged people to wear masks and socially distance, wash their hands, the basic health messages.

She welcomed the establishment of the record.
“The people who luckily have not experienced it can get a tiny insight into how it has affected a couple of families,” she said.
Hopefully they will realise how important it is to abide by the restrictions.
Inspired by St Paul’s Cathedral’s ‘Remember Me’ campaign, the website is collating tributes and stories of people all over Northern Ireland.
Belfast Cathedral hopes that the initiative is a continuous legacy of memories retold, which people will be able to treasure for years to come.
Dean of St Anne’s Stephen Forde said it was an opportunity for members of the public to visit Belfast Cathedral as a place to reflect on the challenges, sacrifices and loses that we have all experienced in 2020.
“Through all the restrictions of these past months, it has been so difficult to gather our memories and share our stories of those we have loved and known, but lost,” Forde said.
“’Lives Reflected’ allows us a place to share our memories and celebrate the best in the people we know,” he said.
“’Lives Reflected’ can be a place of healing for our losses, and a promise of togetherness for the future.”

However, the study of teenagers’ habits in 35 European countries showed Irish teenagers were more likely to have taken illicit drugs than their continental counterparts.
The report by the EU Drugs Agency, known as the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), revealed 20% of Irish teenagers had consumed some illegal drug in their lifetime compared to the European average of 17%.
They study also expressed concern over potentially risky cannabis use – which has been taken by 19% of Irish teenagers – and dangers posed by new addictive behaviours such as e-cigarettes.
The report revealed 37% of Irish teenagers already used an e-cigarette at some stage with 15% having had one in the previous month with the highest level of use among non-smokers rather than occasional or regular smokers.
Boys in Ireland are almost twice as likely to use e-cigarettes as girls.
Almost 100,000 students, including 1,940 from the Republic, participated in the latest edition of the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs which also highlighted how gambling for money has become a popular activity with 30% of boys and 19% of girls in Ireland having gambled at least once in the previous year.
One in 10 Irish teenagers regarded their gambling as excessive with 5.7% claiming their gambling was problematic.
The report found alcohol use remains high among adolescents across Europe with 72% in Ireland admitting having used alcohol at some stage with 41% having consumed it in the previous month which were levels slightly below the European average.
However, 16% said they had become intoxicated in the previous month compared to the European average of 13% with the rate slightly higher among girls than boys.
Almost a quarter of Irish teenagers said they had consumed alcohol at the age of 13 or younger with 5.3% claiming they had become intoxicated at the time.
Spirits are the most popular type of alcoholic drink with Irish teenagers followed closely by both beer and cider.
Despite the high levels of alcohol use among young people, the EMCDDA figures show the trend has been downward since a peak in 2003 when 91% of European teenagers had consumed alcohol in their lifetime and 63% had taken in in the previous month.
The study also recorded the lowest level of binge drinking among European teenagers in over a decade – down from 43% in 2007 to 35% last year – although the figure has risen slightly in Ireland in recent years.
A third of Irish teenagers admitted taking at least five drinks on one occasion last year.

The report shows 31% of Irish teenagers have smoked a cigarette in their lifetime compared to the European average of 41%.
Only 14% of Irish students had smoked in the past month in contrast to the European average of 20%.
The study showed 11% of Irish teenagers claimed to have smoked a cigarette before they were 13 with 2.4% stating they had smoked on a daily basis at that age.
The EMCDDA said it was likely that a high proportion of e-cigarette devices contained nicotine and the overall use of nicotine by teenagers could be rising again.
The agency said the issue warranted further investigations because of its potential to have public health consequences.
The EMCDDA said the non-medical use of prescription drugs by teenagers, including tranquilisers, sedatives and painkillers also remained a concern.
Irish teenagers recorded the highest level of use of synthetic cathinones in Europe with 2.5% admitting taking the substance, while they also had one of the highest levels of use of anabolic steroids at 2%.
Ireland also recorded the highest rate of any European country for the perceived availability of cocaine with 22% claiming it was relatively easy to get.
Just over 3% of teenagers in the Republic said they had taken cocaine which made it the most common illicit drug in Ireland after cannabis.","The report revealed 37% of Irish teenagers already used an e-cigarette at some stage.",14,0,1,12902,"Nov 12th 2020, 2:58 PM"

The Northern Ireland Policing Board has today released a report calling on the PSNI to stop using them, which Amnesty Ireland has welcomed.
Amnesty said that it had warned that police using spit-hoods could increase the risk of infection for police officers, as well compromise the health of those suffering breathing difficulties as a result of the virus.
The NI Policing Board and the ICCL have both argued that their use may constitute a form of inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and that they should never be used on children.
Anti-spit hoods are full mesh hoods that are placed through force over the entire head of a person in Garda custody. An Garda Síochána conducted a review of the use of anti-spit hoods, which the ICCL is asking to be published immediately.
Since the start of the pandemic, anti-spit hoods have been used by An Garda Síochána 118 times, with a report by the Policing Authority stating:
They have been used 6 times on children under the age of 18,
16 times on people with obvious signs of a mental health issue
once on a person who appeared to have obvious signs of a learning disability, and
74 times when the person appeared to be intoxicated.
In 100 incidents they were used on males, while the remaining 18 were used on females.

ICCL’s director Liam Herrick said:
The practice of hooding has no place in a modern police force, particularly one that is undergoing significant reform to place human rights at the centre of everything it does.
“Hooding has long been considered a form of inhuman treatment, and when other factors are in place, a form of torture.
While Gardaí must be provided with proper PPE to protect them from the risk of contracting Covid-19, there is no evidence that hooding suspects provides such protection.
The ICCL also called for specific guidelines on the right to protest during the coronavirus pandemic, and called on Gardaí to facilitate peaceful protest and counter protest “in a consistent and fair manner”.","Since the start of the pandemic, anti-spit hoods have been used 118 times by Gardaí.",22,0,0,25860,"Nov 12th 2020, 2:25 PM"

The Council granted permission last month for the house at 15 Usher’s Island, Dublin 8 to be redeveloped into a hostel after its planning section concluded that the proposed change of use to a tourist hostel “will be the best way to secure its long-term conservation”. 
The house at 15 Usher’s Island was once home to members of James Joyce’s family and was the setting of The Dead, Joyce’s best-known short story.
The Council’s decision has now been appealed to An Bord Pleanála by An Taisce, McCourt and Tóibín, the chair of Friends of Joyce Tower Dr Seamus Cannon and architect Charles Hulgraine.
Last year, then-Minister for Culture Josepha Madigan rejected suggestions she should intervene to “save” 15 Usher’s Quay after 100 prominent writers and artists signed a letter calling on her to protect the house. 
Among the signatories of the letter were Anne Enright, Sally Rooney, John Banville, Salman Rushdie, Richard Ford, Edna O’Brien and Ian McEwan, who called for the house to be preserved for literary purposes. 
A number of objections were lodged before the Council granted permission last month. 
The Department of Heritage lodged an objection claiming that the proposal “will undermine, diminish, and devalue a site of universal cultural heritage, importance and part of the UNESCO City of Literature designation”.
However, the planning report recommending permission stated that “the building is capable of being converted into the new use and any harmful extensions or modifications have been removed from the scheme”. 
The Council stated that the plan would allow for the refurbishment, conservation, repair and extension to an existing Protected Structure.

Appealing Dublin City Council’s decision, authors Tóibín and McCourt state that not enough consideration has been given about how the development will impact upon the historic structure. 
“As we approach the centenary of Ulysses in 2022, an event which will offer Dublin a unique opportunity in terms of cultural tourism and promotion, we believe that saving 15 Usher’s Island, this unique piece of our national heritage, is an urgent priority,” they said. 
An Taisce said in its appeal that the height and design of the development “would be seriously injurious to the historic Liffey Quays” and “the provision of a further large hotel in Dublin city centre is very questionable at this time in view of the evaporation of the tourist market”.

Talks aimed at breaking the deadlock over the circuit-break lockdown measures, due to expire at midnight tomorrow, are continuing today after the DUP torpedoed a proposal to extend the measures by two weeks.
Last night, the DUP also vetoed a second proposal by UUP health minister Robin Swann to extend the circuit-break measures by one week.
Dr Michael McBride, the North’s chief medical officer, is reported to have advised politicians early this week that any move to lift the restrictions will cause “excess deaths”.
It emerged today that businesses had been given the wrong deadline for the end of the current circuit-break lockdown.
The Department of Health said it had received “revised legal advice” that regulations forcing the closure of many hospitality businesses expire at midnight on Friday, 24 hours later than the department had previously understood.
But business owners, many of whom expected to reopen from Friday night after four weeks, are expressing frustration over the situation. 
Two Belfast city centre pubs, The Dirty Onion and The National posted “enough is enough. We are opening tomorrow,” on their social media channels. 
The pubs are part of the Beannchor Group, founded by businessman Bill Wolsey, who has been critical of the lockdown restrictions and the impasse in Stormont.
“How can I be sitting here and not knowing if I am able to open tomorrow? How do we get to this state?”
Wolsey added, “Here we are with R below 0.7 and still not able to open. How did those politicians not talk through these scenarios four weeks ago and agree that?”
A further eight new Covid-19-linked deaths were announced in the north yesterday, with 791 new cases of the virus.
While some business leaders have hit out at the possibility of the restrictions being extended, trade unions are less bullish.
In a statement released this afternoon, the Irish Congress of Trade Union’s Northern Ireland Committee expressed concern about the DUP’s decision to veto the one-week extension.

“While we accept that a five-party involuntary coalition is a challenging form of government, we are in extraordinary times within the context of the coronavirus pandemic and therefore our Executive must come to a resolution to these matters immediately,” ICTU said.
“The Chief Medical Officer has sought that the Executive agree to an additional 2 weeks of restrictions. This is perfectly understandable given that today we have more people in hospitals and in ICU than in the Republic of Ireland, despite having a little over one-third of their population.
“What is of particularly serious concern at this point in this crisis is that even when the Minister for Health sought by way of a compromise that the restrictions be continued for 1 week rather than 2, it is reported that the DUP alone rejected this compromise.

Lucy Letby, 30, is alleged to have murdered five baby boys and three baby girls while working at the Countess of Chester Hospital.
She is also accused of the attempted murder of five baby boys and five baby girls, all between June 2015 and June 1016.
The charges took just over two and a half minutes to read out in full when the defendant appeared by video-link at Warrington Magistrates’ Court this morning.
Letby spoke in a strong, clear voice, giving her name, date of birth and address at the start of the brief 10-minute hearing.
The defendant appeared on video sitting in front of a desk, beside her solicitor, partially shaded, in a room at Blacon police station.
Pascale Jones, prosecuting, told the court Letby should be remanded into custody for her own safety.
She said: “The crown will also stress there is substantial grounds to believe for her own protection this defendant should be remanded into custody.”
The eight counts of murder of a victim under one year old are: Cemlyn Bennett, Joseph Johnson, Elsie McNall, Barney Gee, Daisy Parkin, Maddie Freed, Joseph Gelder and Eli Gelder.
The 10 charges of attempted murder are each of potential victims under one year old, one count of which includes Maddie Freed.
District Judge Nicholas Sanders imposed an order restricting the reporting of the names of the surviving babies subject to the attempted murder charges.
Only two members of the press were allowed into the courtroom, with a dozen more in an annex courtroom next door, watching via videolink and more locked out of the court building due to restricted access because of social distancing measures.
Families of the babies were also watching the proceedings via the same link at remote locations.
District Judge Sanders warned there should be no audio or video recordings of the proceedings.
The judge, addressing the defendant, said: “Today’s court hearing is for a number of matters.
“I won’t be taking any plea today, as I’m sure Mr Thomas has discussed with you.

The Independent TD says it is “unreal” the number of Northern registered cars he has seen in his constituency and that “I don’t like it”. 
Fitzpatrick was speaking in the context of the impending expiration of the four-week ‘circuit-breaker’ lockdown in Northern Ireland that has seen pubs and restaurants closed fo 
Speaking to Tánaiste Leo Varadkar, he said he fears this would see an increased amount of cross-border movement. 
“As an ex 27th Battalion soldier myself, I think it’s about time that we started using the army. You see what’s happening in Dundalk we have a barracks in Dundalk where we have 450 soldiers there. Why not deploy them along the border area? 
Louth, Meath and Monaghan have done a fantastic job over the last three or four weeks. Are we just going to flush it down the toilet? I think we have to be realistic. I, for one, want to see united Ireland, my first priority is that the citizens of Ireland are protected. Your government has to protect us.
Fitzpatrick says that cross-border travel is “being abused” and that “the number of northern registered cars you see is unreal”. 
In response, Vardakar said that the government “isn’t giving any consideration” to putting the army on the border. 
“We struggled and fought too hard for too many decades to take all armies off the border and we certainly don’t want to be the jurisdiction that puts uniforms on the border again,” he said. 
Despite this, Varadkar says the question is “a serious one” and that the Covid-19 situation in Northern Ireland is “much worse than here”.
Specifically, he said the incidence of Covid-19 in Northern Ireland was three times higher and the death rate was four times as high.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson has lost his chief spin doctor after a power struggle in Downing Street ended in his resignation.
Lee Cain is leaving his Downing Street role as director of communications after other staff pushed back against his appointment to the role of chief of staff.
Here are some of the key points about the turmoil in Number 10.
What has happened?
Lee Cain is a former Vote Leave staffer and close associate of the controversial Brexit spin doctor Dominic Cummings.
He and Cummings campaigned against Theresa May’s leadership of the Tories, and joined Johnson’s government when he took over in July 2019. 
It emerged last night that he would be quitting as No 10’s director of communications, although he will remain in post until the end of the year. 
He had been offered a promotion to become the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, but a leak of that news prompted a backlash within the Tory ranks – reportedly including Johnson’s fiancée Carrie Symonds – which effectively forced Cain out.
Source: Chris Jackson via PA Images
The chief-of-staff role would have put Cain in charge of the day-to-day operations at Downing Street and made him one of just a handful of people with direct one-to-one access with the Prime Minister.
Disliked by many on the Tory backbenches for his pugnacious style and much-criticised communications strategy during the pandemic, he said yesterday that he would leave his role by the end of the year.
He said he had decided to resign after “careful consideration”, while Johnson thanked him for his “extraordinary service”.
Lee Cain started his career in local news before entering the world of tabloid journalism, where he memorably dressed up as a chicken to torment then Conservative leader David Cameron while at the Daily Mirror.

Does this matter?
In Westminster there are always rumours of rifts and rows and speculation about who is on the way up and who is going down.
But this is all playing out at a time when the UK is in the grip of coronavirus, with the official death toll passing 50,000 and the true figure far higher.

The cunning Mr Cummings: Who is the 'Vote Leave' chief in No 10?
The British public might reasonably expect that at this moment of crisis those involved in running the country should be more focused on that than internal squabbling.
From an Irish perspective, the weakened position of the Vote Leave contingent within Number 10 could make it easier for Johnson to compromise in the post-Brexit trade negotiations – although he has repeatedly insisted he is prepared to walk away without a deal.
Why is Lee Cain controversial?
Along with Dominic Cummings, Cain was one of the key players in the Vote Leave campaign for Brexit who were brought into government by the Prime Minister.
He fought a divisive battle with the press which culminated in a walkout by senior members of the lobby – the reporters covering Westminster – after journalists from some outlets were banned from a briefing on UK-EU trade talks.
The coronavirus crisis has also seen a series of communications missteps, with information affecting the lives of millions of people leaked out or selectively briefed before being formally announced.
What about Cummings?
Cummings was reportedly considering his position after Cain quit, but it appears he will remain in Number 10.
The position of Lord Frost, the Prime Minister’s Europe adviser, was also reported to be uncertain, although he too appears to be staying – but the fact there was speculation about it at a time when post-Brexit trade talks are at crisis point is another alarming sign that all is not well in Downing Street.

And other No 10 figures?
Allegra Stratton.
Source: PA Images
One of the triggers for the turmoil has been the appointment of Allegra Stratton to front the televised news conferences that Number 10 is planning.
A former broadcast journalist, Stratton became Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s communications chief in April.
But she was swiftly poached by the Prime Minister to be the face of Downing Street in planned US-style televised press briefings. Cain reportedly opposed her appointment, and he took it as a blow to his authority.
Long-simmering tensions in No 10 began boiling over; Stratton is thought to have wanted direct access to the Prime Minister rather than reporting to Cain in order to do her job more effectively.
Carrie Symonds, Johnson’s fiancée and a former communications director for the Conservative Party, is described as “an ally” of Stratton. It’s reported that she has clashed with Cain in the past. 
There is no fixed date yet for the start of those briefings, but Johnson hopes they will help improve the Government’s public image.
James Slack, a former Daily Mail journalist who serves as the Prime Minister’s official spokesman and is a member of the permanent Civil Service, is expected to succeed Cain as director of communications.","The Vote Leave staffer is leaving Downing Street at the end of the year.",1,0,0,26109,"Nov 12th 2020, 1:00 PM"

During the 52-year-old man’s trial at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court the jury heard that the man threatened to circulate naked videos of the woman to her family and on the internet if she didn’t withdraw her allegations against him.
The man who cannot be named for legal reasons, was convicted yesterday in the first circuit court trial for offences under the 2018 Domestic Violence Act.
This morning he pleaded guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to a separate charge of intending to pervert the course of justice in the period between March and July 2020.
The charge outlines that he engaged in telephone contact with the woman with the intention of encouraging her to withdraw her statements.
Judge Elma Sheahan remanded him in continuing custody until 12 January next.
Yesterday, following a four week trial, the jury returned guilty verdicts on coercive control, intimidation and multiple assault charges.
The trial heard the man and the woman began a relationship in which he became controlling, answering her mobile phone and isolating her from friends and family.
He threatened to drown her in a river and said he would kill her family and make her watch. He told the woman he was “willing to do time” for her and described how he would kill her father and brother.
The woman described multiple acts of violence, including where the man broke her arm after stamping on her arm and head, dragging her around the floor by her hair, and cutting her face and neck with a pizza slicer.
The jury acquitted him of a charge of assault causing harm relating to an incident where it was alleged he had pushed his former partner down the stairs.
The jury also returned a not guilty verdict on a single count of endangerment which related to an allegation that he had pushed and lifted the woman towards the railings of a bridge, creating a substantial risk of death or harm to her.

During their relationship, the woman said she spent periods in Women’s Aid shelters. After the man broke her arm, hospital staff alerted gardaí and she gave a statement to them.
She testified that he told her he would circulate naked images and videos he had of her on the internet and send them to her family if she didn’t withdraw the allegations against him.
Judge Sheahan continued an order, made during the trial, which prohibits publication of any details which might identity the man or the complainant in either the trial or this separate offence.

Some of those sharing the post appear to be aware that the content is not true, but others are sharing it as if the claims are genuine.
The voice note is being shared by some people who hold anti-mask and anti-lockdown views.
There is no evidence whatsoever to back up the claim. The Defence Forces and the Department of Health have both said that this is not happening. The Defence Forces called it “misinformation” and the DOH said that it has “no scientific basis”.
A spokesperson for the Defence Forces told TheJournal.ie there is “absolutely no truth whatsoever to this Facebook post”.
They said the “only public sources of truth regarding Defence Forces operations and activities” are the organisation’s website and official social media pages.

Other conspiracy theories about people being microchipped
Several conspiracy theories about microchipping have been shared in many countries since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.
A number of theories claim the pandemic is a cover for a plan to implant trackable microchips in people.
Many of the theories incorrectly claim that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is behind the plan. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation previously told BBC News the claim is false.
Gates has been the subject of much misinformation and disinformation about the pandemic and vaccines – claims being made without evidence and denied by Gates.

In June, TheJournal.ie debunked a claim that all British citizens would be microchipped from January 2021.
A letter incorrectly claiming to be from UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson appeared on multiple Facebook pages earlier this year. It stated that a new government initiative would see all UK residents being microchipped from next year onwards.

The letter said the microchipping would allow the government to track the movements of “criminals and terrorists”. The document was confirmed to be “entirely fake” by a spokesperson for the UK Cabinet Office.

There is a lot of false news and scaremongering being spread in Ireland at the moment about coronavirus. Here are some practical ways for you to assess whether the messages that you’re seeing – especially on WhatsApp – are true or not.
STOP, THINK AND CHECK
Look at where it’s coming from. Is it someone you know? Do they have a source for the information (e.g. the HSE website) or are they just saying that the information comes from someone they know? A lot of the false news being spread right now is from people claiming that messages from ‘a friend’ of theirs. Have a look yourself – do a quick Google search and see if the information is being reported elsewhere. 
Secondly, get the whole story, not just a headline. A lot of these messages have got vague information (“all the doctors at this hospital are panicking”) and don’t mention specific details. This is often – but not always a sign – that it may not be accurate. 
Finally, see how you feel after reading it. A lot of these false messages are designed to make people feel panicked. They’re deliberately manipulating your feelings to make you more likely to share it. If you feel panicked after reading something, check it out and see if it really is true.

833,213,"KBC Bank pushed into €41 million loss for 2020 despite positive third quarter figures",https://www.thejournal.ie/kbc-bank-loss-covid-5264038-Nov2020/,"KBC BANK HAS lost €41 million in 2020 so far, despite a pick-up in new lending, mortgage drawdowns and applications in the third quarter of the year.
The loss is mostly driven by the bank’s decision to write down the value of its loan book by €95 million in anticipation of a potential pandemic-linked surge in bad loans, the Belgian-owned bank said in its third-quarter trading update.
The bank also took a €4 million charge as a result of an €18.3 million fine it received from the Central Bank in September over its role in the tracker mortgage scandal.
Like its competitors, KBC’s fortunes improved in the third quarter of the year as large parts of the economy reopened.
Mortgage applications jumped 63% quarter-on-quarter while drawdowns were up 67% from the second quarter of the year.
The bank reported new lending of €297 million on foot of what it described as “a record number of applications”.
Mortgage completions remained down 16% for the first nine months of 2020, at €677 million. This compared favourably with 20% decline observed across the broader Irish market.
“Despite the difficult economic environment, KBC Bank Ireland has continued to deliver a strong performance, particularly around new mortgage lending which saw sustained growth across the quarter,” said Peter Roebben, the bank’s chief executive.
“The volume of new mortgage applications in Q3 were some of the strongest results since the launch of the retail bank and Q3 mortgage applications are up 66% quarter on quarter, reflecting the value and choice we are offering people.”
Tracker mortgages
KBC, the smallest of the five retail banks operating in Ireland, also took a €4m charge in the third quarter due to Central Bank sanctions over its role in the Tracker Mortgage scandal.
A Central Bank investigation found that in 2008 — when tracker mortgages were becoming less profitable for the Belgian-owned bank against the backdrop of the financial crisis — KBC began to withdraw its tracker products.

SUPPORT US NOW
In the process, the Central Bank said that KBC failed to adequately warn customers who were moved from trackers to fixed-rate mortgages that they would be unable to return to their tracker rates.
KBC was also criticised for its “deeply unsatisfactory” engagement with the Central Bank’s investigation.
The regulator described the impact of KBC’s failings on its customers as “devastating and included significant overcharging and the loss of 66 properties” — including 11 family homes. 
Central Bank investigations into Bank of Ireland, AIB and Ulster Bank are yet to be completed. ","However, the Belgian-owned bank saw a ‘record number’ of mortgage applications in the third quarter.",10,0,1,11535,"Nov 12th 2020, 11:25 AM"

Rescue officials said at least three people had been killed — two in Camarines Norte province and another in the town of Tanay in Rizal province.
Typhoon Vamco passed north of Manila between Bulacan and Pampanga provinces, toppling trees and knocking out power. Officials said earlier that nearly 200,000 people had been evacuated, some forcibly, from vulnerable coastal and low-lying areas.
Officials said about 1.9 million households were without power in the Manila region and nearby provinces. Many electricity poles were toppled, power lines were knocked down and transformers were damaged.
President Rodrigo Duterte took a break from an online summit of south-east Asian leaders to fly by helicopter over the affected areas.
“As president I guarantee you that your government will do its best to provide assistance in the form of shelters, relief goods, financial aid and post-disaster counselling. Rest assured, the government will not leave anybody behind. We will get through this crisis,” he said in a televised address.
Rescue teams were deployed to flooded areas in Rizal province, coastguard chief Admiral George Ursabia told DZBB radio.
Marikina city mayor Marcie Teodoro said fierce winds knocked down power lines overnight, leaving many areas without power and internet service.
Heavy rain also flooded many areas and the Marikina River was swollen. Many people in Marikina city were waiting to be rescued from roofs.
“There are many areas that historically don’t get flooded but now they are swamped, like city hall,” he told DZBB radio.

The typhoon had maximum sustained winds of 80mph with stronger gusts this morning, and was heading for the South China Sea.
The government’s main disaster response agency asked the media to relay typhoon alerts in north-eastern areas devastated by an earlier typhoon, Goni, saying the agency’s messages could not be sent by mobile phones due to damaged telecommunications systems.
Goni, one of the strongest typhoons in the world this year, left more than 30 people dead or missing and damaged or destroyed more than 270,000 houses, many in coastal villages. Tens of thousands of people remain displaced.
The Philippines is hit by about 20 typhoons and tropical storms each year.

IN TERMS OF Stephen Kenny’s expectation of work as Irish manager versus the reality, it’s all gone a bit Four Seasons Total Landscaping. 
When he first agreed a deal with the FAI back in an ancient age known as 2018, he couldn’t have imagined it being like this: the echoing, empty grounds; the hermetic squad bubble; and the plan-shredding chaos of Covid-19.
He spoke yesterday of some of other plans gone awry, which included bringing in musicians and visiting Dublin museums to better foster an Irish identity within the squad. 
The latest abnormality is a friendly with England at an empty Wembley stadium, a ground at which Ireland have never won. 
Ireland have beaten England twice in history, with the first at Goodison Park in 1949, when Ireland became the first foreign international side to beat England at home, an achievement often wrongly attributed to Hungary.  
The other win over England came in Stuttgart, when…well, you can finish that one. 
Darren Randolph is the only member of the Irish squad alive for that game, while Stephen Kenny watched it the day before an English paper of his Leaving Cert. (Doing the Leaving during Euro ‘88 being the kind of poor timing that has followed Kenny to the international job.) 
Winning at Wembley for the first time is a source of motivation for Ireland tonight, but there are earthier concerns too. World Cup seeding is one: Ireland are currently ranked among the top 20 sides in Europe and on course to be second seeds in next month’s qualifier draw.
The gap to the third seeds is as slender as cigarette paper, however, so Ireland need to win games over this window to give themselves the best possible chance of clinging to the edges of pot two.  
This game might also reckon with the bottom line of the Kenny reign so far. Five games in, Ireland are showing more conviction in possession and are fashioning better goal scoring chances, but have yet to take them. 
Ireland need some goals and at least one win in this window to mint the progress made thus far. That Ireland are voluntarily facing England within that context has raised eyebrows in some quarters, but Kenny isn’t outwardly concerned. 
Kenny seems less outwardly concerned by that need tonight, pointing out Ireland could have picked an easier friendly opponent than England tonight. 
Members of the Irish squad meet Katie Taylor with whom they are sharing a London hotel this week.

Tonight’s task is further complicated, as ever, by Covid and injury. Callum Robinson has tested positive for the virus and has left the squad, while Aaron Connolly has been ruled out with a hamstring strain picked up in training. 
Kenny sought the silver lining of their absences yesterday, stressing it offers a chance to Adam Idah, Ronan Curtis and James Collins. Curtis impressed off the bench in Finland, while this is Collins first inclusion under Kenny thanks to a decent run of goalscoring form with Luton Town. 
Ireland have been weakened defensively too, with Enda Stevens missing out with a knee injury. The infernal Doherty/Coleman discourse will likely be stilled by Doherty switching to left-back, though Kenny floated the possibility both could play down the right in a more traditional 4-2-3-1, a formation Ireland played for much of the last window.

Elsewhere, Kenny made a point of talking up Liverpool goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher ahead of the game, so he may be in line for an appearance.
England, meanwhile, arrive into the game shadowed by our old friend, Administrative Chaos.
Chairman Greg Clarke resigned on Tuesday, having managed to offend just about everybody at a Parliamentary hearing by using a series of outdated, hurtful tropes.
Clarke referred to black footballers as “coloured”, said the FA’s IT Department employed more South Asians than Afro-Caribbeans because of differing “career interests”, implied being gay is a lifestyle choice and relayed an anecdote in which a coach supposedly told him schoolgirls don’t like playing as ‘keepers as they “just don’t like having the ball kicked hard at them.” 
He resigned before supper. 
Gareth Southgate told the media Clarke’s words were unacceptable, and he stressed the same message to his players. 
Like Kenny, Southgate stepped up from the U21s to take the senior gig, albeit in unforeseen circumstances after controversy engulfed Sam Allardyce and a pint of wine. 
Southgate is amid a slightly tricky run of form at the moment. A 2-1 Wembley win over Belgium has been leavened by defeat at home to Denmark, a dire draw in Copenhagen and an unconvincing win away to Iceland.

His team are struggling for the rhythm that comes with a definitive identity and style of play, which served them so well at the 2018 World Cup. 
That they do look slightly out of joint is perhaps a consequence of Southgate’s selection policy over the last three months, which has seen him call up 10 uncapped players across three squads. 
There are, of course, a few familiar faces in the England squad, including the 2018 FAI Young Player of the Year Declan Rice and the 2014 FAI U21 Player of the Year, Jack Grealish. Michael Keane, who played for Ireland up to U19 level, is also in the squad. 
They are the most notable ‘What Ifs’ in the English squad, though Reece James, Harry Kane, and Bellingham were technically eligible to declare for Ireland once upon a time. 
Kenny says he won’t dwell on the players unavailable to him, and he can’t afford to as he prepares to meet the strongest opposition of his brief but anarchic international management career thus far.

The 15-year-old’s body was discovered unclothed last year after a massive hunt through the rainforest.
Authorities insist there was no foul play but her parents believe she was abducted from the resort where they were staying near Kuala Lumpur, saying the teen would not have wandered off alone.
Testifying at the inquest into her death, Sebastien Quoirin said he “heard some muffled noise coming from the chalet” late at night on the day the London-based family arrived.
“I could feel it was close… I cannot describe the nature of the noise,” he said, speaking via video-link as he could not attend the hearing in person due to the coronavirus.
The 48-year-old Frenchman did not get up to investigate, however, saying he was in a “state of semi-consciousness”. The teen’s mother, Meabh Quoirin, made similar claims in her testimony Wednesday.
They discovered their daughter was missing the next morning. A 10-day hunt involving hundreds of rescuers followed, before the schoolgirl’s body was found close to the resort.
A window latch on the chalet was broken, but the teen’s father did not believe she could have climbed out alone as she struggled with mobility and balance.

'No indication' of abduction, police chief tells inquest into the death of teenager Nora Quoirin
“She has no survival instincts. I could not understand how she could have got out of the chalet and ventured out of the resort herself,” he said.
He said the teen’s feet were uninjured when her body was discovered, which would be unusual if she spent days wandering in the jungle, and believes she could have been kidnapped and then dumped.
“The abductors could have realised she was a liability following the extensive police search and widespread media attention,” he said.
The family have criticised authorities for responding slowly after the teen’s disappearance but police say they conducted a thorough probe and there is no indication of kidnapping.
An autopsy found the teen had probably starved and died of internal bleeding – but her family pushed for the inquest, which is expected to continue into December.

841,189,"Hong Kong legislature opens ahead of planned mass resignation of pro-democracy bloc",https://www.thejournal.ie/hong-kong-resignation-pro-democracy-5263935-Nov2020/,"HONG KONG’S LEGISLATURE opened today ahead of the planned mass resignation of its pro-democracy bloc, one day after the government ousted four of its members.
One of the pro-democracy lawmakers, Lam Cheuk-ting, unfurled a banner from a balcony of the legislative council building saying the city’s leader Carrie Lam had brought disaster to Hong Kong and its people.
The group had said they would hand in resignation letters today, but it was not immediately clear when they would do it or even what the proper procedure was.
One said the removal of their four colleagues could sound the “death knell” for democracy in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.
The resignation of the 15 remaining pro-democracy lawmakers would ratchet up tensions over the future of Hong Kong, a former British colony, regional financial hub and bastion of Western-style civil liberties where China’s government has increasingly tightened its control.
A new national security law imposed by Beijing this year has alarmed the international community.
The mass departure would also leave Hong Kong’s legislature with only pro-Beijing lawmakers, who already make up a majority but would be able to pass bills favoured by Beijing without much opposition.
The lawmakers announced their decision hours after the Hong Kong government said it was disqualifying the four legislators — Alvin Yeung, Dennis Kwok, Kwok Ka-ki and Kenneth Leung.
The ousters came after China’s National People’s Congress Standing Committee passed a resolution this week saying that any lawmaker who supports Hong Kong’s independence, refuses to acknowledge China’s sovereignty over the city, threatens national security, or asks external forces to interfere in the city’s affairs should be disqualified.
“This is an actual act by Beijing … to sound the death knell of Hong Kong’s democracy fight because they would think that, from now on, anyone they found to be politically incorrect or unpatriotic or are simply not likable to look at, they could just oust you using any means,” lawmaker Claudia Mo told reporters.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam defended their removal, saying legislators must act properly and that the city needs a body comprised of patriots.
“We cannot allow members of the Legislative Council who have been judged in accordance with the law to be unable to fulfill the requirements and prerequisites for serving on the Legislative Council to continue to operate in the Legislative Council,” Ms Lam said.
Lam said that the legislature would not become a rubber-stamp body, and that diverse opinions are welcome.
The US, UK and Australia denounced the move.
US President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, said it leaves “no doubt that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has flagrantly violated its international commitments under the Sino-British Joint Declaration and its promises to the people of Hong Kong … ‘One Country, Two Systems’ is now merely a fig leaf covering for the CCP’s expanding one party dictatorship in Hong Kong.”
In recent months, Beijing has increasingly clamped down on Hong Kong, despite promising when it took control in 1997 to leave the territory’s more open legal and economic systems intact for 50 years until 2047.
Beijing imposed a national security law in June that some have labelled draconian after anti-government protests rocked the city for months last year, and it has used it to crack down on opposition voices.
In response, the US levelled sanctions on several officials, including Lam.

Several Western countries have suspended their extradition treaties with the territory, and Australia and Britain have offered Hong Kongers easier paths to settle in those countries.
Beijing has lashed out at what it calls gross foreign interference in Chinese politics.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said yesterday that the disqualification was necessary to maintain rule of law and constitutional order in Hong Kong.
“We firmly support the (Hong Kong) government in performing its duties in accordance with the Standing Committee’s decision,” he said.
Earlier in the year, the four lawmakers were barred from seeking reelection in a vote originally scheduled for September — but remained in their posts.
They were disqualified over their calls for foreign governments to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and Beijing.
The government eventually postponed the planned September election by a year, citing the coronavirus, but the pro-democracy camp criticised the move as an attempt to block them from taking a majority of seats in the Legislature — which was a possibility in the coming election.","One pro-democracy lawmaker said the removal of their colleagues could sound the “death knell” for Hong Kong’s democracy.",2,0,0,7628,"Nov 12th 2020, 8:05 AM"

Klain will lead a White House likely to be consumed by the response to the coronavirus pandemic, which continues to spread unchecked across the nation, and he will face the challenge of working with a divided Congress that could include a Republican-led Senate.
Klain served as the coordinator to the Ebola response during the 2014 outbreak.
In a statement last night, Biden suggested he chose Klain for the position because his longtime experience in Washington had prepared him for such challenges.
“His deep, varied experience and capacity to work with people all across the political spectrum is precisely what I need in a White House chief of staff as we confront this moment of crisis and bring our country together again,” Biden said.
Klain served as chief of staff for Biden during Barack Obama’s first term, was chief of staff to Vice President Al Gore in the mid-1990s and was a key adviser on Biden’s presidential campaign, guiding his debate preparations and coronavirus response.
He has known and worked with Biden since the Democrat’s 1987 presidential campaign.
The choice of Klain underscores the effort Biden’s incoming administration will place on the coronavirus response from day one.

Klain was the Ebola response coordinator during the 2014 outbreak and played a central role in drafting and implementing Obama’s administration’s economic recovery plan in 2009.
It is also likely to assuage some concerns among progressives who had been gearing up for a fight over one of the first and biggest staff picks Biden will make as he builds out his White House team.
The chief of staff is typically a gatekeeper for the president, crafts political and legislative strategy and often serves as a liaison to Capitol Hill in legislative negotiations.
Progressives had expressed concerns that Biden would pick one of his other former chiefs of staff: Steve Richetti, who faces scepticism for his work as a lobbyist, or Bruce Reed, who is seen as too much of a moderate to embrace reforms pushed by the party’s base.
But progressives see Klain as open to working with them on top priorities like climate change and health care.

Standing in front of a double-decker bus, he then set the liquid on fire.
Witnesses can be heard shouting as a police car pulls up and officers run out to tackle the man at a bus stop metres away.
Another police officer appears to use a fire extinguisher to put out the flames on the road.

Speaking on behalf of Mazlum, who speaks limited English, his wife Serife Mazlum, 32, told the PA news agency: “He literally just walked out (of his shop) to just call me and see if everything’s OK at home.

The Council is turning its Christmas lights on in every town and village at 7pm today. It’s also encouraging people to join in by lighting up a window in their home or business “in a moment of hope and solidarity”.
This is part of the Council’s ‘A Real Cork Christmas’ initiative, which was announced on 2 November and is designed to “bolster” communities and businesses in Co Cork.
The Council said that it aimed to promote “the vibrant range of gifts and products on sale locally”, ensure Christmas is still celebrated in a “safe and meaningful way”; and create a sense of solidarity and hope among the people of Cork, despite the challenges.
Tens of millions of euro are spent in Cork in the run up to Christmas, the Council says, but with limits on shops, restaurants, and other business owners due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Council is urging Cork county’s 300,000 citizens to support local. 
Other initiatives include:
Students in fourth class across Co Cork are being asked to design a Christmas postcard to represent what ‘A Real Cork Christmas’ means to them. 
To promote well-being and mental health, the Council is launching ‘Slí Na Croí Am Nollaig’, where red and white ribbons will be added to community walkways to symbolise community solidarity
The Council is establishing a virtual marketplace, where businesses are invited to post their details and how potential customers can contact them. Businesses can apply to join the marketplace here.

Source: EPA
THERE ARE 35 towns and villages in Ireland where raw sewage is released into the environment every day.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is critical of Irish Water in its analysis of urban waste water treatment last year, and said that treatment at 19 of Ireland’s 172 large towns and cities, including Dublin and Cork, failed to meet standards set to prevent pollution. 
Irish Water has admitted progress has been “slower than anticipated” but said that “real and tangible progress” is also being made.
Our colleagues at Noteworthy want to find out if swimming off Ireland’s coast is under threat from wastewater pollution. Support this project here.
In a report released this morning, the EPA said that “uncertainty in delays in delivering critical wastewater infrastructure is undermining confidence and prolonging the risk to the public”. 
It identifies 113 priority areas where improvements are needed to prevent water pollution, eliminate discharges of raw sewage, meet EU treatment standards and protect bathing waters and freshwater pearl mussels.
Some improvements in performance were in evidence last year, the EPA said, including the removal of the raw sewage discharges from one town and improvements in treatment at nine towns and villages where waste water was the main issue.
However, significant problems remained according to the EPA.
It said: “The final deadline for all large urban areas to meet EU treatment standards was 2005 and it is unacceptable that treatment at 19 areas failed to meet the standards in 2019.
“These include the greater Dublin area, served by Ringsend treatment plant, which is of significant concern because it produces almost half (44%) of Ireland’s waste water.”

The EPA said that the Ringsend plant repeatedly failed to meet standards last year because it does not have the capacity to effectively treat all the sewage it receives. 
However, it said that Irish Water is upgrading the plant and advises it will be completed in 2025.

Three beaches where waste water contributed to poor quality bathing waters were also identified, in Clifden and Ballyloughane in Galway and Merrion Strand in Dublin. 
Dr Tom Ryan, director of the EPA’s office of environmental enforcement, said: “Raw sewage discharges pose an unacceptable risk to the environment and public health. Two years ago, Irish Water advised it would provide necessary treatment infrastructure by the end of 2021 for 30 of the 35 areas discharging raw sewage. It has now revised this down to just two areas, resulting in significant delays in bringing projects to completion.
Plans are only effective if implemented, and the inherent uncertainty of these plans is a serious cause of concern for the EPA. Irish Water must remedy the underlying causes for the delays in delivering this critical infrastructure to ensure that raw sewage discharges are eliminated.
In a statement, Irish Water’s managing director Niall Gleeson said: “We are making real and tangible progress working with local communities to deliver critical infrastructure which has suffered from years of historic underinvestment.
“Since 2014 we have made considerable progress in removing 130 areas from the priority area list, and have plans for the majority of the remaining 113 areas. We are always striving to prioritise the best possible service improvements, while maximising value-for-money with funding available.
Progress across a portfolio of projects has been slower than anticipated as we deal with an unprecedented level of statutory and planning issues. 
Delivering new infrastructure where it never existed presents a range of challenges - from competing investment priorities, to community support, to planning consents in addition to land acquisition which can take to up to two years for just one project. Indeed, there is a concerning upward trend in the number of acquisitions subject to CPO orders which remains a last resort.
Gleeson added that it expects to start work next year in 12 more communities where raw sewage is being discharged with the work of  most of the remaining areas to begin in 2022 or 2023.","The Environmental Protection Agency is sharply critical of Irish Water in its latest report.",34,0,1,52869,"Nov 12th 2020, 6:15 AM"
847,194,"HSE to begin 'enhanced contact tracing' to pinpoint infection hotspots after delay caused by surge in cases",https://www.thejournal.ie/hse-to-undertake-enhanced-contact-tracing-14-days-before-symptoms-by-december-5262855-Nov2020/,"THE HSE HAS revealed plans to begin investigating where people are being infected with Covid-19 as part of a new “retrospective contact tracing” policy. 
The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) endorsed a proposal to conduct enhanced tracing in September. The plan was delayed, however, due to a spike in cases in October and delays with Ireland’s Testing & Tracing programme. 
In a statement to TheJournal.ie, the HSE said “enhanced contact tracing” for routine cases of Covid-19 will commence in early December.  
The aim is to gather additional information on Covid-19 cases labelled as ‘community transmission’ – where the source of the infection is unknown – and will involve a series of questions in order to build a more accurate picture of where people are contracting the virus. 
The HSE has said that it is important to start enhanced contact tracing while the incidence of disease is low.
The aim is that it will ensure Ireland’s Testing & Tracing system is prepared to identify early infections. This could lead to quicker local interventions after Level 5 restrictions are lifted. 
Up until now contact tracing teams have asked people about their close contacts and movements up to 48 hours before they develop symptoms rather than pinpointing where they could have been infected. 
Enhanced tracing has previously been carried out by Public Health teams for cases in complex settings only such as nursing homes, Direct Provision centres and meat processing plants. 
Enhanced tracing will now be carried out by contact tracers throughout Ireland for otherwise routine cases of community transmission, which has spiked since cases began to rise in September. 
Following NPHET’s recommendation in late September that bars and restaurants in Dublin stop serving customers indoors, there were calls for officials to provide concrete evidence that transmission had been linked to these settings.
At the time, NPHET’s epidemiological modelling advisory group chair Professor Philip Nolan said Public Health teams’ priority was tracking where the virus was spreading and preventing onward transmission but added that retrospective tracing would be important in the future.  
“We would like to go back and find out where people are getting the virus, but we don’t have the time or resources to pursue this academic exercise,” he said on 18 September. 
It is estimated that in the fortnight up to 10 November, 33% of cases are linked with community or possible community transmission – where the source of infection is not known. 
A spokesperson for the HSE said confirmed cases will be asked to describe their activities and contacts for up to 14 days prior to symptom onset. 
“This facilitates the identification of possible sources of their infection and identification of other contacts that may require monitoring,” they said. 
Under the new system, when confirmed cases are first contacted by tracers they will be asked “key questions” regarding visits to healthcare settings, visits to friends or relatives as well as questions around restaurants, pubs and cinemas in order to pinpoint if a particular setting is high-risk and requires intervention by Public Health teams.

People will also be asked questions about visits to special events, including weddings and christenings, up to 14 days prior to symptoms developing.
In addition, contact tracers will also pinpoint movements around sports and exercise, public transport, religious services and visits to hairdressers and nail bars. 
Data will be gathered and analysed to identify key settings where exposure to Covid-19 most likely occurred and potential hot spots of infection. 
In a letter to the Government in September, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Ronan Glynn said: “Such an approach will allow the environments and activities associated with the greatest levels of transmission be more accurately and quickly identified.”
In its guidelines, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says contact tracing should “rapidly identify secondary cases that may arise after transmission from the primary known cases in order to intervene and interrupt further onward transmission”.
Modelling studies suggest that adding an element of retrospective contact tracing to regular contact tracing may reduce the effective reproduction number, the HSE spokesperson said. 
Ireland’s R-number is currently estimated at between 0.7 and 0.9 having fallen from 1 the previous week.

848,209,"Boris Johnson's communications chief resigns in Downing Street power struggle",https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-communications-director-quits-5263843-Nov2020/,"BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson’s communications director Lee Cain has dramatically resigned from his role amid signs of a bitter Downing Street power struggle.
In a statement, the former journalist said that after “careful consideration” he had decided to leave No 10 at the end of the year.
The surprise move comes less than 24 hours after it was reported that he was to be promoted to the key position of the prime minister’s chief of staff.
Cain was a close ally of Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s chief adviser, having worked with him on the Brexit campaign.
The appointment was seen as consolidating the former Vote Leave team’s grip at the top of Downing Street.
However it provoked an immediate backlash with Johnson’s fiancee Carrie Symonds reportedly opposed to the move.
In a statement announcing his resignation, Cain said he was leaving despite having been offered the chief of staff post.
“After careful consideration I have this evening resigned as No 10 director of communications and will leave the post at the end of the year,” he said.
It has been a privilege to work as an adviser for Mr Johnson for the last three years – being part of a team that helped him win the Tory leadership contest, secure the largest Conservative majority for three decades – and it was an honour to be asked to serve as the Prime Minister’s chief of staff.
“I would like to thank all the team at No 10 – including the many unsung and incredibly talented civil servants – for their hard work and support during the last 18 months.
“And most of all I would like to thank the Prime Minister for his loyalty and leadership.”

In response, Johnson paid tribute to Cain’s “extraordinary service” to the government over the past four years.
“He has been a true ally and friend and I am very glad that he will remain director of communications until the new year and to help restructure the operation,” the prime minister said.
He will be much missed.
After the 2016 Brexit referendum, Cain joined Johnson as a special adviser when he was made foreign secretary by Theresa May.
He stuck with Johnson when he quit two years later over May’s proposed Brexit deal and worked on his campaign to succeed her as Tory leader.
There was speculation Cain could be followed out of No 10 by Cummings.
As Johnson’s top adviser – who was brought in when he became Prime Minister last year – Cummings has been seen as the pivotal figure in Downing Street.
However his abrasive manner and open contempt for MPs has earned him many enemies in Whitehall.

Trouble brewing
Cain’s departure comes amid growing unhappiness among Conservative MPs at the performance of No 10 and its handling of the coronavirus outbreak.
Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, a senior member of the influential Tory backbench 1922 Committee, said Johnson needed someone who could act as a link with the party in parliament.
“I think it is essential for the Prime Minister to have a chief of staff – somebody we can get hold of if we really need to,” he told the PA news agency.
Labour Party leader Keir Starmer said that on the day official government figures showed coronavirus deaths had passed 50,000, Downing Street should be focusing on getting the disease under control and not internal power struggles.
“I think on the day when we’ve reached this grim milestone in relation to the number of people who have died from Covid-19, the idea of power struggles going on behind the doors of No 10 is not what the public want to hear,” Starmer said.
They want to know that everybody in No 10, everybody in Government, is focusing on getting the virus under control.

Trump, who honoured US veterans in a ceremony that was held during a steady rain, has spent the last few days at the White House tweeting baseless claims of voter fraud after his election loss.
He has made no public comments since president-elect Joe Biden surpassed the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency on Saturday.
Although his official schedule has been devoid of public events, Trump has made several moves – sacking defence secretary Mark Esper and installing three staunch loyalists in top defence jobs.
Trump’s pick to serve as acting defence secretary, Christopher Miller, was among the Pentagon brass that joined the president for the solemn Veterans Day ceremony.
Meanwhile, his legal team has filed a barrage of lawsuits alleging voting fraud in the battleground states that went for Biden.
The president’s resistance to acknowledging the outcome of the race has stalled the transition process as the head of the General Services Administration, a Trump appointee, has held off on certifying Biden as the winner of the election.
The certification – known as ascertainment – frees up money for the transition and clears the way for Biden’s team to begin putting in place the transition process at agencies.
“I just think it’s an embarrassment, quite frankly,” Biden said yesterday of Trump’s refusal to acknowledge the election results.

THE CORK FOOTBALL management are waiting for permission from AFL side Collingwood as to whether Mark Keane will be available for the Munster football final on Sunday week.
Keane was the goalscoring hero as they dumped out Kerry at the semi-final stage on Sunday.
The game marked the 20-year-old’s first senior outing for Cork after Collingwood had given him the green light to link up with the squad when he returned home to Ireland after the 2020 AFL season had drawn to a close.
Manager Ronan McCarthy confirmed tonight that they made the request yesterday and will now wait to see if they can call upon Keane for the game against Tipperary in Páirc Uí Chaoimh.
Collingwood’s involvement in the AFL Finals Series ended on 10 October, with this season delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The return to training plan for the 2021 season in the AFL indicates that first to fourth year players are set to resume training for a two week block from 7 December.
“We only requested it yesterday so we’ll give it a few days but I think it’s important that he’s their player and it’s their call,” stated McCarthy.
“We are delighted with the support they have given us and given him and at some point, whenever that will be, it may become an issue and that it their right and entitlement.
“So we’ll keep up what we did the last time. As I said last week the right way to do it is ask, to formally ask for permission to use him and if not, we understand that as well because they also have to think of themselves.
“As I understand it, he is not due back til January. But just to clarify if someone tells me differently you know, that’s where it is at at the moment. We sought permission for the game and we are planning game by game.
“Mark last year he was back at one stage and he came in with us just training, this was around pre-season time and he was in with us for a couple of weeks. What you find is he’s very interested in Cork football and he’s also wondering how we are getting on and letting us know he was coming home.

“He was eager to play and come in and help us out and then from our point of view and from the county board’s point of view you don’t want a situation where a professional player is in with us and his club isn’t aware of it and haven’t given permission. Once he said he wanted to come on we said we’d go back to the club and let’s get it sorted and done in writing and everything else.”
McCarthy is pleased with the announcement that the game on 22 November will be on in Páirc Uí Chaoimh.
“It’s great, you look for any advantage that you can get and certainly the fact that we were there last Sunday and are there again helps. Look we had a very poor record at home which I have acknowledged previously over the last couple of years and we have put a little run together between league matches and the Kerry game last Sunday we have been consistent at home and we need to try and keep that going.”

THE NORTHERN IRELAND Executive has been adjourned for the night without reaching an agreement on new coronavirus restrictions. 
NI’s four-week circuit-break lockdown ends at midnight tomorrow, at which point regulations that have forced the closure of much of the hospitality sector will fall away.
Divisions at the head of the Stormont executive have been laid bare as ministers struggle to agree on the restrictions. 
The DUP has already vetoed a proposal from health minister Robin Swann to extend the current circuit-break by two weeks, despite the other four executive parties backing the move.
During a third executive meeting in three days on Wednesday, it is understood that Swann suggested a one-week extension of the measures, which have forced much of the hospitality sector to close.
It is understood the DUP’s initial reaction to the proposal was not positive.
Ministers were due to resume talks today on proposals to partially reopen the hospitality sector after late night meetings on Monday and yesterday broke up without agreement.
The administration is facing mounting criticism for failing to tell businesses whether they will be able to reopen on Friday.
During yesterday’s executive meeting, Alliance Party justice minister Naomi Long was particularly critical of the deployment of the cross-community vote – a mechanism designed to protect minority rights in a post-conflict society – to torpedo health regulations.
After Swann’s paper was voted down, ministers turned to debating the alternative proposals tabled by DUP economy minister Diane Dodds.

A majority of Stormont ministers also voted against proposals from Economy Minister Diane Dodds that would have led to a partial reopening of the hospitality sector in Northern Ireland.
Other plans
It is understood Justice Minister Naomi Long is developing a paper that would fuse Robin Swann’s one-week extension proposal with Diane Dodds’ plans for partially reopening the hospitality sector.
Under the proposal, the circuit break would continue for a further week before the introduction of measures that would allow cafes and coffee shops to reopen and close contact services to resume.
Ministers will resume discussions in the morning on the proposals tabled by Naomi Long.
PA understands that a paper tabled by Robin Swann to the executive this afternoon warned ministers that failure to extend the circuit break by two weeks would “significantly increase” the likelihood of a pre-Christmas intervention in Northern Ireland.

The paper makes clear that even a two-week extension may not be enough to avoid the need for new measures being imposed ahead of the festive period.
The paper, which proposed a one-week extension to give ministers more time to develop an agreed approach, warns that hospitals in Northern Ireland are all currently operating “at, close to, or above full capacity”.
It highlighted that if hospitals are overwhelmed with Covid-19 cases then capacity to deliver other services will be “adversely impacted”, leading to increased deaths from other causes.
In the document, Swann also expressed doubt about whether alternative proposals tabled by Economy Minister Diane Dodds could be translated into regulations in time for the lapsing of the current circuit break on Thursday.","Northern Ireland’s lockdown is due to end at midnight tomorrow.",10,0,1,42263,"Nov 11th 2020, 7:10 AM"

Cartoon comedies
The Simpsons and South Park had a major influence on popular culture in the US and beyond – let’s take a look at how. 
(Vice, approximately 16 minutes reading time)
Though not the longest-running on this list, South Park has somehow remained consistent over its two decades on the air, adapting its humor and philosophy with the times. A profane show from day one, South Park was the first-ever regular program dubbed TV-MA in the US and blazed a trail for the future of television by normalizing unbleeped swearing on cable. Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone’s “both sides suck” approach to issues helped to create a generation of “South Park Republicans” who (often incorrectly) assumed Parker and Stone to be on their team.

856,196,"These stunning colourised photos give a new look at Ireland's past",https://www.thejournal.ie/old-ireland-in-colour-book-interview-5262943-Nov2020/,"LOOKING AT IMAGES of times past gives an insight into history – we can see where we came from, and marvel at how different life was. The images can also make concrete the idea that certain people or things existed.
Although early colour photography emerged in 1907 (photography itself was invented in the late 1830s), it wasn’t widely used. Even up until the relatively recent past, black and white photography was the favoured choice for newspapers, given that this type of film is easier and quicker to develop, and works well under low light conditions. 
People did find ways to tint negatives and photographs to add some colour, but in recent years the advent of digital technology has made colourising images even easier. 
That’s where Old Ireland In Colour comes in. Nominated in TheJournal.ie‘s sponsored Best Irish Published Book category at this year’s An Post Irish Book Awards, it began as a personal project by John Breslin. He put the images he colourised online, they gained traction, and together with historian Sarah-Anne Buckley they have now been compiled into a stunning book.
Old Ireland in Colour features images from throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. There are over 170 photographs from all four provinces, and are accompanied by captions by Buckley.
What became Old Ireland In Colour began when Breslin decided to colourise some photographs of his grandparents. He started out doing it in Photoshop, but then was told about Deoldify. This is an artificial intelligence colouriser, which uses a deep learning technique to get better with each photo.
Breslin tried Deoldify and shared the results on social media (using photos that were out of copyright) and they became popular, so he set up a dedicated account. In the meantime, Deoldify continued to improve.
This year, he decided to turn the project into a book, and signed up to produce one with Merrion Press – bringing on board a colleague, Buckley. The pair had never met, but put the project together in early 2020, including during lockdown. 
They decided to put five themes in the book, and group the photos by theme. “We used a lot of photos from Ireland, different scenes from Ireland. But also a broad range of Irish people who we know or don’t know about, who had careers abroad,” said Breslin. 
Within each theme, the photos are displayed chronologically. “The book is about the development and changes in modern Ireland, so you want to see those changes over 125 years,” said Buckley. Most of the photos are in the public domain or have a creative commons license, and a small number needed copyright approval. 
Deoldify “works similarly to how we learn as people – we learn by example”, explained Breslin. “It learns by creating a model from millions of images and knows what to do next. It takes a whole series of colour images, takes the parallel black-and-white image, and essentially creates mapping between the colour version and shape and textures on the black and white ones. When it meets a new black-and-white image it learns from the trainings on colour.”
So trees, sky or sea “will nearly come out perfect all the time”, and faces also do well, but “sometimes if person is obscured or not recognisable it misses out on them”. Breslin then steps in and fix those images.
“If it’s something that involves a lot of uniforms that can be complex,” he said. “A large crowd of people, that would involve a lot of manual work.”
To ensure the images all reflect reality, he and Buckley used research to find out things like eye and hair colour, or military uniform details. While this can be “fairly straightforward for people who are well known”, it’s a little trickier for others. 
“A lot of these people would have travelled back and forth between Ireland and the US and UK,” said Breslin. So he consults records like those held at Ellis Island, where he found out that Countess Markievicz has blue eyes. 
“These things will never be 100% correct,” he cautioned. “We are trying to get the best guess for a lot of the colours. People lived their life in colour and we want people to see something approaching what you could see if the photo was taken in colour.”
  ‘It’s easier to resonate with people’
Colourisation has been going on since the early 1900s, but there is still a debate over whether it’s something that should happen at all. 
“As someone who hasn’t studied History since the 1980s, we are disconnected from history – that is obvious in various mutterings of the subject being downgraded,” said Breslin. “We are in a bitesize culture. When I studied History, the book was in black and white. It’s easier to resonate with people when things are in colour.”
But this isn’t the only benefit. “You will see things in colourised photos that you just didn’t notice before,” he said. In a photo of Tom Crean, the colourisation highlighted a bottle of sherry and pipe that didn’t stand out in the original version, but which add to the sense of what Crean was like as a person. 
There’s also not a question of the book somehow hoodwinking people into thinking these coloured photos are the original. “People know it’s colourised – it’s very obvious in the book that they were all in black and white and they were colourised,” said Breslin.
There are certain pictures that resonate with people. Pictures of people in extreme poverty, it really brings to life that these were people and they lived in very hard times.
“A lot of it was ensuring the context was there, that we were acknowledging the work of the history of photography,” added Buckley. “We were placing it in a social history of Ireland, modern Ireland.”
She looked at each individual photograph and made sure that previous research in the  area was acknowledged and that factually the book was accurate. “[John Breslin] would have done a lot of research himself on material culture personal records, and I was adding to that,” said Buckley.

Thankfully, due to the digitisation of records, a lot of the information they were seeking was online. The pair also made sure “that all of the photographic and archival collections were acknowledged” in the book, and that there were references so that people could go and do more research themselves. 
“Which is the exciting part for us – that someone might look at one photograph but go off and follow the rabbit hole [of its history].”
Each photograph was carefully chosen. “We tried to be discerning in regards to what would add to this historical narrative and as we went along we were adding new photographs where we saw gaps,” said Buckley.
“We really tried to use the big national collections – the National Library of Ireland, the National Folklore Collection, publicly available photographs, so that if a reader wants to look at the black-and-white photo she can do that freely. That was important to us.”
They also did their best “to ensure the diversity of social class in Ireland was represented”.
“There are 173 photos and it is a very broad view, I think, and a broad perspective,” said Buckley. 
Buckley sees the advantage of colourising photos as “it seems to come more familiar to people and it just sparks an interest”. She said they’ve been told about the intergenerational appeal to the book, with family members often reading it together. 
“I think Irish people always have a huge interest in history. That’s something we’ve seen through the decade of centenaries,” said Buckley. “You can pick [the book] up and you can put it down again and spend an hour at it, and we love that.”
They accept that not everyone will be interested in colourisation, but feel the book has a broad appeal, said Buckley. “If it’s attracting people to delve more into Irish social history, I think as a historian that’s fantastic.”
“We’re very clear that this in no way a replacement for the original source. We would hope it might lead people to the primary document.”

A QUICK SCORE update from England, where it’s now Boris Johnson 0-2 Marcus Rashford. 
Rashford first campaigned for the UK government to extend a free school meals programme over the summer holidays – which Johnson’s government eventually agreed to do – and the United striker has since campaigned tirelessly to extend those meal vouchers into 2021.
Having seen the request rejected and derided in the House of Commons, Rashford took a phone call from Johnson earlier this week to hear the government had pulled another u-turn. 
His remarkable campaigning makes Rashford’s day-job seem rather mundane, with his latest commitment tomorrow’s international friendly with Ireland. 
“To be taking that on his shoulders and be genuinely wanting to make a difference, it’s a massive credit to him”, said Irish captain Seamus Coleman of Rashford ahead of tomorrow’s clash at Wembley.
“I think he should be applauded highly. He comes across as a very grounded young footballer, very talented as well. On the pitch, he’s top class. What he’s doing off the pitch is inspiring for all players in the Premier League, to dig in, get involved and help in any way you can with whatever causes you want to encourage. I think Marcus has done a remarkable job. He deserves all the credit in the world.” 
Coleman can speak from experience: he is deeply generous. This year alone he has donated €20,000 to help Ireland’s frontline health workers in the pandemic and pledged €15,000 to the Do it for Dan fundraising drive.

He also donated money to an emergency fund for the League of Ireland in the teeth of the April lockdown, and these are only the generous acts that have been publicised. 
“I’ve my own private social media accounts, not out there in the open for everyone” says Coleman.
“Certain things pop up, or people text you about certain things. Sometimes, some hit home with you more than others. Luckily enough by playing football I’ve earned some money out of it and I feel like it’s something to do to help people with. I’ve got two daughters myself and some of the cases I reach out to, it’s parents needing help for treatment with kids, or whatever the case may be. If you can help in any way you can it’s important.
It’s something I really enjoy doing. Sometimes I put my name towards it, sometimes I don’t. The reason I put my name towards is that the likes of yourselves get hold of it and then it gets recognition for the cause. And on the back of that more money can be raised. As a footballer, I think we’re in very privileged position and it’s nice to help people when you can.” 
Coleman is back in the Irish camp having missed last month’s window with a hamstring strain. “I watched from home in Slovakia, it was very disappointing for everyone involved, it was a very destructive week”, said the captain of the Euro 2020 play-off defeat. “Sitting at home wasn’t great when I wanted to be there. I thought the lads played every so well on the night and were unlucky on penalties.”

Ireland will finish their Nations League campaign against Wales and Bulgaria after Thursday’s meeting with England, their final games before World Cup qualifying gets underway next March.
Coleman will be 34 by the time that tournament swings around, but he isn’t considering following David McGoldrick into retirement anytime soon. 
“It’s not something in my mind. I would be one of those players who puts himself forward at club and country level until I’m not picked. I don’t think I’m important enough or I’m not as high profile as a Robbie Keane to have a retirement.
“I think whenever a manager decides to stop picking me at international level, that will be entirely up to him but I don’t think it will be a case of me saying I’ve had enough. Hopefully that won’t be the case anyway. I enjoy coming away with Ireland and I love playing for my club and I’ll see what that brings but at the moment it’s not something I’m thinking about.”

That hamstring strain interrupted a superb start to the season at Everton, and it’s fair to say Coleman has impressed Carlo Ancelotti thus far. The Italian has ranked Coleman among the best captains he has worked with, pretty heady praise given Ancelotti has previously worked with Paolo Maldini, John Terry, and Sergio Ramos. 
“I’m not doing anything special. Being at Everton so long, I feel it’s my job to keep the standards up. Unfortunately in recent times we had a change of manager on so many occasions but it’s important to keep that morale going and let people know what it means to play for the football club.
“For a manager like that to acknowledge to efforts that go on behind the scenes, because sometimes fans maybe can only see what’s going on for the 90 minutes, but for a manager to acknowledge what has to be done on a daily basis is a massive compliment and one I’m grateful for.” 
Coleman has found himself second-choice to Matt Doherty with Ireland so far, though he will likely get some game time across these three games. Kenny is considering Doherty as cover for injured left-back Enda Stevens, while the manager has also spoken about the possibility of playing both down the right flank in a 4-2-3-1 formation.

Sergeant Stuart Jackson said: “Just before 12.40am this morning, Police received a report about a large, noisy house party in the Penrose Street area. Officers attended a terraced property and located a large number of people inside.
“At one point, 19 people locked themselves in a bedroom and initially refused to come out. A further two people were found hiding in the attic.”
In Northern Ireland, there are three types of notices that can be issued to people for breaking the Covid-19 rules. Under the current restrictions, households are not allowed to mix indoors. 
A Covid 1 notice carries a minimum fine of £60 and is aimed at tackling anti-social behaviour or gatherings.

A Covid 2 notice is a prohibition notice and requires premises to stop what is considered to be unsafe activity. They can be issued to licenced premises or can be used to restrict house parties. If a premises breaches a prohibition notice, they can face a fine of up to £5,000 on conviction.
Sergeant Jackson added: “After issuing 32 Covid 1 notices, four Covid 2 notices and two fixed penalty tickets, police officers remained at the scene until people left the area. Just after 8.15am this morning, police received a further complaint that a party had restarted at the same address. Police again attended and issued a further eight Covid 1 notices.

Members of the victims’ families sat in court for the hearing before Mr Justice Sweeney.
The judge told the court the defendant had submitted a basis of plea, denying substantial preparation or planning and saying he was not motivated by an ideological cause, in contrast with the prosecution case which is that it was a terror attack.
Prosecutor Alison Morgan QC said the case merited a “whole life” sentencing.
The court had heard that several issues needed to be argued.
They included whether there was a substantial degree of pre-meditation and planning, whether it was for a religious, political or ideological cause and to what degree Saadallah’s mental state influenced his actions.
The judge adjourned sentencing until the week of 7 December.

On 20 June at 6.52pm, he was caught on CCTV discarding his rucksack and damaging what was believed to be a mobile phone which was later recovered.
He walked into Forbury Gardens at 6.54pm, where numerous members of the public were gathered.

This approval from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council allows the project to move to tender preparation in order to get a contractor at the start of next year to build the homes. 
Planning permission was secured for the project in July. It proposes to build 200 social homes and almost 400 affordable homes to rent or buy. 
The proposed site is located at Shanganagh, Shankill, south Dublin and the council will transfer part of its land at Shanganagh. 
Any proposal to dispose of, otherwise known as transferring, council land or property must be approved by elected council members.  
The DLR council on Monday voted to approve the transfer of these lands to the Land Development Agency (LDA). 
The LDA said on Twitter that it welcomes the decision. 
The agency said this development is the largest social and affordable scheme with planning permission in Ireland at the moment.

Adrian Lynch said there were more than a quarter of a million people who evade the licence fee and a further 140,000 households without a TV.
The director of audiences, channels and marketing at RTÉ added that the broadcaster was not looking to increase the licence fee, but instead wants the licensing system overhauled.
“We’re not looking to higher the licence fee, we’re just looking to have it reformed and fixed,” he said.
You’ve got about 140,000 no-TV homes and then you’ve got about 250,000 who don’t pay the licence fee.
“If you put all of that together you get 50 million euros and we’d be having a very different conversation in this room.”
He made the comments at the joint Oireachtas Committee on Media, Tourism, Arts, Sport, Culture and the Gaeltacht.
It met today to discuss public service broadcasting and the impact of Covid-19 on the media sector.
Lynch said Covid-19 had caused an immediate “sharp drop” in licence fee revenue and a decline in advertising revenue. That drop was more than 30%.
He said commercial income in the fourth quarter of the year had “stabilised to some degree”, as had income from the TV licence, but the outlook for 2021 remained “uncertain”.
“The toll of Brexit on the national economy, and commercial performance, is unknowable, he said.

The combination of a broken TV licence system and a precarious commercial environment exposes undeniable vulnerabilities for the national public service media.
Despite these difficulties he told the committee that RTÉ would deliver its planned €60 million cost-cutting plans over three years as proposed by the director general Dee Forbes last year.
He said that cost-cutting would be delivered through cost management, changes in the schedule and big sporting events being deferred to next year.
He said the broadcaster had revised the number of redundancies it was seeking from staff downwards from 200 to about 140 due to Covid-19.
He said 73 people were due to leave the National Symphony Orchestra and a voluntary exit package will be opened in January which will seek 60 to 70 people to leave at that point.
“Part of it is because we have been delivering such significant output and we’ve changed the way we are working significantly. There’s so much remote working and we really see that we need to keep these essential services on air.”
Lynch told the committee that RTÉ showed “clear public purpose” during this crisis and had also been a source of “companionship, diversion and connection for millions of people”.
Concerned union
The Irish secretary of the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), Seamus Dooley, told the committee the union was “gravely concerned” for the future of public service broadcasting in Ireland.
Dooley said the Media Minister Catherine Martin had provided “precious little clarity” on how the department proposed to assist in addressing the financial situation in RTÉ.
“There was no real recognition of the tsunami, which is engulfing the newspaper sector, in particular the regional press,” he said.
The focus on independent production within broadcasting ignores the existence of freelance workers – writers, photographers and videographers.

He said the union welcomed that the Future of Media Commission had commenced its work but he warned: “If we don’t see immediate action there will be no future for many media workers.”
At the onset of the pandemic, Dooley said the NUJ had called for a forum on the crisis facing the media industry.
“While initiatives were taken in respect of tourism, hospitality and the arts, no immediate, substantial measures were taken to assist the media apart from the welcome initiative in respect of independent commercial radio,” he said.
“While employment in the print, broadcasting and digital sector is not comparable to tourism, the implications for democracy, of a diminished media sector should be of concern to this committee.”
John Purcell, chairman of the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, called for an emergency taskforce to be established during the pandemic to assist media workers.
Purcell welcomed the establishment of the Commission of the Future of Media but warned that action to support the sector cannot wait until the conclusion of the process.
“We need action now to enable the survival of our services through the protracted Covid crisis which has intensified the already severe threats being faced by our broadcasters,” he told the committee.
The government and the minister cannot wait for the conclusion of the Commission on Media process to take action to ensure the survival of Irish broadcasting. If you do it will be too late for many.”

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS and the New York Times have joined US broadcaster NBC in projecting that Donald Trump won the state of Alaska, one of the four largely uncalled states still counting votes in the US.
Alaska famously takes many days to count votes after Election Day, and with 75% of the expected vote counted today, NBC has called the state for Trump. 
61% of the vote was counted by yesterday afternoon in Alaska, due in part to the logistics of collecting ballots in the vast and most sparsely populated state in the US.
It was expected that Trump would win the state, and so this result will not impact Biden’s route to the White House as it only accounts for three electoral votes out of 538. 
It was not a close race with Trump in the lead with 56.9% of the vote so far, according to NBC. A Democratic candidate hasn’t won in Alaska for decades.  
Biden is currently on 279 electoral votes and Trump is on 217, according to multiple projections.
A winner is yet to be called by the Associated Press and other media outlets in Georgia and North Carolina, where Joe Biden and Donald Trump are ahead respectively.
Some outlets projected Biden as the winner of Arizona early on, but many outlets including the New York Times have yet to call a winner for the state as votes are still being counted (Biden is also ahead here, but the gap has been narrowing). 
Biden was projected to win the presidency on Saturday, but Trump has not yet conceded. Yesterday, Biden said Trump’s refusal to concede was an “embarrassment” that will reflect poorly on his legacy.

The House and the Senate
Meanwhile, the Republican Party won another seat in the US Senate today – a victory in Alaska that puts it one vote away from a majority in the upper house of Congress.
Incumbent Dan Sullivan was easily reelected with more than 57% of the vote, according to CNN and NBC television projections.
His victory confirms the strong performance of the Republican Party in the congressional elections, which were held on the same day as the US presidential election.
The Republicans now have 50 seats, compared to 48 for the Democrats in the 100-seat Senate. Two seats are still to be filled in runoffs scheduled for 5 January in the southern state of Georgia.
The Democrats would have to win both seats to catch up with the Republicans and give Biden more room to implement his policies. It would then be Vice President Kamala Harris’s voice that would decide the tie in a 50-50 vote in her role as president of the Senate.
No law can be passed in the United States without the upper house, which also has the power to approve the president’s appointments: his secretaries, his ambassadors, and the judges, especially on the Supreme Court.

If the Senate remains Republican, Biden, who sat in it for 36 years, would have to use his skills of bi-partisanship and negotiation.
The President-elect said that he was confident that he would be able to work with a sufficient number of congressional lawmakers from the other side.

“I also want to thank those who have self-isolated after receiving a positive Covid-19 test result; or having been identified as a close contact of a confirmed case. Self-isolating is a vital measure in our efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19 and it is essential that all those asked to self-isolate continue to do so.
In recent weeks, the incidence of Covid-19 in Ireland has decreased as the country remains under Level 5 of restrictions. 
Earlier today, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the country will return to Level 3 in December, but government may also look at certain sectors to see if it could “moderate” Level 3.
On the issue of moving from Level 5, Martin said: “We are doing a lot of analysis of the data, sector by sector, to facilitate and inform the approach to exiting Level 5.
“We want to give indications so there will be some degree of preparation on the part of those who want and need to be prepared if we are in a good position at the end of this month.”

Speaking in the case of now adult victims of child abuse who wish to have their rapist named, Judge Tony Hunt said that his own interpretation of the law “must yield to that of the higher court”.
However, the judge told the court that in his view “the natural and ordinary meaning of the term ‘child’ does not encompass a deceased child or an adult”.
He was commenting on Section 252 of the Children Act 2001, which provides mandatory and automatic reporting restrictions in the case of “any proceedings for an offence against a child”.
Last month, the Court of Appeal found that these prohibitions extend to children who had died or since turned 18.
The Court of Appeal was ruling in an appeal by the media against restrictions imposed on the naming of a child and her mother, who had killed the child while suffering from depression.
“On that interpretation the operation of section 252 would automatically cease when the child concerned either died or became an adult,” the judge said today.
“In either of those events there would no longer be any child to which any protection conferred by the Act might apply.”
The judge also said he did not believe this interpretation “would have been either contrived or artificial”.
Case today
In the case before the Central Criminal Court today, lawyers for a 56-year-old convicted child rapist had previously submitted to the judge that their client cannot be identified because of the Act.
The man pleaded guilty in 2015 at the Central Criminal Court to the repeated rape and sexual assault of his wife’s two sons at his Co Wicklow home over a ten-year period.
The victims were under ten years old when the abuse started in 1993 and the attacks continued for a decade.
In March 2016, Mr Justice Tony Hunt imposed a prison term of 21 years, with the final five years suspended.
At that sentencing, the victims, who are now adults, told the court they wished to waive their statutory anonymity so their step-father can be named publicly.
However, because there were related cases to be prosecuted at Wicklow Circuit Criminal Court, the judge placed a stay on the waiving of the anonymity.

These cases have now finished and the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) is seeking, on behalf of his two victims, to have this stay lifted so that the convicted rapist can be identified.
This morning, Justice Hunt said while the Court of Appeal ruling means the section 252 prohibitions apply, there is still scope in that section to lift the restrictions where the court “is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so in the interests of the child”.
He accordingly made an order lifting all reporting restrictions in the case, saying he considers this was “in the public interest”.
But he placed a 28-day stay on his order pending an application to the Court of Appeal by the defendant.
He said that, having reviewed the testimony of the victims and their repeated assertions that they wish to be identified, he was satisfied that he should lift these prohibitions.
He said that “the act of a victim in publicly speaking out about their experiences can assist the victim in recovery from the effects of the crime” and can also encourage others in their position to come forward.

“This is massive,” says McNamee. “It’ll be prime time for watching and has never happened before. The fact that she hasn’t just been added to a big men’s bill is great.
“To get any sort of women’s sport on that prime slot and for it to be advertised the way it has been… I’ve seen it constantly being advertised on the TV.
“She’s bringing all the other names on the card up with her too. It’s the thing that always comes up with women’s sport and I’m probably sick of saying it as much as others are sick of hearing it, but unless people see it they’re not going to engage with it. 
The fact that they’ve given her this prime slot means more people are going to be exposed to the Katie Taylor brand and will be interested in seeing her future bouts. 
“They’ll probably tune in to catch the other fights as well and think ‘This is really interesting, maybe I should follow it a bit more’.
“It’s so good to see an Irish athlete headlining this sort of event. You think of all the girls sitting at home, and young boys as well.”

The Taoiseach said he has been very clear that his focus up to now has been on keeping the pressure on the virus and keeping everybody focused on adhering to the Level 5 restrictions “so there will be maximum flexibility and manoeuvrability at the end of this month and the beginning of December”.

He said the approach is working, adding that the “various measures we have taken since moving to Level 3 have resulted in a downward trajectory. Level 5 is accelerating that. We should acknowledge that”.

Martin said that targeting people who are most vulnerable to Covid-19 will be the immediate priority of government.
The high-level vaccine task force will be tasked with co-ordinating preparations and ensuring the nationwide roll out of a Covid-19 vaccine when one is safe and ready to be distributed, said Martin.
In August, the government set up a vaccine strategy committee under the chairmanship of the Department of Health, while the HSE set up its own group.
However, Cabinet decided yesterday that a “whole-of-government group”, which will take in expertise from outside government in regard to organising the logistical operations, is now needed.
Who is on the taskforce?
The group will be chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith from DCU. The Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan will also be on vaccine task force, as will Paul Reid, CEO of the HSE.
Senior civil servant and chair of the senior officials group on Covid-19, Liz Canavan, Barry Lowry, Government chief information officer; and Paul Quinn, Government chief procurement officer, will also sit on the taskforce.
In addition, there will be a nominee yet to be confirmed from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, who will be a logistics cold chain expert and a project management expert.
Earlier this week, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that their Covid-19 vaccine was 90% effective in its large-scale Phase 3 trial.

The vaccine requires two doses. This means twice the number of visits to a vaccination centre – or wherever it is administered. At best this would result in resource and administrative challenges in first world countries, but it presents a much more serious barrier for less developed countries.
Another serious roadblock is the temperature at which this vaccine needs to be stored: at -80 degrees.
This issue was raised by Labour leader Alan Kelly today in the Dáil.

Vaccines under consideration 
However, Martin said it is not the only vaccine in the works.
He explained that Ireland is part of a pre-purchase agreement with the European Commission.
Allocation of access to vaccine doses between Member States will be decided according to a set population distribution.
There are currently no Covid-19 vaccines authorised for use in Europe, but there is a portfolio of seven potential vaccines, explained the Taoiseach.
Advance Purchase Agreements have issued for three of these vaccines, and Ireland has opted-in to each. These include:
AstraZeneca, which is partnering with Oxford University
Janssen (owned by Johnson & Johnson)
Sanofi Pasteur – this will be formalised when the current phase of clinical trials of the vaccine have been completed (expected late December/early January).
The Taoiseach said the emerging news is that the Commission is on the cusp of signing, if it has not already signed, a deal with Pfizer and BioNTech.

“The President of the Commission has been leading that process and I have been in contact with her on it. It has been discussed at European Council meetings. Ultimately, it is the Commission’s target to have an agreement with seven consortia.
“There is enough funding across the European system for arrangements with six consortia and it will probably go to a seventh. We will need the full range of options throughout 2021 because the next issue will be manufacture.
“All of those agreements include specific dosage allocations that mean we would get approximately 1% of whatever the European procurement is… That will be very significant for us in terms of targeting the vulnerable and those who would be a priority in terms of the receipt of a vaccine,” said Martin.
Last month, a survey showed that over half of people in Ireland would take a Covid-19 vaccine if there was one.

Although we don’t know how long immunity lasts, the studies cited by Hiqa indicate that antibodies that respond to Covid-19 last between two to six months. 
It said that if natural immunity is short-lived, it would have “major policy implications relating to restriction of movements, convalescent plasma donation and vaccine
development”, and may require ”vaccine booster doses”.
“Current understanding of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is limited,” it emphasised.
The Health Information and Quality Authority (Hiqa) has today published the 12 pages of advice it submitted to the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) on this issue.
Dr Máirín Ryan, Hiqa’s Deputy CEO and Director of Health Technology Assessment, said that new evidence has demonstrated that reinfection can occur after recovery from SARS-CoV-2.
Evidence from 22 studies suggests that IgG antibody levels (the most common antibody in the blood) are sustained for at least two months after infection, and for some even up to six months.
The levels of neutralising antibodies (that can neutralise viruses like SARS-CoV-2), decline over time, especially in the later stages of follow-up. While this doesn’t offer a full picture of the body’s response to SARS-CoV-2, these data have implications for vaccine development, antibody testing and immunotherapy going forward.
Dr Ryan continued: “Worldwide, at least fourteen patients have been infected twice by SARS-CoV-2; these reinfections were confirmed by genetic evidence that showed the first and second infections were caused by different viral strains.
It is important to remember, however, that these are rare events.
Dr Ryan said that the “phenomenon of reinfection” has significant policy implications.
“Infection prevention and control, isolation and contact tracing considerations are not likely to differ for cases of reinfection compared with the first infection.
“Therefore, all public health advice, including hygiene and physical distancing, should apply to those who have recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection as immunity from reinfection cannot be assumed.”

The evidence summary also reviewed the current evidence on the maximum duration of immunity following infection.
Hiqa previously published evidence summaries on many aspects of the immune response following SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In this update, Hiqa has reviewed new evidence relating to the possibility of reinfection following recovery from SARS-CoV-2, as well as studies with longer follow-up looking at the duration of immunity following infection.

Tipperary defender Pádraic Maher.
Source: Laszlo Geczo/INPHO
The long-serving defender has racked up an impeccable number of displays for Tipperary throughout his career and picked up his sixth All-Star award last year.
Before he was whipped off, Maher had started and finished nearly all of the 55 consecutive championship games which he has amassed since his senior debut in 2009. 
He spent just 25 minutes off the pitch before the Limerick game but he missed as much in that defeat as he had in the previous 11 years.
He was nursing a knee injury in the weeks leading up to that Limerick game, and Callanan has no doubt that the Thurles Sarsfields man will hit his stride again soon.
“He was in a bit of bother the last few weeks,” Callanan tells the media just a few days after that defeat to Limerick.
“Paudie Maher is probably the greatest hurler in the country over the past decade so he’ll be back, as we all will, from our learnings from last Sunday evenings.
“Preparation obviously wasn’t ideal but no better man to come out and lead us the next day like he has throughout his career.
We all have responsibility and accountability after last Sunday, Paudie is a superb leader and person and player for Tipperary since he put on the jersey first. He will lead this team again.”
Callanan says his side are relieved to still be in contention in this year’s hurling championship after crashing out of the Munster SHC.
The defending All-Ireland champions were outgunned by the provincial holders earlier this month, slumping to a nine-point defeat which has condemned them to the qualifiers.
Aside from a Jake Morris goal which briefly left just one point between the sides, Liam Sheedy’s charges were chasing the game for much of the contest on a bitterly wet day. Callanan suspects they were worst weather conditions he has ever played in.
“Holding on to hurley was a challenge,” he recalls.
Tipperary now face Cork in Round 2 of the All-Ireland qualifiers this weekend where there are no safety nets left for either side. 
“It was very disappointing,” says Callanan.
“We didn’t meet the standards we set for ourselves. We had been happy with our preparation and the performance didn’t follow suit. Look it’s great to still have a chance it is very disappointing, the performance on Sunday.

“You couldn’t put it down to one area now, it just wasn’t us.
Any given day you might have two or three who didn’t get up to a level but the whole team didn’t get up to a level where we would like to be. 
“And look there were bad conditions but there were bad conditions for both teams so we had no excuse on that front.”
Cork will come into this meeting at the LIT Gaelic Grounds on the back of a win over Dublin where they got the chance to shake off the cobwebs from their previous defeat to Waterford.
Callanan notes that getting back on the pitch quickly can certainly help a team heal after a loss, and he has already reviewed the video of the Limerick game to get the painful lessons he needs to move forward.
“It’s very hard in real time to analyse what’s going on around the pitch,” he says. “You have to take a look back at it, evaluate what happened and then try and put that right.”

With all that behind him now, Callanan believes that the additional rest time will ultimately be beneficial for Tipperary.
“There’s elements of both. We were just delighted to be in the draw and [that] it wasn’t all over for us.
Straight away, you want a game to get back on the horse and get going again, and right the wrongs of Sunday evening. We’re just glad to be in the mix now and an extra week’s preparation won’t be any harm either. And getting the bodies freshened up and ready to go again.
“This time of year, it is taxing on the bodies as well so maybe the extra week will be a good thing as well. Either way, we were just happy. We would have played at 6 o’clock on Sunday evening if we had the opportunity.”
Séamus Callanan was speaking at the launch of NOW TV’s Hurl vs Hurley campaign which will see the nation vote on what is the definitive term for a hurler’s most prized possession.
The result of the poll will be revealed to the public on 12 November. To have your say visit HurlvHurley.com where you can cast your vote right now.

THERE HAVE BEEN some truly grotesque attempts at Irish accents in Hollywood films over the years.
But a trailer for a new film that hit social media last night has made an admirable attempt at breaking records for how many bad Irish accents you can fit into two minutes and thirty seconds.
Wild Mountain Thyme, filmed in Co Mayo in Autumn 2019, is the latest film from John Patrick Shanley, an Oscar winner back in 1988 for his film Moonstruck. 
And it has a star-studded cast with Emily Blunt, Jamie Dornan, Jon Hamm and Christopher Walken. 
As for the plot? Stop me if you heard this one before.
The blurb says: “An epic love story with soaring lyricism, Wild Mountain Thyme is set against the breath-taking landscapes of rural Ireland, where everyone is half mad with loneliness or love, and the weather is terrible.

Anthony and Rosemary are star-crossed lovers, whose families are caught up in a feud over a hotly contested patch of land that separates their two farms.
Anthony (Dornan) always seems to be out in the fields working, worn down by his father’s constant belittling. But what really stings is his father’s threat to bequeath the family farm to his American cousin Adam. Rosemary (Blunt) at first seems to hold a grudge for having been shamed by Anthony in childhood, but the sparks between them would keep a bonfire blazing through the night. Her mother Aoife strives to unite the families before it is too late.
“Just when we think Anthony will pluck up the courage to face up to his repressed feelings, cousin Adam (Hamm) steps in with a plan to sweep Rosemary off her feet, romancing her over a magical 24 hours in Manhattan. But true love is never defeated!”
There are a great many stereotypes around about the Irish, but “the sparks between them would keep a bonfire blazing through the night” is a new one.
Anyway.
It all sounds very dramatic but, to Irish ears, it’s hard to hear beyond the accents in the trailer.
As one caller to RTÉ’s Liveline today put it: “For an Irishman, Jamie Dornan has one of the worst Irish accents I’ve ever heard.”
There are so many aspects to pick apart in the trailer – much of it set to Will Ye Go, Lassie Go – but a personal favourite currently is hearing Christopher Walken say “you take after John Kelly and that man was as mad as the full moon”. A commonly-used phrase in “half mad rural Ireland”, of course.

The story is adapted from the play Outside Mullingar by Shanley, which ran on Broadway in 2014 and received a Tony Award nomination for best play. 
This kind of portrayal is aimed squarely at an American audience, it is due to be released in cinemas there and on demand on 11 December. 
There’s no Irish release date as of yet but, after months and months of cinemas being closed this year, you’d have to give it a go when they open again?

THE POLICING AUTHORITY has issued a report detailing the number of times Gardaí used enforcement powers in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
The North Western Region accounted for 242 incidents since 8 April, and remains the region with the highest number of incidents where Covid-19 powers were used.
Galway and Cavan/Monaghan remain the two divisions with the highest number of incidents where Covid-19 regulations are used by Gardaí, but the Policing Authority report said that an “examination of data at station level does not identify any issues of the use of powers being centralised in one locality”.
Reported use of Covid-19 policing powers by Garda Division, 8 April - 31 October.
Source: Policing Authority report
Since 8 April, the Garda Síochána have exercised powers under Covid-19 regulations 702 times.
In the past month, there have been 103 incidents where Gardaí had to use powers under the Covid-19 regulations, with most of these relating to inspecting licenced premises. 
Garda Síochána have reported over 50,000 visits to licensed premises, of which approximately 60% were recorded as being closed.
Around 3,900 inspections were carried out over the Bank Holiday weekend of 23-26 October, with 80% of licenced premises inspected recorded as being closed.
Excluding Operation Navigation, there have been 394 incidents where powers under the Covid-19 regulations were used, of which 353 relate to breaches which occurred during the initial lockdown and subsequent policing of the pandemic up to 28 June.
(Operation Navigation is where Garda members conduct spot checks to see if Covid-19 guidelines are being followed, for example, at a pub to see if substantial meals are served.)

Since 28 June, the Garda Síochána have reported the following non-Operation Navigation enforcements:
8 incidents relating to breaches regarding face coverings;
5 incidents relating to breaches regarding international travel;
11 incidents of suspected breaches of regulations by retailers and,
37 incidents relating to other breaches (for example, organising events)
Source: Policing Authority report
The use of anti-spit hoods has also decreased, from 30 times in April and 36 in May, to 6 in September and 5 in October. These hoods have been used most frequently in the Dublin Metropolitan Region, which accounted for 51 of 118 incidents. In 74 incidents the Garda member perceived the detainee to show ‘obvious signs of intoxication’.
The 15-page report covers up to 31 October, and so doesn’t cover the full period of the Level 5 restrictions which were brought in on Wednesday 21 October, or the new Garda powers that were introduced last month. 
New Garda enforcement powers were signed into law last month: giving them the powers to fine people who organise house parties or who break other Covid restrictions. These are ‘fixed penalty notices’ – though the Authority says there is “some work required to actually implement the system of fines”, adding it “may be some time” before a Garda issues one of these fines.

The Policing Authority said that deciding what is an essential retailer, policing the border counties, and policing anti-mask protests are among the difficulties faced by the force:
…There has been added complexity through the increased remit in what is counted as “essential retail” with some retailers attempting to stay open by stocking items which are deemed essential while still selling items which are not deemed essential, and confusion as to what products are essential. This has created an addition avenue for the Garda Síochána to police which is not solely a resource challenge but also a challenge to the consistency in policing, given lack of definition and degree of interpretation in this area.
…The policing of protests is an ongoing challenge for the Garda Síochána, particularly with respect to those protests against the use of facemasks and the Covid-19 restrictions themselves. The facilitation of police protests in the context of the pandemic remains a risk. If not properly managed, it presents the potential for negative engagement between protestors from different sides and between protestors and Gardaí.
The Authority has said repeatedly that emergency powers for Gardaí should be “as limited as possible and used as sparingly as possible”.
In its report today, it explains the thinking behind this view: “One of the virtues of the penal provisions introduced thus far has been that they involve referral by the Garda Síochána to the Director of Public Prosecutions. That has been an important source of detached decision-making in respect of emergency powers and the decisions thus taken represent an important setting of standards.
“The fixed penalty notice does not have such an in-built check,” it added.
“There may be significant value in their introduction so relatively close to the projected end of the Level 5 stage being the subject of further consideration.”","The Policing Authority has said Garda powers to enforce Covid restrictions should be as limited as possible, and used sparingly.",7,0,0,48354,"Nov 11th 2020, 2:25 PM"
875,189,"Pre-Brexit stockpiling creating surge in Irish Sea shipping demand",https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-stockpiling-irish-sea-5263216-Nov2020/,"IRISH SEA SHIPPING services are experiencing a surge in demand as businesses stockpile amid continuing uncertainty around post-Brexit trading arrangements.
Stena Line, which transports 65% of the freight moving between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, has chartered an extra ship to meet the capacity requirements.
Despite a year that has seen overall demand for freight services hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, dipping by as much as 30% in April, the volume of stock Stena Line moved across the Irish Sea last week was up 6% on the same week in 2019.
Paul Grant, Stena Line’s Irish Sea trade director, told the PA news agency: “We’re seeing big demand pre-Brexit.
“I think you can see people are anxious to get their stuff across and make sure they’ve got enough stock ahead of 1 January.”
That date marks the end of the Brexit transition period and the commencement of trading arrangements governed by the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Under the protocol, which is contained in the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, Northern Ireland will remain in the EU single market for goods.
That will require additional SPS (sanitary and phytosanitary) checks on animal-based products entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.
The UK and EU have yet to agree a practical framework which could potentially minimise the number of new regulatory checks required.
The major supermarket chains are among those warning about potential disruption to supply lines in the new year if an agreement does not emerge.
Grant said it is “amazing” that there is still uncertainty over the level of checks which will be required with only seven weeks to go before the protocol comes into force.
“We can’t afford for there to be hold-ups and bottlenecks so we’re working with the authorities and the port operators and so forth to make sure that we can make it as seamless as it can possibly be,” he said.
“The challenge for everybody is the fact that there’s so much uncertainty and so much infrastructure is yet to be built.
“We’ve done our part in terms of putting on the ferry capacity and I think the hauliers for their part have done their part in making sure that their supply lines work, but it’s actually making sure that all these checks and processes are in place for the hauliers.”
Grant said most of the stockpiling involves goods coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain, through Cairnryan and Liverpool, but he said there is evidence of the same trend going the other way.
“The Northern Ireland Protocol question – that is the big question and no-one can answer that one yet,” he said.

“And we’re seven weeks away, it’s amazing.”
Stena Line this week marks the 25th anniversary of the Swedish-owned company setting up operations in Belfast after moving from Larne Port.
In that period it has transported 33 million passengers, seven million cars and seven million freight units across the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.
Grant said 2020 has undoubtedly been the most challenging year of the last 25, with the company having to deal with the impact of both Brexit and coronavirus.
Passenger numbers are down 50% on last year due to the pandemic.
However, Grant expressed confidence that demand will return and that ferry travel may emerge more popular than ever, given the ability to socially distance and access fresh air during journeys.
Looking to the future, Grant said Stena Line’s key focus is on sustainability and efforts to increase fuel efficiency and develop new eco-friendly technologies.","Stena Line has chartered an extra ship in response to the increased movement of goods.",10,0,1,22318,"Nov 11th 2020, 2:15 PM"

THE LICENSED VINTNERS Association (LVA) and the Vintners Federation of Ireland (VFI) has expressed concerns the country will face a “two-tier Christmas” if the hospitality sector remains closed after Level 5 restrictions are lifted. 
Once the current six-week lockdown is over, it is envisaged that the country will remain at Level 3 until the New Year.
However, under Level 3, restaurants, cafes and pubs can only remain open for takeaway and delivery and outdoor dining or service to a maximum of 15 people.
It is understood that during a briefing with business groups on 19 October, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar also said the aim is to get the country back to Level 3 by 1 December.
It is understood the Tánaiste is not optimistic that pubs will be able to reopen their doors by Christmas.
If Level 2 was signed off on in December, it would allow them to reopen indoor services, with additional social distancing restrictions in place.
The LVA and VFI have said pub staff from all across the country are contacting their employers to ask if they can return to work in December, saying they can’t afford Christmas for their families on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP). 
One third of the pubs in Dublin (approximately 250) have not opened for a single day since 15 March, while almost half of the pubs throughout the country traded for a total of just over two weeks during that period, before being closed again when the government tightened restrictions, the vintners said.

Pubs and restaurants face Christmas uncertainty due to restrictions
“If pubs and the rest of the hospitality sector are kept closed in December, while the rest of the economy is allowed to trade then there will be a two-tier Christmas in this country,” said Donall O’Keeffe, Chief Executive of the LVA.
It’s not ok for the government to impose this burden on tens of thousands of families all across Ireland. It’s not ok for government policy to be creating a ‘haves and have nots’ division all over the country around Christmas.
Padraig Cribben, Chief Executive of the VFI said: “Limiting hospitality businesses to a 15 person outdoor capacity simply won’t do in December. The government might as well just take the keys away for most of these businesses. It certainly won’t allow 90% of the sector to go back to work.
Publicans and their staff have already proved they can successfully and safely open under government guidelines. This was shown when the food pubs reopened in June and when the traditional pubs outside Dublin reopened towards the end of September.
“We hope the government will realise the importance of fostering Christmas goodwill for all sectors, this year of all years.”
Retail
Retail Ireland, meanwhile, has today called on the government to unwind the restrictions on retail trading in advance of December in response to reduced Covid case numbers and the need to manage Christmas trading safely over the coming weeks.

“The four-week review of current Covid restrictions should move to unwind retail restrictions to better facilitate a safe and socially distanced Christmas shopping experience,” Retail Ireland director Arnold Dillon said. 
“A short three-week shopping window in December will create significant additional challenges for retailers working to manage numbers in stores and reduce the need for queues,” Dillon said. 
“The run up to Christmas is make or break for many retailers. Many are relying on the period to make up for the major financial hit taken earlier in the year. While significant government supports are welcome, more is needed to help retailers manage commercial rent liabilities that continue to accrue during lockdown,” he said.

COVID-19 TESTING CENTRES will be fully operational in Cork and Shannon Airports from tomorrow.
The two express turnaround testing facilities will provide the pre-departure tests for passengers flying out of the airports in accordance with the EU’s traffic light system.
The rollout of the testing facilities comes as after it was reported yesterday that from midnight 29 November travellers arriving into Ireland from so-called ‘red’ regions in the EU will be allowed to move freely once they pass a PCR Covid-19 test five days following their arrival.
This provision will also be available to arrivals from orange regions who may not have availed of a pre-departure test. 
The move could have a significant impact on people travelling at Christmas as it will limit the number of days people have to spend in self-isolation once they arrive.
Transport Minister Eamon Ryan has said the government wants to make sure that any new testing system does not impede on HSE capacity.
He said the government has been engaging with the Dublin Airport which has engaged with about 20 providers that can supply Covid-19 tests.
The minister confirmed today that State airports are to establish additional private testing facilities at Dublin Airport, as well as Cork and Shannon airports.  
“This will facilitate pre-departure testing for travellers to other countries where the need arises.  It will also facilitate post-arrival tests for persons arriving from red regions who may choose to return to the airport five days after arrival to take the test.  
“Cork and Shannon Airports are expected to open facilities shortly and the facility at Dublin Airport is expected to be operational by 29 November,” he said.
Testing availability
RocDoc, a private facilitator, will provide testing services to Cork and Shannon Airport, with test results available within a few hours. 
Drive thru testing, where there is no need to leave your vehicle, will be available for a standard test (LAMP) with results back the same day. This will cost €149 per test.
Express LAMP test with results back within a few hours will cost €199 per test.
A PCR test with results back in 1-3 working days at a cost of €159 is also available. 
Depending on what country passengers are travelling to, different tests, such as rapid tests, may be acceptable to the authorities in EU countries, and travellers are urged to check with the authorities in their destination country.
Currently, the only validated test recognised in Ireland is the PCR test. After someone is swabbed, the PCR test has to be sent to a lab for analysis. 
However, subject to the ongoing review of testing by NPHET and Government, only a negative PCR test result means a passenger arriving into Ireland is not expected to follow advice to restrict movements.
Testing technology and delivery options for facilitating international travel will be kept under review, said the government.
The National Virus Reference Laboratory (NVRL) is currently carrying out a validation process on LAMP testing, it is understood. If approved by the Department of Health, the new test could be incorporated into Ireland’s testing regime in order to open up international travel again.
The LAMP test uses a throat and nose swab and differs from a PCR test, which is used by the HSE to detect the presence of Covid-19 at its test centres around the country. The LAMP test can be processed quickly without being sent to a laboratory.
Dublin Airport
The DAA says it has spent months working on potential pre-departure testing at airports. It is understood that passengers using Dublin Airport will be able to be tested pre-flight for Covid-19 after Cabinet approved a planning exemption for a privately run testing facility at the airport.
This will allow passengers from Ireland to travel to orange countries under the EU traffic light system, if they can bring a negative test result, and they will not have to restrict their movements for 14 days. 
Ultimately, the slow turnaround time and high cost of PCR test (the test for Covid-19 used at test centres around the country) means this method of testing
will not represent a viable, long-term testing option as traffic returns, the head of DAA Dalton Philips recently told an Oireachtas committee.
“The aim has to be to adopt testing technology that provides a rapid, affordable and scalable method of pre-departure testing.
“To truly get people moving again – and the economy firing, we will need to look at alternative options such as LAMP and Antigen testing. HIQA recently published a report which advised NPHET to consider implementing reliable rapid antigen tests to enhance
COVID-19 prevention and controls,” he said.
The commencement of airport Covid testing has been welcomed by Labour Transport Spokesperson, Duncan Smith, but he said the cost of the tests could be prohibitive.
“I have concerns in relation to the cost of these Covid tests that will be provided by private operators with tests estimated to cost between €100 and €200 per test. There will be many low paid workers and essential workers abroad coming back, taking advantage of affordable flights to travel home for Christmas who may not for economic reasons be able to afford the price of these tests.
“Many of these people will not have seen their families or been home since this time last year and will succumb to the understandable pressures to return home to see their loved ones. They should not be disadvantaged because of their economic circumstances,” he said.
He called on the government to temporarily subvent these tests for the period of December.
“We need compliance and personal responsibility but we also require take up of these tests and cost cannot be a barrier,” he said.
Smaller airports
A number of representatives from smaller regional airports were before the Oireachtas Transport Committee this morning.
Joe Gilmore, MD, Ireland West Airport: “What we are seeking is that government would continue to work with the airports and ourselves in mapping out a common system or pre departure testing at all Irish airports in advance of the Christmas travel period.”
“Like all the regional airports we have in the month of December, we’d have over 50,000 people that would use the airport. Most of those will travel from the UK market from nine destinations we serve, many those are looking to book at this stage and wondering can they return home for Christmas.”
In terms of testing, like the other airports, the airport is evaluating private operators to provide on-site testing.
“We would expect to have that in place when we would restart operations in mid December.”
Kerry Airport CEO John Mulherin said the airport is looking at the option of ensuring PCR testing for passengers through a local private healthcare facility at a cost that would be considered reasonable.
“We believe that offsite PCR testing one to two days prior to travel represents the best way forward for restrictions related to orange red or grey territories.”

He said he believes testing should be done off-site, not at the airports, but the airport will have an agreement with a private provider so details can be provided to those who need to travel this winter.
Mulherin also said he had asked for confirmation of how State aid rules would apply in relation to testing infrastructure and arrangements and he is waiting for confirmation from the government.
Speaking to RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, Minister of State for European Affairs Thomas Byrne TD said “we’re not encouraging people to come into the country unless they have to. So the situation hasn’t really changed”.
Byrne said “it’s important to remember that we’re still in Level 5 restrictions” and the move was a mechanism “to allow travel where that’s possible”.
Byrne stressed that the Government will not be providing any State capacity to provide PCR tests for arriving passengers and said he could not give any assurances that tests will be available for people travelling home for Christmas. 
“This is not about Christmas,” he said. “If those tests aren’t there we’ll still be telling people to restrict their movements for 14 days.”
He said airports are establishing centres and they should be able to fulfill the market requirements.
Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan last week warned that it is too early to say what the situation will be regarding travelling home to Ireland at Christmas as it depends on “a whole lot of factors that are simply unknowable at this time”.
“International travel is not safe and movement of people around areas with high incidence of this disease, particularly in Europe and North America, is not safe,” he said. 
Government sources have said that despite NPHET concerns about opening up travel, it is a government decision that Ireland align with other European countries in terms of reopening aviation and travel.
On 29 November, the new rules kick in for those who wish to travel from or travel into Ireland.
The Department of Foreign Affairs sets government policy on travel.
The department states that if you are considering travelling outside of Ireland, it continues to advise against non-essential travel overseas, other than to countries that are part of the EU ‘traffic lights’ approach, where the advice is to exercise a high degree of caution – this includes Great Britain but not Northern Ireland.’
Asked this morning about the risk of imported infection into Ireland through travel, Byrne said it will be vital that passengers travelling from ‘red’ regions are able to show a negative test result after five days or to restrict their movements for 14 days. 
“It’s still a pretty strict standard,” said Byrne, adding that the Government has not examined tests available on the private market. 
“We’re still saying that a PCR test is the test that people will have to fulfil,” he said. “This is not an open door to travel.”
He said people should not travel unless they have to. Byrne added that there is no legal requirement for people to restrict their movements – however, it is legally mandatory to fill out a passenger locator form.

The 1.4km dedicated cycle and pedestrian route will link the River Liffey with the Tolka Estuary, and will go through Dublin Port lands on the east side of East Wall Road and along Bond Road.
The design for the route includes a bridge for cyclists and pedestrians to safely cross over the busy Promenade Road, which links Dublin Port to the Dublin Port Tunnel and is one of the most heavily trafficked roads in the country.
The new linear space ranges from twelve metres to nine metres wide.
The Liffey-Tolka Project will link to a second port-city integration project, the Tolka Estuary Greenway – a 3.2km route along the northern perimeter of Dublin Port overlooking the Tolka Estuary. 
Dublin Port said it would apply to Dublin City Council for planning permission for the Liffey-Tolka Project by April 2021. The target is to begin construction by September 2021 and to finish the project by the third quarter of 2022.
On Monday, the government announced over €63 million would be allocated to improving and expanding on greenways around Ireland in 2021.

Commenting on Grafton Architects’ appointment, founder of Grafton Architects Shelley McNamara said: “The Liffey-Tolka Project to connect the River Liffey to the Tolka Estuary, along East Wall Road and Bond Road is not so small but, at the scale of the City it might be considered to be. However, its transformative effect will be immense.
The currently hostile East Wall Road will become a linear Civic Space. This will form a new sense of entry to the City when travelling from the North and from the Dublin Port Tunnel.
McNanara and her colleague Yvonne Farrell won the Pritzker Prize this year – architecture’s highest award. 
She continued: “The drama, scale and animation of the Port will be revealed, joining up with the life of the City. The visual barrier which currently separates these two interdependent worlds will disappear.
The pavement area will increase from a two metre width to twelve metres, offering a safe pleasurable landscaped space for people to walk or cycle. This new ribbon of space, bridging over Promenade Road, will connect the East Coast Trail and Dublin Port’s Tolka Estuary Greenway to the Liffey, terminating in a sunny public space on the water’s edge. This will be a new Urban Amenity for day to day use and for enjoyment in times of leisure.
“We developed a deep appreciation and understanding of Dublin Port from our work on The Flour Mill Masterplan and we are very excited now to have been appointed to bring a project as important to the City as the Liffey-Tolka Project to the consenting phase and, hopefully, to construction next year.”

Eamonn O’Reilly Chief Executive of Dublin Port said: “Delivering Masterplan 2040 is very complex and our focus to date has been on projects which deliver additional freight capacity. However, an equally important, albeit smaller part, of our Masterplan is integrating Dublin Port with Dublin City.
“We have been delivering projects such as the Diving Bell in 2015 and the Opening of Port Centre in 2017 as isolated stepping stones to integrate the Port with the City but, with today’s appointment of Grafton Architects to design the scheme to link the Liffey with the Tolka, we have cut the Gordian knot of the complex challenge to open up Dublin Port to Dubliners.
 “Dublin Port is not going anywhere, and we are committed to developing nationally important port infrastructure in accordance with the principles of proper planning and sustainable development.
This requires us not only to cater for the needs of cargo and commerce; we must also create real gain for the citizens of Dublin.
“Doing this in a small but extremely busy port requires great design and we are delighted to be working with Grafton Architects as we take on a unique challenge to integrate Dublin Port with Dublin City.
“We have been working with Grafton Architects for the past year to prepare the Flour Mill Masterplan as the blueprint for the redevelopment of the former Odlums Flour Mill on Alexandra Road.
This development is an integral part of our plans to deliver the €1.6 billion of port infrastructure projects required to bring Dublin Port to its ultimate capacity by 2040.","“We have cut the Gordian knot of the complex challenge to open up Dublin Port to Dubliners,” Dublin Port’s CEO said",10,0,1,25826,"Nov 11th 2020, 12:30 PM"

883,189,"Police were slow to respond to abduction fears, Nora Quoirin’s mother tells inquest",https://www.thejournal.ie/police-abduction-fears-nora-quoirin-5262978-Nov2020/,"THE MOTHER OF Irish-French teenager Nora Quoirin whose body was found near a Malaysian jungle resort where she vanished while on holiday has said evidence may have been lost because police were slow to act on the possibility that her daughter could have been abducted.
Meabh Quoirin told an inquest into her 15-year-old daughter’s death that she believed she heard “muffled and whispering” sounds of two people inside the family’s cottage the morning Nora Anne Quoirin disappeared, but she took no action because she was asleep and not fully conscious at the time.
Quoirin said police were more focused on search and rescue, and only started looking for fingerprints and interviewing resort staff several days later, by which time many people had passed through the property.
She said the police officer sent to take her statement also struggled to communicate in English and she had to explain herself repeatedly.
Some senior police officials who later approached her were also “quite rude and arrogant”, telling her to be calm and let police do their job, she said.
“My own understanding was that the dominant commitment was in search and rescue, and it took a long time to mobilise and explore any criminal route,” she told the inquest by videolink.
I believe that criminal evidence, if it existed, would have been lost during that time.
Nora’s disappearance from her family’s cottage, the day after they arrived at the Dusun eco-resort in southern Negeri Sembilan state on 4 August last year, sparked a massive search. Her naked body was found on 13 August beside a stream in a palm oil estate about 1.6 miles from the resort.
Police have told the inquest an investigation showed no criminal element, and there was no indication Nora had been abducted. Officers believe she climbed out of a window on her own, and the post-mortem examination showed she succumbed to intestinal bleeding due to starvation and stress.
But Meabh Quoirin and her French husband, Sebastien Quoirin, say Nora was kidnapped, because she had mental and physical disabilities and could not have wandered off on her own.
Quoirin broke down at one point during her four hours of evidence at the inquest.
She spoke at length about Nora’s disability, saying it would be almost impossible for her daughter — who weighed only 4st 7lb — to push open and climb out of a window with her limited strength and disability. The window could not be locked because the latch was broken.
The children were sleeping in the loft, while she and her husband were in the master bedroom downstairs, Quoirin said, adding that her younger daughter woke up near dusk to go to the toilet and noticed that Nora was already missing, but thought she had gone to sleep with her parents.
Quoirin said that at one point during the night she “was aware of muffled sounds inside”, like two people whispering.
“I was in between sleeping and being awake, so I wasn’t really processing my thoughts normally… it caused me no alarm because I wasn’t fully conscious.”

She said Nora would not necessarily have cried for help because she was “highly submissive”, which could prove why there were no marks of struggle on her body. “She would just be silent and stare at the floor and close in on herself,” she said.
The mother noted that the area where Nora was found had been repeatedly searched, and that given the steep and hilly terrain, her body was in fairly good condition, with only minor bruises and scratches.
“Why does her state of body not reflect that of someone constantly moving or exposed to the harshest of elements?” she said.
“I don’t want to speculate on the motivation of the abduction,” she said.
It is possible and reasonable to believe that any plan that was conceived at any point may have to change by the sheer volume of attention focused on Nora’s case. I believe that Nora could have subsequently been released by her captors.
Her husband is due to give evidence tomorrow. Nora’s two siblings will also give evidence in private.
Later this month, a British doctor who conducted a second post-mortem on the teenager’s body will also give evidence remotely.
The Quoirin family has sued the resort owner for alleged negligence, saying there was no security at the resort and a cottage window with a broken latch was found ajar the morning Nora disappeared.","Meabh Quoirin gave evidence by videolink from her London home.",2,0,0,17265,"Nov 11th 2020, 11:19 AM"

HONG KONG’S PRO-DEMOCRACY legislators have resigned en masse after the city’s government moved to disqualify four of them.
The pro-democracy camp announced the decision in a news conference, hours after the Hong Kong government said it would disqualify Alvin Yeung, Dennis Kwok, Kwok Ka-ki and Kenneth Leung from the legislature.
The disqualifications came after China’s National People’s Congress Standing Committee, which held meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday, passed a resolution saying those who support Hong Kong’s independence or refuse to acknowledge China’s sovereignty over the city, as well as commit acts that threaten national security or ask external forces to interfere in its affairs, should be disqualified.
“Today we will resign from our positions, because our partners, our colleagues, have been disqualified by the central government’s ruthless move,” Wu Chi-wai, convener of the pro-democracy camp, said at the news conference.
“We are facing a lot of difficulties in the coming future for the fight of democracy, but we will never, never give up,” he said.
Wu said the pro-democracy legislators will hand in their resignation letters on Thursday.

We have been asked to work from home, many businesses are closed, students are struggling with online learning while sports and culture are also effectively paused.
At the same time, we have seen some positive advances. Cycle lanes and greenways are appearing, our doctors can email prescriptions and conduct online consultations and people are rediscovering their local areas.
There are many important decisions which lie ahead in determining how we move forward as a country.  The next few months will be crucial for the direction of Irish society. We hear a lot about the “new normal” but what will it look like?
So far we have heard from many experts and interest groups in the approach to the pandemic, but apart from the occasional survey, we know little about what the Irish people want. There’s also been frustration from ordinary people when it seems like their daily experiences and concerns aren’t being considered. There are choices and trade-offs to be made, and it is important that we all have the chance to be heard when it comes to making those choices.
In Ireland, we have a new tradition of citizens’ assemblies which allow a small, randomly selected group to come together, discuss major issues and make recommendations. But we still do not have a real culture of citizen participation.
Yet many things depend on us as citizens and the policies implemented will have real impact on all our lives. It is up to us to provide our best ideas and to let policymakers know where we want to go.
Citizen participation is a process which allows people an opportunity to input their thoughts and to influence public decisions. It can be a real part of the democratic decision-making process.
One thing we have learned from the pandemic is that public trust and cooperation is an essential part of any public health response, yet rampant misinformation and a sense of disconnection between the public and decision-makers can lead to reluctance to follow guidance and the emergence of anti-science narratives. Giving citizens a voice in the process is an important part of creating a sense that we are all in this together. 
Up until now the main forum for participation has been through elections, and through civil society, but now as part of Science Foundation Ireland’s Science Week there is a platformfor people to make their voices heard. ChoosingOurFuture has brought together a range of experts on a number of topics. They will be leading discussions on issues which matter to us, the general public. We want to hear what people think of this expert input. We want the public to debate and discuss and to provide their own solutions and ideas.
We want to know your thoughts on vaccines, on housing, on education, the economy, the future of live music and the arts and sports. There are threads on all of these and more. You can, for example, join Professor Luke O’Neill to discuss vaccines or join the conversation on liveable cities with Dublin City Architect Ali Grehan.

We want to know how students think we can try to beat the boredom, stress and loneliness that many feel from online learning. On music, we want to hear about how we can support artists and musicians who cannot perform at the moment. Other conversations are on the economy where we are talking about balanced regional development, and about “doughnut economics” where we can decide how best to measure wellbeing. 
Importantly the conversations will be facilitated. The rules are that participants should be respectful of one another, people should listen to one another and no personal attacks will be tolerated.
A key belief driving this deliberative experiment is that if we can offer expert voices, and just as importantly, offer ordinary citizens the chance to engage with those expert voices, we can help to find innovative and appropriate solutions to policy problems while also increasing public trust and participation.
In other words, this forum is a space for the public to have a voice and an opportunity for policymakers to listen to citizens directly. We would invite everyone to register on ChoosingOurFuture.ie to join the conversation. Active debate is happening there now and will run until Friday, 13 November, 4pm.

The recall, which the brewer described as precautionary, impacts the Great Britain market, as the product was not yet on sale in Ireland.
Guinness 0.0 was launched last month amid much fanfare after a four year development process.
In a statement, Guinness said: “As a precautionary measure we are recalling Guinness 0.0 in Great Britain because of a microbiological contamination which may make some cans of Guinness 0.0 unsafe to consume.
“Guinness 0.0 currently is not on sale to the general public in Ireland. The issue is isolated to Guinness 0.0 and does not impact any other Guinness variants or brands.”
The company urged anyone with cans of Guinness 0.0 not to drink it.
The product was developed in response to what Guinness said was growing consumer appetite for non-alcohol, lower-calorie beverages.
It was created at the landmark St James’s gate brewery in Dublin.

The early stages of the brewing process mirror those of standard Guinness, with the same main ingredients used – water, barley, hops and yeast.

The Irish Independent reported this morning that the HSE had suspended the distribution of the vaccine after it emerged 600,000 were missing.
It reported that in a letter to GPs earlier this week, the HSE said that approximately 1.3 million doses of vaccine had been distributed to date, but only 700,000 of those were recorded as administered on the claims system used by healthcare professionals to reimburse costs. 
In a statement to TheJournal.ie, the HSE said it has full records of the 1.3 million doses which have been distributed to date this year. 
“Applications for reimbursement through PCRS have been made in relation to 700,000 doses which indicates that some of the vaccine that has been distributed has yet to be either administered and/or an application for reimbursement submitted,” the HSE said. 
“Therefore, we intend to obtain more information prior to distributing the remaining doses of vaccine.” 
The HSE’s Chief Clinical Officer Dr Colm Henry this morning clarified that “no doses have disappeared”. 
“We’ve records back and over 700,000 [vaccines] have been administered,” Henry told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland. 
“It’s normal for a lag time between us distributing the vaccine to GPs and pharmacies and records coming back as to who has been administered,” he said.
RTÉ has reported that there has been a delay in sending out the next 50,000 doses because the HSE wants to determine where supply is still needed. 
Henry said that the HSE is now seeing to find out where the greatest level of demand for the flu vaccine remains. 
“We’re very clear about those priority groups as per the WHO recommendations, namely older people over 65 years of age, healthcare workers in direct contact with patients, and other groups. That’s where we want to focus our remaining stock that we normally hold back,” Henry said.

“No vaccines have disappeared. We’ve held back as we normally do every year, in a year of unprecedented demand, 50,000 [vaccines] so we can ascertain where the gaps are, where the priority groups in most need of this vaccine are, and distribute those remaining 50,000 by the end of November,” he said. 
The HSE said that the most recent report “indicates that there is no evidence of influenza viruses circulating in the community in Ireland”. 
“If uptake among those in the at-risk groups and children aged 2-12 reflects the demand seen to date, twice as many people may be vaccinated this year as in the 2019/20 vaccination season,” the HSE said. 
“This will help to limit the spread of the flu in the community and to limit the impact of the flu on the health service,” it said. 
“In addition, infection control prevention measures which the public is being asked to follow to prevent the spread of Covid-19 will also prevent the spread of flu. Observing social distancing, practicing good respiratory/hand hygiene, wearing of face coverings and staying at home if we have symptoms will also prevent the spread of the flu,” it said.

The online petition attracted a record number of signatories after being launched on 12 October by former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd, a frequent target of newspapers controlled by Murdoch’s News Corp.
The Australian arm of the New York-headquartered company is the country’s largest media organisation, owning papers in nearly every major city as well as cable television networks and magazines.
Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, a prominent politician from the minor Greens party, said the Senate had backed her push to probe the lack of news media diversity in Australia.
“Very glad to see the Senate support this and establish an inquiry immediately,” she tweeted.
“Australians have become increasingly concerned about the concentration of media ownership and the power and political influence of Murdoch.”
The country’s opposition parties united behind the move in the Senate to effectively sidestep the conservative government, which enjoys strong support from the Murdoch press and had not acted on the petition’s demand for a royal commission.
In launching the petition, Rudd decried News Corp as a “cancer on our democracy” operating an effective “monopoly”.
“This power is routinely used to attack opponents in business and politics by blending editorial opinion with news reporting,” the petition stated. 
“These facts chill free speech and undermine public debate.”

Rudd, who was prime minister from 2007 to 2010 and briefly in 2013, has long been critical of what he says is the media organisation’s “vicious” campaigning for the political right.

The petition also garnered support from former Liberal prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, who was ousted by hardline conservatives in a 2018 party coup supported by the Murdoch press.

She didn’t see those iconic rivalries settled in the ring at the time because, to her recollection, there was no Sky Sports in the family home in Bray until some time afterwards.
But 25-odd years on, she is living her own legend, cultivating it on the same platform: her blood-curdling wars with Belgian nemesis Delfine Persoon were worthy of their Box Office stages at Madison Square Garden and Matchroom’s Covid-time Fight Camp respectively and worth the 20-bob pay-per-view fee on their own merit for those who had it to spare.
And there have been off-Broadway milestones, too, not least Taylor’s two ‘headline’ appearances to date: against Jessica McCaskill in 2017, the first ever female bout to top a bill on Sky Sports; and the momentous occasion that was Manchester last November, when the home crowd moved the Irishwoman to tears such was the deafening acclaim with which they received her as she attempted to conduct a post-fight interview following a hard-earned victory over Christina Linardatou in the poster-topper.
Her transformative impact on women’s professional boxing has been swift, unparalleled and undeniable. But one wouldn’t need to dust off the aforementioned landmarks to find caveats: the electrifying Persoon bouts were each succeeded by headlining heavyweight action; her curtain-raiser against McCaskill unusually took place midweek at which time its only competition might well have been some kind of angling championship; and while she was officially sold as ‘the main event’ in Manchester this time last year, it was ostensibly a card designed to bid farewell to Mancunian darling Anthony Crolla, who fought last on the night — and for the last time ever — after Taylor took her leave with the belt which made her a two-weight world champion.
Her next fight in five days’ time will be markedly and marketably different. No caveats. Saturday night. Primetime on Sky Sports. The star attraction on a night in which the fights involving men are designed only to tee up three consecutive female world-title fights, the last of which will be Taylor’s undisputed lightweight title defence against Miriam Gutierrez of Spain.
And it will be free-to-air for anybody who has a decent internet connection, whether or not they have Sky Sports or even a television: Taylor-Guttierez and its accompanying support bouts will stream live on Facebook, YouTube and the Sky Sports website as well and beam live on Sky Sports Mix and Sky Sports Main Event.
Taylor herself tends to let neither the magnitude of her personal achievements nor her cultural significance within professional boxing sink in, even when invited to. “When you’re actually speaking about it, I’m thinking to myself, ‘Wow, that is great!’” she laughs. “Right now, I’m just focusing on my own performance and the fight itself [versus Gutierrez]. I guess it’ll be only when I retire, when I’m actually looking back on these things, I’ll think, ‘Oh, gosh — that really was legacy-building; that really was fantastic.’”
But she is at least willing to embrace the significance of Saturday night being so freely accessible to eyes everywhere, a bonus that dovetails perfectly with one of her primary objectives.
“I am so privileged to be in this position and what a great opportunity it is on Saturday to actually showcase my talents to people who may never have had Sky Sports before,” says the undisputed 135-pound champion.
“For young kids to actually be able to watch this fight for free is absolutely fantastic. And what a great opportunity it is for myself personally and for every other fighter on the card: it’s an extra platform to inspire these young girls and young boys.
“I suppose I want girls to grow up and do even better than I have in my career and that’s what true legacy looks like.
I want those young girls to grow up and be multiple-times world champion and multiple-time Olympic champions, and to be considered the best ever. I just want fighters of the next generation to dream big dreams, I suppose.
“When I was growing up, there wasn’t any Olympics around, there wasn’t female boxers on professional cards.
The fact that women’s boxing is in the Olympics to stay is incredible; the fact that there is a female boxing match on every single [professional] boxing card now, which is insane. And the fact that there are three female world-title fights on the one bill this weekend — I never thought I’d see that, growing up. So, that in itself is a great legacy.

Anthony Joshua agrees. On Sunday night, the heavyweight beltholder again turned Taylor cheerleader on Sky Sports, saying:
I can’t even put it into words. She’s special. Sometimes you get a few fighters that come along in this world and they’re special, and they leave a mark. She’ll definitely be one of those people that leave a mark on the boxing industry.
And though Taylor is generally impervious to outside noise, particularly on fight week, some comments naturally slip her guard.
“From such a legacy-building fighter himself, that obviously means so much,” she says.

“Anthony Joshua has always been such a huge supporter of myself over the last few years, and of women’s boxing itself, so very, very grateful for those comments.
“It’s always obviously great to hear nice things about yourself, isn’t it?” she laughs.
“When it’s coming from someone like Anthony Joshua, that makes it even more special.”
Both 2012 Olympic gold medallists share a promoter in Eddie Hearn, who in an Instagram post earlier this year unveiled a massive mural in his Matchroom Boxing headquarters consisting of a handful of his company’s flagship fighters from past and present. Joshua, the biggest star of them all, is painted front-and-centre from where he is flanked by three fellow British boxing kings, and Irish boxing queen. Incidentally, Taylor was recently invited to give a tour of her own HQ on the soon-to-be rebooted MTV series Cribs, whose researcher can probably still hear Brian Peters’ laugh ringing in their ears.

Taylor would at least have her newly bought house in Connecticut to show off, complete with its basement boxing gym. One of her more recent opponents, Brazilian Rose Volante of whom she relieved the WBO lightweight title 18 months ago, was herself able to purchase a home for her mother with the spoils from her first career defeat at Taylor’s hands — and the fact that she was paid significantly less than her conqueror is an indication as to Taylor’s financial standing within the sport currently.
She doesn’t earn ‘Anthony Joshua money’ in the tens of millions per fight but the 34-year-old is, by a significant margin, the highest female earner in combat sports. For further context, all-time great mixed martial artist Amanda Nunes walked away with a reported $450,000 disclosed purse after beating Felicia Spencer to retain her UFC featherweight title in June; two months later, Taylor earned somewhere in the region of three times that for her rematch with Persoon, a fee which included a share of the Sky Sports Box Office pay-per-view revenue in Ireland.
Indeed, using Forbes’ 2020 Top 10 list as the measuring stick, the Bray woman may soon become the highest-earning non-tennis player in all of women’s sport — if she isn’t already. With three big fights next year, she would conceivably knock on the door of the top five overall, albeit her decision not to disclose her fight purses and commercial endorsements likely precludes her from such lists — which is exactly the point.
She is, however, an outlier in her own field, and the debate about pay in professional women’s boxing has been particularly prominent this week, with Irish-American former world champion Heather Hardy lambasting promoter Hearn for an interview during which he stressed the need to increase female fighters’ commercial value in order for them to achieve financial parity with their male equivalents.
Taylor, aware of her unique position, is measured in her contribution to that particular strand of discourse, expressing her appreciation for her own level of income while stressing the need for her contemporaries to reap more reward from their graft and craft. In the end, her message is simple: all in good time.
“The exposure is there now and people are genuinely interested in women’s boxing now,” she says.
“We’ve obviously made great ground over the past few years with the purses and hopefully, that continues as well.
“I would love to see the purses rising, obviously. I’m personally very happy with the purses I receive for the fights each and every time…but I wouldn’t say no to a pay rise, either!
“But I am very, very happy and I feel very privileged to be in the position that I am in, headlining fights and getting the purses that I have been getting.
“I guess [female boxing pay] is very low in comparison to what the men are getting but that’s the way it is, really. I hope that it increases. We’re slowly building ground. It takes time, I think, to build ground with stuff like that.
“We have done great things over the last few years and hopefully, that will keep rising.”
In the meantime, she will fight to ensure that her own Sky-high ascent continues.","Katie Taylor on her free-to-air fight this Saturday, her cultural significance in professional boxing, and the debate over female fighters’ earnings.",24,0,0,22990,"Nov 11th 2020, 8:00 AM"

894,209,"Three Trump loyalists appointed to top Pentagon jobs as Defence Secretary fired",https://www.thejournal.ie/trump-loyalists-defence-secretary-fired-5262770-Nov2020/,"A DAY AFTER Donald Trump fired Defence Secretary Mark Esper, three staunch loyalists to the president have been appointed to senior defence jobs.
Among them was a former Fox News commentator who failed to pass Senate confirmation because of offensive remarks he made, including about Islam.
The abrupt changes sent reverberations through the Pentagon as nervous civilian and military personnel waited for more developments. And they fuelled worries of a wider effort to drum out anyone considered not loyal enough to Trump.
The unease was palpable inside the building throughout the day over concerns about what the Trump administration may do in the months before President-elect Joe Biden takes office, and whether there will be a greater effort to politicise the historically apolitical military.
While radical policy shifts seem unlikely before the 20 January inauguration, the changes could further damage prospects for a smooth transition already hampered by Trump’s refusal to concede his election loss.
James Anderson, who had been acting under-secretary for policy, resigned yesterday morning and was quickly replaced by Anthony Tata, a retired army one-star general.
A short time later, Joseph Kernan, a retired navy vice-admiral, stepped down as under-secretary for intelligence, hastening what had been an already planned post-election departure. Kernan was replaced by Ezra Cohen-Watnick, who becomes acting under-secretary for intelligence.
The departures came on Christopher Miller’s second day on the job as defence chief. Miller also brought in his own chief of staff in Kash Patel, who, like Cohen-Watnick, is considered staunchly loyal to Trump and previously worked at the National Security Council.

After firing his defence secretary, Trump reportedly wants FBI and CIA chiefs gone too
Patel was among the small group of aides who travelled with Trump extensively during the final stretch of the campaign. He is also a former prosecutor in the national security division of the Department of Justice and former staff member on the House Intelligence Committee. In that post, he was a top aide to Republican representative Devin Nunes, leading the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Patel was linked in media accounts to efforts to discredit the investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.
This is Trump’s second attempt to secure the policy job for Tata, who has been a regular commentator on Fox News.
Earlier this year, Trump appointed Tata to the post, but the Senate cancelled a hearing on the nomination when it became clear it would be difficult if not impossible to have him confirmed. Tata withdrew his name from consideration for the job, which is the third-highest position in the department, and Trump then appointed him to serve in the job of deputy under-secretary.
According to media reports, Tata posted tweets in 2018 calling Islam the “most oppressive violent religion I know of,” and called former President Barack Obama a “terrorist leader” and referred to him as Muslim. The tweets were later taken down.

At the time of the Senate hearing, Democratic representative Adam Smith, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said Trump must not prioritise loyalty over competence and install someone in a job if the “appointee cannot gain the support of the Senate, as is clearly the case with Tata”.
While the personnel changes added to the tumult in the wake of Esper’s departure, it’s not clear how much impact they could have on the massive Pentagon bureaucracy. The department is anchored by the tenet of civilian control of the military, and much of its day-to-day activities are conducted by career policy experts and military leaders who adhere to a strict chain of command.","Military personnel changes have fuelled concerns of a push against figures seen as not loyal enough to Trump.",25,0,1,45380,"Nov 11th 2020, 7:26 AM"

The company’s Dublin operation currently employs almost 900 people and plans to bring its employee numbers here to 1,100 by early 2021. 
The announcement comes after the opening of the company’s Europe, Middle East, Africa Trust and Safety Hub in Dublin earlier this year.  The new roles will be across trust and safety, data privacy and protection, and commercial. 
The company had also previously announced plans to establish a European data centre here over the next two years. The €420 million data centre, the company’s first in Europe, is to be operational by 2022 and signals TikTok’s “long-term commitment” to Ireland. 
Taoiseach Micheál Martin hailed the app as an “amazing success story” while welcoming today’s announcement. 
“I welcome TikTok’s commitment to Ireland and its pledge to increase numbers to over 1,100 in 2021. These are high-quality jobs, but more specifically, they are aimed at ensuring that people can use the app safely while upholding the highest data protection standards,” Martin said. 
“In less than a year, Ireland has rapidly become a vital centre for both our European and global operations,” Vanessa Pappas, Interim Head of TikTok said. 
Its strong pool of skilled and diverse talent, booming digital and technology sector, and rich heritage of arts and culture, make it such an attractive base for a platform that prides itself on being an inclusive home for creative expression
Meanwhile, TikTok asked a Washington court yesterday to stop an order from US President Donald Trump’s administration from taking effect this week as the White House seeks to ban the Chinese-owned app in the United States.
Chinese company ByteDance is facing a Thursday deadline to restructure ownership of the app in the United States to meet US security concerns.
In its court petition, TikTok asked for more time, saying it has not received enough feedback on its proposed solution.
The company said in a statement that it had asked the government for a 30-day extension because it was “facing continual new requests and no clarity on whether our proposed solutions would be accepted” but it had not been granted.
It was turning to the court for that reason, it said.
US President Donald Trump signed a set of orders against the video platform during the summer.
One required ByteDance to sell its US TikTok operations within 90 days, citing national security concerns. The company also faced an order that would effectively ban the app from the country by the same date.
But on 30 October, a Pennsylvania judge issued an injunction temporarily blocking the order aimed at banning it. The order would have knocked the app offline by cutting it off from US businesses providing website hosting, data storage and other fundamentals needed to operate.
Trump has accused the popular video-sharing app of handing over American user data to Beijing – which the company flatly denies.

After negotiations with several US firms, ByteDance and TikTok proposed creating a new company with IT company Oracle as a technology partner and retail giant Walmart as a business partner.
The plan seemed to convince the administration, but the platform is still awaiting a green light.
TikTok said that with Thursday’s “deadline imminent and without an extension in hand, we have no choice but to file a petition in court to defend our rights and those of our more than 1,500 employees in the US.”
TikTok has over 200 million users in the US and Europe.

This week, we meet a 25-year-old Dubliner who loves her daily dog-walking routine, but wants to add some more vigorous exercise to her day.
Occupation: Admin 
Age: 25
Location: Dublin
Who you live with: My boyfriend and our dog
I’ve been working from home since March and, although it can be lonely at times, my introverted self loves it. I struggle with anxiety and depression, although they’re more under control now than they were even a year or two ago. I’ve noticed over the past few weeks that I really need to be doing more strenuous exercise, more so for my mind than for my body.
My dad lives alone so we’re in his social bubble, which I’m hugely thankful for. It breaks my heart to think of people who live alone and who have lost their social circle during the pandemic, and I’m so grateful that I can see my dad and spend time with him.
Daily activity levels: I try to go on a walk with my puppy at least twice a day, but I’ve come to realise that I need to do more strenuous exercise for both my mind and body. I’m determined to go for a run one of these days – but life keeps getting in the way.
Daily stress levels: I tend to get stressed about small things. I try to bring myself back down to earth and not stress out too much, but it’s quite hard when I’m in the middle of it. I started online therapy back in April and I think I would have been lost without it over the past few months. 
Eating/drinking habits: On the whole, I try to eat well as it greatly affects my mood and energy levels, though I depend on coffee to get me through the day sometimes. I’ve a sweet tooth and enjoy having a few drinks and a takeaway at the weekend, but come Monday morning I’m usually ready to start eating well again.
Sleep quality: I need at least eight hours a night. As much as I love to sleep, I have nightmares most nights and often wake up feeling drained.
Self-care: If I don’t take the time to unwind or spend some time to myself every once in a while, I really feel the effects. With working from home I’ve found it hard to switch off in the evenings and relax.
Tuesday
6.50am: I’m woken by the sound of someone knocking on my door and my puppy barking. Turns out it’s the maintenance man for our apartment complex, who’s come an hour early to drop off a dehumidifier.  Currently there’s mould in the hallway and damp in the bathroom, which this dehumidifier is supposed to help with.
It’s not the best way to be woken up, and I try to not let it set the tone for the rest of the day. Before work, I feed my puppy and play with her for a while. She has made the biggest difference to my mental health over the past few months – who else is always happy to see you, even if you’ve only been gone for five minutes?!
I sit down to my desk (which is the dining table, we don’t have room for an actual desk) and start work at 8am. I take my vitamins (iron, vitamin D and a probiotic) and have a coffee at around 8:30am. I have porridge, honey and granola for breakfast – the same every morning.
1pm: I finish my morning’s work (and reading everything I can about the US election) at 1pm and bring the dog on a walk along the seafront. I always get chatting to other dog owners on my afternoon walks and I really enjoy talking to them as it can be lonely working from home. My boyfriend works in an essential service, so he’s up and out early in the mornings. I spend my walk listening to and replying to voice notes from my friends. I usually have a few minutes towards the end of the walk where I walk along in silence and admire the trees and houses I’m passing. I think this is a form of mindfulness, right? I make myself a quick chicken sandwich and it’s back to work for the afternoon.
4pm: I started a master’s a few weeks ago, and I’m really enjoying it. I’ve a lecture for two hours until 6pm, so I make myself a quick cup of tea before I sit down. I’ve really enjoyed learning something new and having a new challenge. Everyone in the course is lovely and it feels great to be doing something to improve my skills. My boyfriend leaves a Crunchie and cup of tea of the table during my lecture, so I munch away on that.
6.30pm: After college, my boyfriend has dinner ready and we sit down to eat. He makes dinner most evenings as he finishes work earlier than me, and I must say it’s great to be able to sit down straight after work and have dinner instead of spending an hour on the bus. I really appreciate these moments when we sit down together at dinnertime, even if it’s only for 20 minutes.
After dinner I fly up to Tesco to do a quick food shop. I try to get in and out as soon as I can. On the way back, I drop a few things into my dad and have a cup of tea with him. I’m so grateful that he lives nearby, and try to see him as much as I can.
9.30pm: I get home, hop in the shower and get ready for bed. I watch TV with my boyfriend for a little while before we head to bed. I always try to make time to unwind in the evenings, even if it’s only for half an hour. I’m in bed and asleep by 10:30pm.
Wednesday
7.30am: I’m up a bit early for work again as I start at 8.30am today. My puppy was awake during the night crying with pain, so I booked her into the vet this evening. Otherwise it’s the same routine as usual. I’m always tired on Wednesdays after having college on Monday and Tuesday, so after not sleeping well last night, an extra strong coffee is needed this morning.
1pm: The morning goes by quickly and it’s time to go for a walk. Afterwards, I have lunch (soup and a sambo) and it’s back to work. I’m really trying to drink more water, but I can’t resist the call of another coffee. I’m glued to the election coverage and feel stressed about the vote count. What if Donald Trump catches up with Biden? The results seem hopeful so far, but I worry for my friends in the States – and the damage Trump could cause during the rest of his presidency.
5.30pm: I’m finished work and am rushing out the door to bring the dog to the vet. My boyfriend and I walk there in a hurry, and end up waiting 20 minutes anyway. It turns out that she has an ear infection, so we get her the medication she needs.
My boyfriend prepared dinner before we left, so he puts that on when we come home as I tidy around the apartment. It’s really important to me to keep the apartment looking nice as I spend so much time here. We sit down and have dinner, and catch up on the Great British Bake Off. I have a quick shower before bed, go on my phone for a little while and it’s lights out at around 11pm. I honestly don’t know where the day has gone.
Thursday
8am: You guessed it: feed and play with the dog, and start work at 9. I’ve been trying to keep a gratitude journal but keep forgetting, so I write a few things in that this morning. I’ve my usual coffee at 9.30am, and get stuck into work for the rest of the morning.
1pm: We’re out for our lunchtime walk and I decide to treat myself to a cake and a coffee. It’s a struggle trying to hold the lead, my coffee and my phone, then my puppy decides to go to the toilet and I’ve to figure out how to pick it up while holding everything else. Lovely. It’s a gorgeous day and I love looking at all of the different colours of the leaves on the trees, and take a moment to feel grateful for living so close to the sea. I quickly have a sandwich and soup before starting back work at 2pm.
6pm: I’ve dinner with my boyfriend and head out for a socially distant walk with my friend. We’ve been doing this for months now, pretty much from as soon as we were allowed to meet up with other people outdoors. It’s one of the only constants I have each week, and I love catching up with her. I nearly always feel tired and drained beforehand, but I feel so much better after we have a chat and a laugh. Having this agreement to go on a walk together every week has been great as neither of us ever cancel because we know how much it means to the other person.
8.30pm: After my walk, I sit down to do a couple of hours of college work. I really should have done some of this yesterday, but I didn’t get a chance after going to the vet. Although there’s a lot of reading and work to be done, I’m so happy I decided to do a Master’s this year. It has given me something to focus on and it feels good to know that I’m doing something to benefit my future self.
9pm: I think I’ve memorised all of the states in America at this stage and wish they’d announce the results for Nevada already.
10.30pm: I go straight to bed after finishing my college work, which isn’t a great idea as I can’t get my brain to switch off about the election. I scroll through my phone for a while before I eventually fall asleep.
Friday
8am: It’s Friday again – how did that happen?! I start work at 9am. I’m already dreaming of the takeaway I’m going to have later.
1pm: We head out for our lunchtime walk and I listen to a podcast about gratitude, which I keep zoning in and out of. It’s the thought that counts, right?

5.30pm: Work flew by today as there was lots to get done before the weekend, so I’m very glad when the end of the day rolls around. My boyfriend has gotten delayed in work so I do a quick clean of the apartment . I’m a bit of a clean freak and do a deep clean of the apartment every weekend, but it makes such a difference to my mood. I love sitting down at the weekend and seeing everything look fresh and tidy. My boyfriend gets home with treats and alcohol in hand (woohoo!) and we order a takeaway. I do some college work while we wait for the takeaway to arrive. I do a bit more work after we eat, then finally settle down to watch Netflix and have a few drinks. We watch more election coverage (it has been 253-214 forever) and I hope that we wake up to a result. I don’t have much to drink as I want to get up early tomorrow and get some college work done in the morning.
11pm: I’m absolutely exhausted and we head to bed, with the puppy snoring her head off at our feet.
Saturday
9am: My boyfriend is working today so he was up and gone at 7am. I’m not a morning person and could sleep in really late without an alarm, but alas, I’ve to do college work. I wonder if there’ll ever be a day in my life where I wake up feeling rested. There’s no result for the election yet, but it looks like we’ll know today. I go on a quick walk and buy a coffee on the way as motivation to get some work done.
12pm: I meet one of my friends for a walk along the seafront. I’m used to seeing her all the time and it’s been hard not seeing her so often during lockdown, but we’ve kept in contact through voice notes. We walk along the coast and get stopped multiple times thanks to the puppy – she’s a great way to get talking to people! The sea looks absolutely beautiful and I take another moment to be grateful for where we live. My friend and I buy a coffee and walk back along the coast before she heads home. It feels so good to catch up and have a laugh – my circle has been so small lately that I really appreciate meeting up with ‘new’ faces.
4pm: After leaving my friend, I get into the car and drive up to see my dad. He’s getting work done on the house so I help him to clear out a few of the rooms, and feel a bit sad that things are changing. I’m quite a sentimental person, but I try to remind myself that memories aren’t only connected to objects or material things.
7pm: I get home from my dad’s and neither my boyfriend nor I have the energy to make dinner, so we order another takeaway. I try not to feel bad and vow to eat better next week. In the end, I really enjoy the food and a few drinks. Drinking too much can hugely affect my mood the next day, so that’s always on the back of my mind.
The result of the election have finally come in by now and Biden is president-elect! I feel hugely emotional thinking about what this means for the future of the United States, and message my friends living there. We stay up to watch Biden’s speech and head to bed dreary-eyed around 2.30am.
Sunday
10am: I’m absolutely exhausted after staying up late last night and immediately make a large coffee. My boyfriend and I make a hearty brunch and catch up on the news while eating before I sit down to do a couple more hours’ college work.
2pm: We bring the dog on a walk and pick up some food for dinner on the way home. We’d planned to go for a long walk today, but we’re both happy to chill out and take it easy after a busy week. I sit down to do yet a few more hours’ college work while dinner is in the oven, and have a FaceTime call with some friends at 6pm. I haven’t caught up with these friends in ages, so I’m delighted to talk to them. I make a mental note to organise more video calls in future. I think it’s quite hard to keep in touch with people at the moment, but it’s more important than ever.
7pm: We sit down and have a delicious roast dinner and I take a moment to feel grateful for this little life we have here. I wasn’t happy for a very long time and grief has been a big part of my life, so I realise the importance of taking time to enjoy the little things.
8.30pm: One of my readings for college took much longer than expected, so it looks like I’ll be working away for the rest of the night. I follow my boyfriend to bed at 11pm.
Monday
8am: I didn’t sleep well at all last night and had quite a few nightmares, so I don’t feel good at all this morning. I’m quite stressed about the week ahead in work and make a large coffee, which definitely doesn’t help.
1pm: I’ve been feeling anxious all morning, but force myself to get out for a walk with the dog. I send a long voice note to a friend and feel a little bit better afterwards. I get stuck into work for the rest of the afternoon.
5:30pm: I’ve a quick dinner with my boyfriend before starting college at 6. I’ve been feeling dreadful all day and can’t really put my finger on why, and am hoping that college will take my mind off things.
8pm: I feel a bit better after college, and have a long shower to wash away the day. I have some more work to do for college tomorrow, so I spend a few hours getting that done. I didn’t get to sit down and watch TV with my boyfriend this evening, which is one of my favourite parts of my day, and I definitely feel the effects. I head to bed with a cup of tea at 11pm.
What I’ve learned this week…
I need to manage my schedule better when it comes to college work so I can leave time to unwind and switch off. I’ve also learned that some days I take on more than I have the capacity for, so I could benefit from learning to say ‘no’.
I really hate working late, which I did quite a bit this week. I think I’d benefit from getting up earlier and getting college work done in the mornings so I can relax in the evenings.
With the shorter days, it’s easy to stay indoors and watch Netflix in the evenings, although I know that going for a walk or run would make me feel better in the long run.

John Purcell, chair of the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland group, will tell committee members that the Covid-19 pandemic has created “severe threats” to broadcasters.
RTÉ and the Irish branch of the National Union of Journalists will also address the committee about the challenges faced by the media this year.
Media organisations have been struggling financially during the Covid-19 pandemic due to a dramatic fall in advertising spends that began during the first lockdown. 
As part of Budget 2021, the Future of Media Commission was set up to look into the future of media in Ireland. The Chair of the Commission will be Prof Brian MacCraith, former DCU President, and other  Alan Rusbridger, former editor-in-chief of The Guardian; Mark Little, founder of Storyful; and Siobhan Holliman, the deputy editor of the Tuam Herald.
Independent radio stations
The Independent Broadcasters of Ireland (IBI) represents radio stations such as 96FM, Beat 102-103, Q102, KFMRadio, Highland Radio, Radio Kerry, RedFM, SouthEastRadio, Tipp FM, and Northern Sound. 
IBI says that 70% of the Irish population, or 3.9 million people, listen to their stations on a daily basis, and that weekday figures of in excess of 2.5 million listeners.
In his opening statement, Purcell is expected to tell the Commiteee that although the MIBI welcomes the Future of Media Commission – to ensure the sustainability of media in a “rapidly changing landscape” – it can’t wait for the outcome.
Purcell understands that the Commission hearings, a report, the consideration of the report by the Committee and Oireachtas, the drafting, passing and implementation of legislation will not be completed until “at least the second half of 2022″.
“We cannot wait that long,” Purcell will tell the Committee.
You, the Government and the Minister cannot wait for the conclusion of the Commission on Media process to take action to ensure the survival of Irish broadcasting. If you do it will be too late for many.
A special €2.5 million fund was brought in for the broadcasting sector in the spring and summer to help deal with the financial shortfalls triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, but the IBI said these funds have ran out. 
NUJ propose 6% digital tax for  ’News Recovery Plan’
Séamus Dooley, the Irish Secretary of the National Union of Journalists, is also expected to tell the Committee that the pandemic has “exposed the fragile state of the Irish media”.
The present crisis has shown just how vital it is to have a news media providing accurate information, how enthusiastic people are for trustworthy content and how essential it is that the government and authorities are held to account.
Dooley said that the fragile state of the media was a consequence of “under-investment by media organisations in editorial resources and the paucity of action by successive governments to protect public-interest journalism”.
Among other measures, the NUJ is proposing a ’windfall tax’ of 6% on the tech giants, using the UK Digital Services Tax model, towards funding a ‘News Recovery Plan’.

The UK government committed to introducing a 2% Digital Services Tax from April on the revenues of large businesses providing internet search engines, social media
platforms and online marketplaces to UK users.
It’s also suggesting free vouchers for online or print subscriptions to over 70s and all 18-and-19-year-olds, as well as tax credits for households with subscriptions.
Director-General of RTÉ Dee Forbes is also due before the Oireachtas Commmitee today.
Forbes is expected to tell the committee of “a sharp drop in licence fee revenue and a decline in advertising revenue” as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Although that income has stabilised in the fourth quarter, Forbes is expected to say that the outlook for 2021 is uncertain due to Brexit and the scale of the economic recovery.

The Practitioner Health Matters Programme (PHMP), a service which provides confidential treatment for health workers with mental health or addiction issues, today released its 2019 annual report. 
The programme offers support and medical care to doctors, dentists and pharmacists dealing with issues like anxiety, stress and depression.
Our colleagues at Noteworthy want to investigate the measures being taken to tackle a pandemic-induced mental health crisis in Ireland. You can help fund them here.
The service said it dealt with 77 new presentations in 2019, a 3% increase on 2018. 
Dr Íde Delargy, medical director for the PHMP, said the programme expects a further rise in practitioners coming forward due to the increased mental health burden from Covid-19. 
“We have significant concerns about the impact of the virus on practitioners’ mental health, including anxiety, stress and depression,” Dr Delargy said. 
Last year saw the highest number of practitioners presenting to the programme, and we expect presentations to rise due to Covid-19 because health practitioners have never had to work under this kind of strain before.

“Everyone is working flat out to get through this pandemic, and it is only when the dust settles that people will properly be able to process what they have been through,” she said. 
Non-consultant hospital doctors, consultants and GPs accounted for almost three-quarters of new people coming forward to the service in 2019. 
Anxiety was the most common issue, affecting one-third of all presentations.
Burnout and stress impacted 14% of people and depression affected 13%.  
58 of the new presentations last year were aged between 26 and 49, and 13 were aged 50-64.

Although it is true that some face coverings are either sprayed with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or have a PTFE filter included, it does not cause these kinds of symptoms through normal everyday wear. 
These symptoms can be caused by a rare disease spurred on by PTFE being heated to a high temperature and emitting a fume. Mask wearing would not typically involve this, and PTFE on its own does not cause these symptoms. 
The claim 
This claim has been shared widely on Facebook in recent weeks. 
One Facebook post shared more than 140 times said: “Those blue masks that the stores are offering you and insisting you strap on when you enter …. did you know that they’re sprayed with PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) which is a synthetic fluoride found in teflon. Another nail in your coffin.”
Another post shared nearly 240 times said blue face masks are “sprayed with ptfe which is fluoride, carbon and Teflon and causes flu like symptoms”. 
The symptoms and circumstances described in these posts are referring to a relatively rare disease called polymer fume fever, known informally as Teflon flu.
This is a disease caused by the inhalation of products as a result of the thermal degradation of PTFE. This is the official term for Teflon, the brand name for a synthetic material used to coat cookware such as pots and pans to keep them non-stick.  
Essentially, if PTFE gets too hot it can produce products which cause rapid flu-like symptoms to develop if inhaled.
People with this disease show symptoms such as fever, shivering, sore throat and weakness. 
These are similar to the common symptoms of Covid-19 – fever, cough, shortness of breath and fatigue. 
A case report on one incident of a man who breathed in fumes from a smoking pan said the man’s symptoms of cough, fever and difficulty breathing were speculated as being triggered by the inhalation of fumes from the pan after it got too hot. 
The man had put a Teflon-coated pan on the stove top, fell asleep for five hours and awoke to find the pan scorched. 
The man took the burnt pan to the sink and ran it under the tap. This caused an explosive vapour to come off the surface of the pan. He inhaled this vapour and several hours later, began to show flu-like symptoms.  He went to the hospital and was treated with oxygen inhalation and his symptoms disappeared after three days. 
The study said inhalation of vapour from a scorched pan could lead to “influenza-type symptoms”. 
This gives an idea of what would be involved in order to experience these symptoms, and why wearing masks is unlikely to cause them. 
Masks
Most face masks, including blue surgical face masks, do not use PTFE. Surgical masks are most commonly made of a type of plastic called polypropylene. 
John Rice, the managing director of Irema, a company which produces medical face masks, responded to a query from TheJournal.ie about this issue.
“There is no spraying with PTFE in our masks and I have not heard of it with any other certified medical masks either,” Rice said. 
Medical face masks are made up of three layers – an inner layer, a filter layer and an outer layer. 
The inner layer is made of spunbond material, which is a fabric made in one continuous process. The white side of the mask, it is soft on the skin and has no filtration purposes. 
The second later is the filter layer. This is made of meltblown material which gives it good filtration properties. 
The outer layer, the side that is generally blue or another colour to indicate it is the outside, is also made of spunbond material. Similar to the inside, this has no filtration purposes. 
#OPEN JOURNALISM No news is bad news Support The Journal Your contributions will help us continue to deliver the stories that are important to you
SUPPORT US NOW
Rice said the middle filter layer is the “critical component” of the face mask. 
It is not a robust material, capable of being used on its own, hence the construction with an inner and outer layer to give it strength and functionality.  
There are some face masks available which are sprayed with PTFE or contain a PTFE filter layer.
But, as outlined earlier, this in itself does not cause flu-like symptoms – these occur only when the PTFE is heated, fumes are released and breathed in. 
There is no evidence that a person wearing a mask with a PTFE filter or coating in a normal manner would contract flu-like symptoms.

There is a lot of false news and scaremongering being spread in Ireland at the moment about coronavirus. Here are some practical ways for you to assess whether the messages that you’re seeing – especially on WhatsApp – are true or not.
STOP, THINK AND CHECK
Look at where it’s coming from. Is it someone you know? Do they have a source for the information (e.g. the HSE website) or are they just saying that the information comes from someone they know? A lot of the false news being spread right now is from people claiming that messages from ‘a friend’ of theirs. Have a look yourself – do a quick Google search and see if the information is being reported elsewhere. 
Secondly, get the whole story, not just a headline. A lot of these messages have got vague information (“all the doctors at this hospital are panicking”) and don’t mention specific details. This is often – but not always a sign – that it may not be accurate. 
Finally, see how you feel after reading it. A lot of these false messages are designed to make people feel panicked. They’re deliberately manipulating your feelings to make you more likely to share it. If you feel panicked after reading something, check it out and see if it really is true.

Over the next 12 months, the charity plans to deliver over 210 social housing units via construction, leasing, re-use of empty buildings and acquisition.
Construction projects will deliver new social housing units in locations including Dublin, Limerick, and Kildare with over 70% of those units due to be one-bedroom apartments.
It comes as the charity published its annual report for 2019 at a new construction project on Haddington Road, Dublin 4 where Peter McVerry Trust will deliver 18 new social housing units.
Pat Doyle, CEO of Peter McVerry Trust, said: “Last year was very busy for us, with many key developments within the organisation.
“Among those was the significant expansion of our Housing First work as we secured new contracts in Dublin, the Midlands, the Mid-East and the North East regions which will see us delivering 61% of the national Housing First programme.”
“Launching our report here today at this construction site on Haddington Road ties in with our goal to grow and expand our Housing First work.
This development will deliver 18 one-bedroom homes and will enable us to provide more homes for people targeted by Housing First as well as others in homelessness and leaving State care.
“The single biggest barrier facing the roll-out of Housing First is the lack of available one-bedroom homes across our cities and towns. That is why we are trying to play a more active role in supplying those homes directly with funding from the local authorities and the Department of Housing.”

Peter McVerry Trust’s annual report shows that the charity was active across 21 local authorities at the end of 2019. The report also shows that the charity worked with 6,184 people across Ireland last year.
The report also covers key areas of Peter McVerry Trust’s services, including its Housing First work across 11 counties as well as the charity’s new second-level specialist Learning Centres in Dublin.
“We want to ensure we create high-quality homes that are sustainable in both design and location. Our goal is to deliver several small scale projects, scattered across cities and large towns, to avoid large concentration in any one community,” Doyle said.

Parcel volumes have “peaked beyond Christmas volumes” but An Post stressed that “everything is under control” as it moves through the busy period.
The move to Level 5 almost three weeks ago meant that non-essential retailers had to shut their doors. They are set to remain closed until 1 December at the earliest.
And, ahead of the busy Christmas period, online sales are booming. An Post has faced a slew of queries on social media regarding the status of parcels, with customers saying they’re facing delays receiving them. The company says it has been handling a huge volume of parcels in recent weeks.
A spokesperson for An Post told TheJournal.ie: “Covid-19 has accelerated the move to online shopping on top of which there is a huge early rush on Christmas shopping and a move to purchasing everyday essentials online due to the Level 5 retail restrictions.”
The company said that from the retailers themselves dispatching items, to processing items and to eventually delivering them is all taking slightly longer this year. It said this is being felt by all carriers including An Post.
As well as the large volume, public health guidelines such as social distancing mean that extra measures have to be taken in postal depots to ensure the safety of employees. The company said that the current delays are due to the sheer number of post it’s processing, and is not being caused by any staff absent due to Covid-19.
Its commerce MD Garrett Bridgeman said: “There has never been parcel volumes like this, up 130% on the same time last year – a total of 8 million items a week between letters and parcels.
Due to a huge spike in volumes and ensuring the safety of our staff, everything takes longer. It’s taking retailers longer to despatch, and it’s taking longer  to process items and longer to get out on delivery so  we are asking customers for their patience. We will deliver your parcels. Please bear with us as we’re working around the clock to sort and deliver. We’re out delivering in the evenings and at weekends too.

An Post said there had been a large increase in Irish retailers trading online and this was creating its own logistical challenges.
The company added the opening of a new automated parcel centre in the coming weeks in Dublin will help to relieve the pressure heading into December.
Bridgeman said: “To ensure the safety of staff, we are working with staggered start times,  socially distanced work-spaces and in accordance with all guidelines.
We’re seeing a mobilisation of An Post’s workforce like never before and we assure customers that we will get your parcels to you, just please, be patient.  If you normally get your items next day it may take 2 -3 days to get your parcel.

Rita Ryan (69) was in her early twenties and working as a care assistant, when she first began to abuse the child after calling into her bedroom at night-time and asking her if she knew “what French kissing was”.
The abuse continued and escalated in severity to include mutual masturbation and oral sex.
The now 60-year-old victim, who lives abroad, made a statement to gardaí in 2014.
Ryan was questioned in October 2016 and said she didn’t think her behaviour amounted to sexual abuse.
She accepted a suggestion by the gardaí that it was instead “a romantic relationship” and acknowledged that it was also “an intimate relationship”.
Ryan of Meadowview Grove, Hillcrest, Lucan, Dublin pleaded guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to two charges of indecent assault of the girl at the orphanage in Dublin on dates between December 1971 until October 1974.
The abuse came to an end when the victim left Ireland to live with her mother abroad.
Dean Kelly SC, prosecuting, told the court that the pleas were acceptable to the State on the basis that they represent sample charges.
He said the victim later told gardaí that Ryan would abuse her “frequently” and “whenever the opportunity arose”.
Counsel said the maximum penalty available to the court, due to the law that existed at the time, is two years.
He confirmed that had the same abuse occurred today, Ryan would instead be facing a maximum sentence of 14 years, due to a change in legislation.
Suspended in full
Today, Judge Martin Nolan sentenced Ryan to a two-year term which he suspended in full, having heard the evidence yesterday and adjourned the case overnight to consider it.
He noted that Ryan had €15,000 in court to offer the victim as a token of remorse and said she must have a further €15,000 for the victim within a year.
He estimated that Ryan had abused the child more than a hundred times and said that Ryan was an adult at the time in a position of trust.
“I have come to the conclusion that she knew what she was doing and to engage in such activities with a child is reprehensible,” the judge said.
He also made reference to the “disparity of age” between them.
The judge noted that a victim impact statement, which was not read out in court, outlined that the woman has been greatly traumatised by the abuse and it has impacted her life. He described the woman as “a great lady”.
He also accepted that a psychologist report gave insight into Ryan’s own background and sexual experience and accepted that she is “highly unlikely to re-offend to any degree in the future”.
Absence of criminal record
The judge took into account Ryan’s admissions, absence of a criminal record, the fact that she has led a productive life, is invaluable to her extended family and has contributed to her local community.

He said what “troubled the court” was “the prolonged nature of the behaviour” and described it as a “particularly important factor” in determining whether Ryan would go to jail or not.
He said he had decided the issue of custody separate to the €15,000 offered as a token of Ryan’s remorse.
“Let nobody say or believe she is buying her way out of prison. That is not the situation. I decide the issue of prison or not independent of any money proffered,” he added.
He addressed Ryan directly and said “what you did was shameful. It is a very long time ago but that doesn’t make it any less shameful”.
Seamus Clarke SC, defending, said his client has a number of children and is now a grandmother.
Detective Garda Brian Davoren accepted that her pleas of guilty saved the victim a trial.
He also acknowledged that she had €15,000 in court to offer the women as “a token of her remorse”.
He acknowledged that the victim and Ryan stayed in touch over the years and the victim visited Ryan on a number of occasions, including in 2010.
Counsel told the court that his client grew up on a farm in Limerick before being awarded a scholarship to attend boarding school.
He said she “regrets deeply what she has done” and handed in a large number of letters, including ones from herself and her family. He said she has given care to people in her local community.

FROM MIDNIGHT 29 November, travellers arriving into Ireland from so-called ‘red’ regions in the EU will be allowed to move freely once they pass a PCR Covid-19 test five days following their arrival.
This provision will also be available to arrivals from orange regions who may not have availed of a pre-departure test. 
In a move that will have major implications for Christmas aviation travel, grey areas on EU traffic light map for international travel – such as the United States – are classed as red regions.
Currently, a person is advised to restrict their movements for 14 days following arrival from a ‘red’ region.
Cabinet agreed the change to the rules today which will also impact passengers arriving from orange regions.
As of last Sunday night, travellers arriving from orange regions do not have to restrict their movements if they carry a negative Covid-19 test taken at least three days previous.
However, from 29 November, those who do not have a negative test upon arrival in Ireland, can have a test taken five days later.
Passengers will be asked to restrict their movements until they get the test.
Under the new EU traffic light plan, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control publish a weekly map of the EU using a three-stage colour system to indicate the level of risk in each area.
Levels will be determined by a variety of epidemiological factors including the 14-day incidence per 100,000 population and the level of positive tests.

Ireland has agreed to align to the plan which is based on regions rather than countries.
In a statement, Aer Lingus said it welcomed the revisions to the testing regime and said the adoption of the traffic light system “will enable customers to book with confidence in 2021″. 
Planning permission exemption
In addition, Cabinet also agreed that the Dublin Airport Authority will be granted a planning permission exemption to allow it to set up Covid-19 testing on site at the airport.
In terms of a testing regime in Ireland, Transport Minister Eamon Ryan has said the government wants to make sure that such a system does not impede on HSE capacity.
He told an Oireachtas committee last week that he is confident such a testing regime could be “done quite quickly”.
He said the government has been engaging with the DAA which has engaged with about 20 providers that can supply Covid-19 tests.
Ryan said he expects the private sector to provide the tests.

Private testers must notify the HSE of positive Covid-19 tests under the new rules.
The new ECDC map was published on Thursday.
Regions currently listed as orange include Norway, Finland, and areas in Greece. vOnly Greenland is categorised as a green region as of 5 November.
NPHET’s position is that the risks associated with international travel are “very, very high”.
The Department of Foreign Affairs, which sets government policy on travel, states that Ireland is implementing the new traffic light approach to travel, which applies to countries in the EU and UK.
If you are considering travelling outside of Ireland, the Department of Foreign Affairs says it continues to advise against non-essential travel overseas, other than to countries that are part of the EU ‘traffic lights’ approach, where the advice is to exercise a high degree of caution – this includes Great Britain but not Northern Ireland. 
In a government statement this evening, it states that, subject to ongoing review of testing by NPHET and Government, a negative result from a Covid-19 PCR test is the only test result that means the passenger is not expected to follow advice to restrict movements.
Testing technology and delivery options for facilitating international travel will be kept under review, it adds.
Testing provision under Ireland’s framework for international travel will not be provided through the public health system, but rather will be met by the private commercial sector testing supply on a user pays basis.

As the availability of testing cannot be guaranteed intending passengers wishing to avail of a test should seek an early appointment for a test in advance of travel, said the government statement.
It remains a mandatory requirement for arrivals to Ireland (excluding essential workers) to correctly complete a Passenger Locator Form.
Airlines’ reaction
Aer Lingus said in a statement that “these changes represent positive steps towards facilitating increased safe international travel, which is critical to the Irish economy”.
It added: “While noting that the government has initially established a PCR testing solution for post arrival testing, Aer Lingus believes that going forward tests should be based on a rapid and affordable testing solution. 
Aer Lingus believes that a rapid antigen testing regime is the most appropriate standard in this regard. Only a rapid and affordable testing solution will facilitate a meaningful increase in safe international travel.

VERA PAUW IS adamant that the Republic of Ireland’s prospects of qualifying for the European Championships are not yet dead, despite seeing her side suffer an enormous setback last month.
A 1-0 defeat away to Ukraine has left Ireland facing a daunting prospect if they’re to remain on track to reach a first major tournament via the play-offs.
When they conclude their Group I campaign with a game against Germany at Tallaght Stadium on 1 December, the Girls in Green must match or better Ukraine’s result at home to Montenegro on the same day.
Given that Montenegro have lost all seven of their games to date, conceding 26 goals and scoring just one, the likelihood is that Ireland will need to beat a Germany side who are currently ranked second in the world.
The Germans, who were 3-0 winners against Ireland in Essen in September, boast a remarkable record in qualifying matches, having lost just one in the past two decades.
“We are realistic because we have already played against Germany,” Pauw said today after announcing a provisional 31-strong squad which will be trimmed before the players assemble on 22 November.
“But these players are Irish and Irish players go for everything. The finishing line is after 90 minutes, plus injury-time, and then we will see. But we will prepare for a win, of course, and that starts with not losing. It has to be a win. A draw is not enough.”

Qualification may ultimately prove to be out of reach once more, but Pauw believes that Ireland continue to make progress. Nevertheless, there have been costly errors during their bid to reach the Euros, which will be held in England in July 2022.
A stoppage-time equaliser scored by Greece last November deprived Ireland of two points, while the loss in Ukraine was also a missed opportunity. A defensive mix-up between Aine O’Gorman and Courtney Brosnan gifted the hosts the decisive goal in Kiev, before Katie McCabe rattled the crossbar with a penalty.
The Ireland boss said: “We are striding forward. We are doing at this moment so well. I have written a letter to the players and staff, in which I highlighted what has happened in our campaign.

“If you look at it, apart from Germany, we did not concede one single goal from an attack of our opponent. They were mistakes from us and we need to learn from that.
“We have grown so fast. The message is that we have a chance to succeed, it is in our hands if we play like we can play, even if the chances are slim.
“We have taken a step forward in every game, even though there is hardly any chance to train. In taking those steps forward, we have confidence that we can surprise.
“We will do everything in our power to get a result against Germany and the players are ready. They don’t want to give up either in any single moment until that last finishing line.”

In the aftermath of Ukraine’s recent win over Greece, which further dented Ireland’s hopes of securing second place and a guaranteed play-off spot, Pauw sought to inspire her players with a reminder of a memorable victory for the Irish men’s team against Germany.
Against the odds at the Aviva Stadium in October 2015, Shane Long scored an unlikely winner against the Germans – who were then the reigning world champions – to help the Boys in Green qualify for the following summer’s European Championships.
“I sent that goal from the famous 2015 game immediately after the Ukraine game against Greece to the players,” Pauw said. “It is possible and Ireland have shown it before, so why would we not be able to get a night like that for ourselves?
“We will do everything to get there and we’ll see after the game whether it’s realistic or not. We know the strength of Germany, we know that the chances are slim, but we will go for it 100%.”
Meanwhile, Manchester City defender Megan Campbell could soon be back in action after encountering a stumbling block in her efforts to return. A serious ankle injury has sidelined her since January.
“She had a setback in her recovery,” Pauw said of the 27-year-old Drogheda native. “She’s getting back to training – actually today is her first session on the pitch with the [Manchester City] team again.
“We follow her closely and have close contact with her coach. That’s a very good thing, a very positive contact, and we will continue to follow her. We had hoped for her to be ready in October but that unfortunately was not the case.”","The Girls in Green will host the Germans on 1 December.",1,0,0,28512,"Nov 10th 2020, 4:30 PM"
907,193,"Biden says it's an 'embarassment' that Trump hasn't conceded yet",https://www.thejournal.ie/mike-pompeo-biden-trump-5262609-Nov2020/,"US PRESIDENT-ELECT Joe Biden has said that Donald Trump’s refusal to concede the US election was an “embarrassment” that will reflect poorly on his legacy.
“I just think it’s an embarrassment, quite frankly,” Biden said when asked what he thinks about Trump’s refusal to acknowledge defeat in the election.
“How can I say this tactfully,” Biden told reporters in his home town of Wilmington, Delaware. “I think it will not help the president’s legacy.”
When asked what he would say to Trump, given the chance, Biden replied: “Mr President, look forward to speaking with you.”
But the Democratic president-elect downplayed the impact of Trump’s refusal to assist with the transition toward a new US administration.
“The fact that they’re not willing to acknowledge we won at this point is not of much consequence in our planning,” Biden said, looking ahead to his inauguration.
“I think at the end of the day, it’s all going to come to fruition on January 20th, and between now and then, my hope and expectation is that the American people do know, and do understand that there has been a transition.”
World leaders including almost all US allies have congratulated Biden, who has achieved unassailable leads in key states as well as a commanding edge in the nationwide popular vote. Today, he has spoken to leaders including Taoiseach Micheál Martin.
But Trump has refused to concede the 3 November election and has alleged massive fraud, calling for recounts and legal action.
Earlier, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has promised the world a “smooth transition” after US elections but refused to recognise President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, saying Donald Trump will remain in power.

“There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,” Pompeo said in an at times testy news conference when asked about contacts with the Biden team.
“The world should have every confidence that the transition necessary to make sure that the State Department is functional today… with the president who is in office on January 20 a minute after noon will be successful,” he said, referring to the date of the presidential inauguration.
Asked if the United States can still issue statements calling for free elections around the world, Pompeo said the question was “ridiculous.”

“This department cares deeply to make sure that elections around the world are safe and secure and free and fair, and my officers risk their lives to ensure that that happens,” he said.
Earlier today, both Taoiseach Micheál Martin and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson had phone calls with the president-elect.
Martin said he congratulated Biden “on the historic nature of his election” and that of Vice President Elect Kamala Harris.
“We agreed to work closely together,” said the Taoiseach.
Government sources here have described the call as “very personal”. The two leaders discussed many issues, such as Brexit and the border with Northern Ireland.
Biden is understood to have told the Taoiseach that he is determined to sign back up to the Paris Accord.
Downing Street, meanwhile, said that Johnson discussed trade with Biden, as he seeks to negotiate a post-Brexit deal with Washington.
And they were said to have discussed Nato, which Trump routinely railed against during his single term as president, which continues into January.

Outside was a police line: cars, makeshift fences and a few hundred riot officers in balaclavas with shields. It was clear that attempting to push through would result in bloody clashes. Again, advice flashed up in the Nexta Telegram feed. “Minsk! Do not approach the police line! The best decision now is to disperse.” The crowd did just that.

EXECUTIVE MINISTERS WERE involved in angry exchanges after the DUP moved to block a proposal to extend Northern Ireland’s circuit-break lockdown for two more weeks.
DUP Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots’ call for the proposal to be decided using the cross-community voting mechanism – effectively handing his party a veto – provoked heated responses from other parties during a meeting on Tuesday night.
The recommendation to extend the circuit-break measures in their entirety was tabled by Health Minister Robin Swann, who warned of another spike in cases by mid-December if the move was not taken.
The DUP has been opposed to extending the full complement of restrictions beyond the original four-week period.
After Swann’s paper was voted down, ministers turned to debating alternative proposals tabled by DUP Economy Minister Diane Dodds. Dodds has recommended a partial reopening of the hospitality sector.
Executive exchanges are ongoing tonight, with chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride and chief scientific adviser professor Ian Young outlining the implications of Mrs Dodds’ proposals.
The meeting convened around 6pm, almost 24 hours after exchanges broke up on Monday without agreement.
Ministers are at odds on whether to extend, amend or relax the current four-week circuit-break measures, which expire at midnight on Thursday.
The circuit-break has forced the closure of much of the hospitality sector in Northern Ireland and halted the work of close contact services such as hairdressing.
The PA news agency understands that measures in Dodds’ alternative paper include:
– Close contact services, including driving lessons, can resume on November 13 by appointment only.
– Unlicensed premises, including cafes and coffee shops, can reopen on November 13.
– Hotels able to serve food and alcohol to residents.
– Licensed premises remain closed until November 27. “Safely open” group, involving hospitality sector and executive, to be established to oversee this move.
– Pubs and bars able to offer sealed off-sales from November 13.
A further 11 Covid-19 linked deaths were announced in Northern Ireland today, along with 514 new confirmed cases.
This morning, First Minister Arlene Foster expressed confidence the executive could find a consensus position.
She told the Assembly there was a need to develop a “clear exit strategy” from lockdown measures.

“I do not believe that we can continually go into circuit-breakers, lockdowns, call them what you will,” she said.
“You cannot keep turning on and off the economy.
“When you go back on one occasion there’ll be nothing left and people will not have jobs, they will not be able to support their families, they will fall into destitution and poverty, and that in and of itself has its own health outcomes – mental health and, as I say, the issues around poverty.
“So there is a need for us to find a way forward. I hope that we can all work in collaboration to find a way forward.”
Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard said his party supported the resumption of close contact services but believed the restrictions on the hospitality sector should be extended.
Hazzard said it would be reckless to throw away progress in reducing infection rates.
“I think there is a case to be made when it comes to close contact services, you could look at relaxations,” he told BBC Radio Ulster.
“But I think on the whole it’s important we find a way forward now that sees us through to the new year and, to me, that means restrictions must stay in place for another two weeks.”","Ministers are meeting again tonight after discussions yesterday failed to secure a breakthrough.",1,0,0,26608,"Nov 10th 2020, 1:49 PM"

912,183,"Government wins confidence motion in Tánaiste Leo Varadkar following testy Dáil debate",https://www.thejournal.ie/motion-confidence-varadkar-5262532-Nov2020/,"Updated Nov 10th 2020, 7:48 PM
A DÁIL CONFIDENCE motion in Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has been won by the government.
The final vote was 92 to 65 in favour of the government. 
Sinn Féin tabled the motion of no confidence in Varadkar last Friday after the revelation that he had sent a copy of an agreement between the government and the Irish Medical Organisation to a rival GP group while he was taoiseach last year.
Varadkar faced questions in the Dáil last Tuesday over the revelations, which were first published by Village Magazine.
Overriding Sinn Féin’s no confidence motion in Varadkar, the government tabled a confidence motion that was proposed by Taoiseach Micheál Martin this evening. 
The debate began at about 5.40pm and lasted for just under two hours.  
During the debate, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said Varadkar “must be held accountable” for his actions while government colleagues mounted a robust defence of the Tánaiste.
Martin said that Varadkar had “acknowledged his error” and that “all details have been published lessons have been learned around”. 
Martin also said that the Tánaiste was part of a government of which “tackling the pandemic remains our first priority”. 
“I’m happy to propose a motion of confidence in the Tánaiste Leo Varadkar, who was part of a coalition government which is implementing an urgent and progressive programme to help and work all sections of our society,” Martin said. 
The Taoiseach also criticised Sinn Féin for what he said was engaging in “politics as usual.”
“Sinn Féin is entitled to practice the politics of always looking for an angle, and both participating in and attacking a government at the same time,” he said.
I see no purpose in using my time in this debate to address the ever-rising examples of Sinn Féin ignoring basic ethical standards. True republicanism is about working in the interests of all of the people. 
Criticising Varadkar’s actions, McDonald said the government was “playing by the rulebook of the old boys’ network”.
“The cozy club insider culture that dominates Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil too is why those parties failed workers and families again and again,” she said. 
Leo Varadkar while he was Taoiseach leaked confidential government information to his friend. He can offer no credible reason for his actions. His claim that he was acting in the interests of the taxpayer or that the information was already in the public domain are threadbare.
Sinn Féin’s Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty said that Varadkar was “caught red handed” and passed on a confidential document.
Both Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney and Social Protection Minister Heather Humphreys also defended Varadkar and criticised Sinn Féin.

Leo Varadkar apologises for 'errors of judgement', says he is 'not close friends' with Dr Ó Tuathail
Coveney said that “faceless online trolls” have suggested that Varadkar was engaged in “personal gain or to sabotage instead of landing widespread support for a deal done with GPs”.
“Last week was about accountability to this house, and rightly so. But what is Sinn Féin’s game here this evening?,” Coveney said.
Are they using this issue to try to sow division in a coalition during a global pandemic and as Brexit negotiations reach endgame, simply to harvest or nurture online hate and bile.
Humphreys said: 
You pontificate about a golden circle, when Sinn Féin is the richest party in this country. You even had Donald Trump himself at one of your gold plated dinners in America. You had the gall to accuse this government of burying records, but victims of the IRA across this country are still buried and their families are still waiting. 
Labour’s Aodhán Ó Ríordáin and the Social Democrats’ Róisín Shortall both said that they would not be supporting Varadkar. 
“The Labour Party told the Tánaiste to come clean, to tell the truth, to dispense with the incredible yarn he had been peddling, to apologise and perhaps there may have been a way out for him. But the minister chose not to do that,” Ó Ríordáin said. 
The Dublin Bay North TD also criticised Sinn Féin, saying: 
Sinn Féin want to present themselves as the ethical left. They say they want to stand against insider politics and the old boys club. We in the Labour Party offer them some advice. It’s not good enough to describe a convicted tax cheat as a good Republican, because he’s a member of your old boys club.
Shortall outlined seven reasons why she would not be supporting Varadkar, the final of which she outlined: 
What added insult to injury for the public was that as leader of Fine Gael he required his Cabinet colleagues to demean themselves by parroting the cynically crafted spin lines, repeating his false narrative across the airwaves.
“The Tánaiste’s actions in respect of this sordid affair were unworthy of his office,” she said. 
Speaking about why he was voting in Varadkar’s favour despite earlier criticising him, Fianna Fáil TD Marc MacSharry said: “I stand by my comments of last week on RTÉ. Like de Valera’s relationship with the oath of allegiance, tonight’s vote is an empty formula but a necessary one at this time.”

Closing the debate, Varadkar himself apologised over his leaking of the document but also went on the attack against Sinn Féin.
Varadkar said this was the first time that he had faced a motion of no-confidence and it had caused him to “reflect” on his actions.
He accused Sinn Fein of tabling the motion to “keep the story in the public eye for another week” and to “distract from other issues”. He claimed the “truth” was that for Sinn Fein politics was “just a game”.

IN BINT JBEIL in Southern Lebanon, Captain Kate O’Flynn leads a military cell of Irish and Polish personnel who engage with local communities, not far from where UN troops patrol the border between south Lebanon and Israel. 
In 1982 during the Lebanon Civil War, Israeli troops invaded Lebanon for the second time in a decade and aided Lebanese Christian militias in seizing large parts of Lebanon, including Beirut. Though they withdrew from some parts in the years that followed, the South Lebanon Security Belt – a border region – remained occupied by these forces for 18 years until Israel withdrew its troops in 2000. 
UN troops still patrol roughly along the Israeli-Lebanese border, and that patrol is referred to as the ‘Blue Line’.
“It’s away from the coast, in more arduous terrain,” O’Flynn says of where she and her battalion are stationed. 
“A lot of population in South Lebanon actually commute to Beirut and return at the weekends, but since the Beirut explosion there has been a knock-on effect and a dampening of their spirits. A lot of them have returned to their local villages.”
TheJournal.ie had an opportunity to speak to O’Flynn as part of a look at the 20 years since the UN launched its ‘Women, Peace and Security’ agenda (WPS).
The UN agenda aims to lessen the effects of war and conflict on women and girls through putting women at the forefront of peacekeeping missions – we spoke to O’Flynn and the Irish chair of Ireland’s WPS Oversight Group to see what difference it has made in the past two decades. 
Captain Kate O'Flynn.

The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) was established to confirm the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon, and restore peace and security in the area.
In 2006, war broke out between Israel and Lebanon: the Lebanese government deployed 15,000 of its own troops to the south, and UNIFIL expanded its mandate – it now has around 10,500 peacekeepers from 45 countries in the area. 
There is a total of 336 Irish personnel deployed to UNIFIL on this rotation. The Irish troops are deployed with contingents from the Polish, Hungarian and Maltese militaries, collectively referred to as ‘IrishPolBatt’.
O’Flynn’s battalion is a civil military cooperation cell, nicknamed  ’Cimic’. 
Although all Defence Force personnel on peacekeeping missions are given training on engaging with local communities in areas of conflict, this cell is unique in how this is its main focus – although it also supports the Blue Line patrol.
Since the 116 Battalion arrived in June, O’Flynn says they have supported “quick impact projects to help strengthen the self-sustainability” of the people of South Lebanon – such as equipment for locals who have returned to agriculture since the economic downturn, which has been made worse again by the Covid-19 pandemic.
O’Flynn says: “We sponsored agriculture equipment for the pressing of olives and the milling of wheat.”
Other projects include installing street lighting, water purification, solar panels and a beekeeping initiative (O’Flynn says Irish organisations have been asked for equipment to help the local Lebanese beekeepers). 
When asked about what difference a female captain has, or other female military personnel have on the women and girls in that area, O’Flynn says that seeing women in UN patrols, female firefighters, female translators, and having female medics available – which make healthcare easier to access for women in the area – all have an influence.
“We actually have a male dental nurse, something that they probably wouldn’t normally see in South Lebanon, but it just kind of breaks down that gender norm again.”
She also mentions a specific initiative that is focused on helping women return to work, thought up by working with a local mayor, who O’Flynn calls “an incredibly progressive individual”, and his female secretary. 
“She has an incredible knowledge,” O’Flynn says. “They’ve set up a place to sell local produce for the winter months – herbs, spices, tomato sauces, wheat, olives. It’s a lovely place to walk into.
But they solely employ females, so it’s a great means of encouraging females to return to the workplace, and this is a project we’ve really been heavily involved in.

Another example of progress is making self-defence classes available to women, said O’Flynn.
“Previously self-defence classes were only for males. But in the last number of years, we’ve been approaching mayors – or the head of the town or village – and asking ‘Would this be open to women?’ A lot of them have been very approachable and have welcomed self-defence classes for women in their society.”
Sometimes we have to have just women with women, and it works. We always have a workaround and we respect their cultural beliefs.
O’Flynn says that she has seen examples of gender-based violence during their tour.

She found that when she went through the process to help protect these individuals, “there are a lot of systems in place”, like safe houses and aid organisations. She added that awareness of gender-based violence in Lebanon “is on the increase”. 
The battalion’s tour ends after six months, meaning O’Flynn and her team leave at the end of November and are replaced.
Chair of Ireland’s WPS: Nora Owen
When the United Nations set up the Women, Peace and Security programme 20 years ago, its aim was to try to alleviate the effects conflict and war have on women and girls, acknowledging that they are affected differently by these issues than males.
Gender and sexual-based violence, as well as sexual slavery, are among the most severe disproportionate effects war has on women.
But in areas where women have a secondary place in society beforehand, during and after a conflict those issues are exacerbated: their access to healthcare can be limited, and they’re affected more by displacement. 
Ireland’s Oversight Group on the WPS agenda has published three Action Plans to implement these peacekeeping aims.

“There are women suffering hugely in conflict-resolution situations, and it’s not really recognised as much as it should be. And it’s certainly not recognised by the leaders of some of those countries.”
Owen says she has always been interested in development aid – in the 1980s, then-Taoiseach Garret Fitzgerald appointed her as chair of a committee on developing countries, and she joined the board of Trócaire after losing her Dáil seat in 1987. In 2003 she joined the board of Concern.
Owen says that although the agenda is mostly about areas of conflict and post conflict, it was also important that problems disproportionately affecting women in Ireland, such as Direct Provision, must be addressed before Ireland looks at issues in other countries.
When I took over for the second [Action Plan] it coincided with a growth in more migrants seeking asylum and to be minded here. And so I felt as a Group, we had to take that issue on board, because whatever about telling other countries how they deal with conflict, we had now a set of people who needed to be cared for in Ireland. 
She said that the group has raised issues faced by women in Direct Provision with the Department of Justice. When asked what these were, Owen said that the Department of Justice were already looking at issues of forced marriages and domestic violence in DP centres.

“I sent several letters to the Department, to the HSE, to the Department of Justice, to the Department of Education – we tried to stimulate across government the recognition that Women Peace and Security involved them – it wasn’t just Foreign Affairs.”
She said that things have improved in Direct Provision centres, but adds “it’s not right yet”.
“My role was to make sure we here in Ireland are delivering by making sure that there weren’t people in our country that are not being taken care of,” adding that the Group would keep “a watchful eye” on what happens in Direct Provision centres.
Owen says that achieving peace in Northern Ireland is a template and an example that is valuable for other areas of conflict around the world, and cites that the Northern Ireland Women’s Coalition and its founder Monica McWilliams “was very involved” in the Peace Process and the Good Friday Agreement negotiations.
I think where the pressure has to come on, is on leaders of countries where there’s conflict – they must recognise that if they want to have a Good Friday Agreement-type peace agreement, then they must involve the women of their country in that. They can’t just keep ignoring those needs.
Owen is quite frank on the limits of the WPS agenda, too. On Lebanon, for example, there is no minimum age for marriage, and – as was written about here as part of TheJournal.ie-Simon Cumbers series of articles on Lebanon – it has a serious impact on women. 
Replied Owen: “The problem is there are a lot of traditional actions in many countries that are very definitely ones that we would not allow – like multiple marriages, and early child marriage. 
“I remember being in Botswana many years ago and a hearing two men talking about their brother who had died, and one of them was saying ‘Well I’m taking the wife, she’s coming to me’.
“And I was appalled and I said ‘What do you mean?’ and he said ‘Oh yes that’s what we do here, we take over, and she becomes another wife to me whether she wants or not’. Religious leaders need to be involved in recognising that the world has moved on from a lot of these traditions.”
But the only way you can make those changes is not interfering, but participating in roundtable discussions where people are sitting down – even with countries that you and I mightn’t want to.
At the end of the day, if they’re not talking, they’re not making the changes that are necessary. You find a format that you can talk to people without lecturing them: ‘We had to make these changes in our country – we usen’t to allow women to go back to work in the civil service after they got married – we changed that law now.’ You use your own experience to try and move people on in their lives.","The United Nations’ Women Peace and Security agenda is 20 years old.

Delaney has sought to inspect 280,000 documents, covering a period of 17 years, which were seized by the ODCE from the FAI’s offices last February as part of its investigation into Irish soccer’s governing body.
The court has been asked by the ODCE to determine if some files are covered by legal professional privilege and cannot be used by the corporate watchdog as part of its probe.
Delaney has been allowed to inspect the files, including thousands of emails, to see which are private to him or covered by professional legal privilege.
The matter first came before the courts last February.
While a timetable for the completion of the inspection was agreed, lawyers for the UK-based former FAI Chief Executive sought extra time to complete the inspection.
The extension was needed due to the large volume of material, it was argued.
In a series of motions before the court, Delaney, represented by Paul McGarry SC, sought more time in order to complete the inspection.
The extension would be aided by the ODCE allowing his lawyers to apply additional search terms to help identify more files so they can be inspected.
The court was also asked to extend the completion date to mid-January 2021.
Counsel said that a lot of work had already been done by Delaney’s side, and that number of the 3,000 files previously ‘tagged’ by Delaney’s lawyers as being covered by professional legal privilege had been reduced.
Counsel also said that if Delaney was not able to inspect all of the files before any designated completion date set by the court, then he would have claim professional legal privilege on all of the outstanding material.
It was said that this could lead to more work for those involved in the entire process, and that Delaney was not dragging his feet or trying to delay the process.
‘Unwarranted and unnecessary’
The applications were opposed by the ODCE, represented by Kerida Naidoo SC, who said Delaney’s application for additional time was “unwarranted and unnecessary”.
Any extra time would cause more delay to the investigation process, counsel added.
The ODCE said it wanted the court to fix a date in December for the competition of the extension.
Counsel said that Delaney had initially sought a December completion date when the matter was previously before the court.

In her ruling, Ms Justice Leonie Reynolds said that she was not prepared to make an order allowing Delaney to apply additional search terms to the file inspection process.
The judge said that the material seized had already been inspected using sophisticated software and through several search terms provided by Delaney’s lawyers.
Referring to concerns raised by Delaney about his privacy, the judge said she was satisfied that safeguards contained within the relevant legislation would protect his rights.
The judge added that the inspection process should be completed by 11 January next.
She also confirmed the appointment of barrister Niall Nolan as the independent person who would examine the review materials over which claims of legal privilege are made.
The judge said that Nolan will prepare a report for the court which will aid the judge to determine which of the material is privileged and which is not.
The matter will return before the court in the new year.

915,189,"Dept of Education officials say it was 'impossible' to get staff to check Leaving Cert algorithm",https://www.thejournal.ie/education-officials-calculated-grades-system-5262560-Nov2020/,"OFFICIALS FROM THE Department of Education said the degree of pressure on those involved in establishing the Calculated Grades system was “extreme”.
Dalton Tattan, assistant secretary at the Department of Education, told the Oireachtas Education Committee that the grades coding error was “unfortunate”.
The errors affected 6,500 Leaving Cert students, 6,100 of whom were awarded higher marks.
More than 400 students who missed out on college courses due to the Calculated Grades error were later offered their places.
Tattan said the timetable set out to create the system for Leaving Cert grades was “extremely ambitious”.
Work is under way to prepare for next year’s Leaving Certs exams, which officials at the Department said they are “determined” to run.
Tattan said that while there were coding errors, the degree of pressure on those creating the system was “extreme”.
Around 2,800 students will sit Leaving Cert exams across 600 schools next Monday.
“The Leaving Certificate class of 2020 faced a unique set of circumstances and the decision to provide students with Calculated Grades was taken with the very best interests of students at heart and in full consultation with the partners in education,” Tattan said.
Some initial scoping of the review has taken place and legal advice is currently being sought, having regard to certain litigation in being started.
Senator Fiona O’Loughlin queried whether the system was tested before it went live.
Tattan said it was shocking to find out about the errors, which he said happened in the same section of coding.
He added that the degree of pressure on those creating the system was “extreme”.
Tattan said: “The [Education] Minister [Norma Foley] has already apologised and I would like to reiterate that apology.
All [errors] related to one small section of code described as a family of the coding. It was a particularly complex code.
The errors have been attributed to mistakes in the coding programme made by Polymetrika, the company hired to oversee the Calculated Grades system at a cost of €193,000.
Harold Hislop, chief inspector in the Department of Education, said it was impossible to run checks.
Hislop told the committee that the Department tried to get contingency cover but it was “impossible” to get staff.

“Each of the agencies that would have provided that expertise were taken up by their own processes which was hoovering up the international expertise,” he added.
Sinn Féin’s Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire said he “couldn’t fathom” how the errors occurred.
He said that around 8,000 higher grades awarded last year have led to a “ripple effect” on other students.
The TD queried whether it would be possible to provide deferred offers to students who were pushed out of their college course by the higher grades.
Tattan said the department reviewed that option but said it was not possible to do without rerunning the entire process.
“I don’t think it’s possible to do that without doing a full rerun. We did explore it,” he added.
Tattan also said he didn’t believe any students were treated unfairly, adding that the Department “went out of their way” to ensure the system was fair.

The HSE said that although face visors are suitable in some “limited scenarios”, cloth face coverings or masks are better at stopping the transmission of the virus.
Face visors are suitable for those with breathing difficulties, people who are unable to remove masks without help, and those with particular needs who may feel upset or uncomfortable wearing face masks.
However, Dr John Cuddihy, director of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre warned that visors are not as effective at stopping the spread of Covid-19 as masks are.
“Following a recent review of evidence, we know that visors are less effective than cloth face coverings, and yet we are all seeing visors being used day to day,” he said.
“So our message today is: please wear a face covering, and please don’t see a visor as ‘just as good’. It’s not just as good, and really only suitable for specific circumstances.”

Martin said he had a “warm and engaging call with US President Elect”, stating that he invited Biden and his wife “to come back to Ireland when we will properly mark their success”.
The Taoiseach tweeted that Biden brings “tremendous knowledge and understanding to his new role”.
The Taoiseach said Biden has a “great love for his Irish heritage. He underlined his commitment to the Good Friday Agreement and we spoke of importance of multilateralism, for example, the Paris Accord and the WHO”.
Martin said he congratulated Biden “on the historic nature of his election” and that of Vice President Elect Kamala Harris.
“We agreed to work closely together,” said the Taoiseach.
Government sources have described the call as “very personal”. The two leaders discussed many issues, such as Brexit and the border with Northern Ireland.
Biden is understood to have told the Taoiseach that he is determined to sign back up to the Paris Accord.
A government statement after the phonecall stated:
“In a warm conversation, President-elect Biden recalled his strong Irish roots and his visit to Ireland with his family in 2016.
“The President-elect reaffirmed his full support for the Good Friday Agreement and they discussed the importance of a Brexit outcome that respects the GFA and ensures no return of a border on the island of Ireland.
“They looked forward to working together bilaterally and across a range of international areas including EU-US relations, the UN – including the Security Council, and on the important global challenges of Covid-19, economic recovery and climate change.”
The Fianna Fáil leader was not the first world leader to speak to Biden, with the US President Elect speaking to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau yesterday.
Biden spoke with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier this afternoon.
Earlier, a tweet was sent in error earlier today prior to the Taoiseach speaking with Biden, where the Taoiseach said he had just finished a “very positive call” with the US President Elect. 
A government spokesperson said the tweet was sent in error and that a phone call was being arranged. He has since spoken to Biden.
This is the first telephone call that Martin has received from a US President since he was elected as Taoiseach.

Martin confirmed in July that he had “not spoken with the President of the United States of America since my appointment as Taoiseach”. 
In an interview with TheJournal.ie in September, Martin said it was “no big issue” that he had not heard from US President Donald Trump since becoming Taoiseach.
Martin has previously met Biden.  
“He was the guy that initiated the first Patrick’s Day breakfast… that tradition, which Mike Pence is continuing. He [Biden] is very proud of his Irish roots,” the Taoiseach said previously.
The Taoiseach has said that he is keen to make the trip to the White House next March for the annual St Patrick’s Day events. 
“I think it is very important. All of that [meetings at the White House and Capitol Hill] creates a framework within which jobs can be created, which within Irish business can operate, in terms of exporting and importing.

TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has said that party leaders should meet “without prejudice” to discuss the ongoing controversy surrounding the Supreme Court judge Seamus Woulfe. 
The Taoiseach’s suggestion comes as the Ceann Comhairle warned TDs not to make any comment on the controversy should they be required to “adjudicate on the matter”. 
The potential removal of a judge is possible under Article 35.4 of the Constitution for “stated misbehaviour”, but this would have to be approved by both the Dáil and Seanad.
Such an impeachment motion can be lodged by any TD for the above reason, as outlined by law lecturers Laura Cahillane and David Kenny. 
The discussions come after it was revealed last night that Chief Justice Frank Clarke had informed Woulfe of his personal view that Woulfe should step down from the highest court in the State.
The move came following the fallout from Woulfe’s attendance at the controversial Oireachtas Golf Society dinner in Clifden in August.
Clarke told Woulfe in a letter dated 5 November that it was “the unanimous view of all of the members of the Court” that the affair had caused “significant and irreparable damage” to the court.
A review into Woulfe’s attendance at the dinner by former chief justice Susan Denham found it would be “unjust and disproportionate” for the judge to resign, and he has subsequently declined to step down. 
Labour’s Brendan Howlin said earlier that the “non-Oireachtas process has completed itself” and that TDs and Senators may have to step in. 
The government had sought the advice of Attorney General Paul Gallagher over the matter and said earlier this afternoon that the AG had outlined the “serious constitutional issues that now arise”.
“The members of the government, who are also members of the Oireachtas, are acutely aware of the sensitivity and seriousness of the issues and the need to ensure that the constitutional framework is fully respected by all concerned. This includes avoiding inappropriate public comment,” the government said in a statement.
The government agreed that it will continue to reflect on these issues.
Referencing the AG’s advice this afternoon, Sinn Féin TD Martin Kenny asked Minister for Justice Helen McEntee to come into the Dáil to outline the advice that was received from the AG. 
“I think it’s important that we build maximum consensus among all parties and groupings in this house to try and find a way forward through this,” he said. 
In response, the Taoiseach said he would like to meet with party leaders on the matter. 
“It would be my intention to seek a meeting with party leaders, where we could jointly assess the situation without prejudice. And I’m mindful of comments that have been made by representatives of different parties this morning, in a constructive vein,” Martin said. 
This is a very serious issue, it’s fundamental to the separation of powers, at the very heart of our Constitution. So we have to respond in a very serious and sensitive proper way.
Emphasising the sensitivity around the matters, Ceann Comhairle Sean Ó Fearghaíl warned TDs this afternoon that they should be cautious about what they say.
“Without prejudice to how this matter may proceed, I must point out that members of this house are in a different position to others in relation to commentary insofar as they may ultimately have to adjudicate on the matter in accordance with the Constitution, legislation and standing orders,” Ó Fearghaíl said.
It is crucial therefore that members do not comment on the matter either on the floor of the house or elsewhere in such a way as to give rise to a perception of bias, as this could act as a serious impediment to their ability to discharge their important constitutional functions, if so required in the future. 
Tenable
In a statement last night, Martin Kenny TD said it was “not a desirable, or frankly tenable situation ” for Woulfe to remain on the court. 
Speaking to reporters earlier, the Sligo-Leitrim TD said that he was not expressing his own view but was reflecting those of the other members of the Supreme Court.

“What I said last night is that I reflected what the judiciary had said, I continue to do that,” he said. 
Kenny added that the situation was “fraught with difficulty” but that the judiciary has had “a huge problem” with how Woulfe has dealt with the situation.
Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy TD said there would be significant caution in beginning an impeachment process against Woulfe because he “hasn’t broken any law”.
“An impeachment process is being talked about but we really have no basis for knowing how that would play out,” she said. 
I think there will be a great deal of caution on this. It’s very difficult to know how it will play out. He has lost, obviously, the confidence of his whole colleagues on the Supreme Court, it is really for himself to consider that.
On the potential removal of Woulfe by TDs and Senators, Murphy added: “I think it would be a very difficult one to see it succeeding given that there wasn’t a law broken. And I think there’ll be a caution about commencing something that is weak to begin with. And that doesn’t mean that a very significant issue of judgment.”
Labour’s Aodhán Ó Ríordáin said that politicians needed to be cautious about what the say in relation to the matter, 
“We have to be careful what we say now. And there could be another case in 5-10 years time, we don’t know. So if you’re serious about the Constitution, you’re serious about your role in politics. Then you know the utterances you make are going to have an impact.”
Speaking on RTÉ’s Today with Claire Byrne, Labour’s justice spokesperson Brendan Howlin said that if TDs and Senators were to remove the judge it would be “a very unique process for us”. 
“Ultimately we’re in a situation now where the non-Oireachtas process has completed itself and there are no other options. The Constitution does provide options that may well be taken. But I want to be very clear that in all of this, if there is a procedure that involves invoking article 35.4 of the Constitution, the Dáil and Seanad if you like becomes a chamber of decision in terms of the removal of the judge.”
“And that is a very unique role for us. One bluntly that politicians don’t do well normally in terms of, we are an adversarial type of institution. And we have to have absolute fair procedure, that is crystal clear.”","The government says there are “serious constitutional issues” at play.",8,0,0,27600,"Nov 10th 2020, 1:38 PM"

TODAY, AN IMPISH calm settles in the kitchen. Early January, at home in Mallow, the Sugrues are planning ahead. Underneath the glass top kitchen table sits a map of the world.
James contemplates it briefly, tracing his finger across the places he has been. South Africa catches his eye, annual destination for the GUI National Squad and their winter coaching trip.
Moving north, he points out Oman. A request for him, the British Amateur champion, to play their national open recently came through. Then he looks west. His year is dominated by golfing trips to the United States: The Masters and Augusta National; Winged Foot and the US Open.
“We’re in the process of clearing out the games room for all of James’ golf stuff,” his mother announces. Later, she sends him to retrieve some memorabilia. He returns with a Titleist hat, one sleeve of Pro V1 balls and a white marker emblazoned with the red lion of the Great Britain & Ireland Walker Cup team.
The following day, new treasure arrives in the post. Issued by the Board of Governors of the Augusta National Golf Club, the most prized invitation in golf is, much to my dismay, non transferrable. For the Sugrues, this envelope shines.
Letters concerning James were not always such a joy: “The phone ringing and the notes home from school: ‘James wasn’t in attendance today.’ I’d ask James: ‘We had a free class.’ And he’d be gone up to the golf club to practice. Golf was always his priority.”
Sport offered easy escape. If not golf there was hurling or football as freedom. Tennis, rugby and soccer too. Even the family shop provided cover.
His recollection is rosy: “It was so handy. My auntie, who acts like a child, used to write me notes if I ever needed them: ‘James was at the dentist yesterday.’ That sort of thing.”
“I didn’t know that until now,” his mother cuts in. “I remember the teacher came to me and she said: ‘He really does have to get involved in the school play, Margaret. And so does his cousin Ciarán.’ So Ciarán ran the shop and James pulled the curtain. That was their contribution to the play.”
Exam time compounded her worry.
“All I wanted was for him to get his Leaving Cert,” she recounts. “Now he won’t be doing Medicine but he got his Leaving Cert, and that’s fine.”
“Sound,” says James, droll as ever.

Mick Sugrue, the son of Kerry parents, was raised in Manchester. The family moved home when he was 16. Down Munster way, the cultural exchange provoked plain reproach.
Once, he ventured to Kanturk, hunting for pumps: ‘Arrah, get out of it. You’re in the wrong shop.’
English slang for runners sat unappropriated by local retailers.
The Sugrues had set up shop in Mallow, selling furniture on O’Brien Street. Mick went down a different route, training as a TV engineer. He opened Sugrue Electronics next door to the family store.
His specialist operation thrived at a time when televisions were not sold in supermarkets. These days, their premises is let, a vape the only electrical good on display. They moved with the economy, though Mick still prefers a smoke.
Back home, he steps out periodically. He takes shelter in the garage, puffing away while the dogs, Ruby and Sheba, make their move. On Mick’s watch, they stay outdoors. As night falls, James retrieves an old duvet to set a bed for the family pets inside the back door, an act that plays out every evening.
Margaret describes their daily barter: “He freaks out: ‘They should be outside.’ We leave him say his piece and then bring the dogs in.”
Life does not always turn into expectation. Of late, fortune has been kind. Success for James, on such a grand scale, dropped like gold from the sky. Winning the British Amateur at Portmarnock last June, 12 months, granted entry to the big time, tickets to places he could have but dream about.
Time, that finite resource, is their most valued commodity.
“He’d never talk about it,” says James of his father.
“You’re right, James,” Margaret adds.
“It’s like he had done something illegal. Even if somebody died from cancer and I asked what happened, he’d be like: ‘What happens them all?’ That will never be talked about, ever.”
15 years after diagnosis, Mick keeps coy about his condition.
“We were in America on holidays and he went in to buy a shirt,” Margaret recalls. “The man in the shop said his neck was 17 and a half.”
This nuance evoked surprise: “There’s no way that’s right.”
“I have a bit of a lump there alright,” Mick conceded.
Tests uncovered a tumour but treatment was compromised by its location. Margaret retraces the journey: “He had Hodgkin’s disease and the tumour was attached to the main artery to his heart and his brain. When they opened him, they had to close him straight away.”
Unsuited to surgery, he faced an aggressive form of chemotherapy. Although the medics advised them to share this news with their children, Margaret opted to keep them out of the loop.
“There was no need for them to know,” she reasons. “You’re looking at a child going into bed at night and they’re told: ‘Your father has cancer.’ We continued on as normal as possible.”
They worked hard to maintain that front. Margaret left her job as a legal executive to manage the shop; Mick did the school run before his chemo sessions, finishing in time for the children coming home. They took pre-emptive measures. Mick shaved his head, a cosmetic touch to disguise receding hair.
Friends and family mobilised: “My mother did the dinners for them every day. Mick got up and came to the shop around 11am. We’d go to bed early at night. I rang Michelle’s friends’ parents and Edward’s friends’ parents, and told them. They rallied in then.”
Life continued its march: Edward prepared for Confirmation, James was readied for Communion.
“I don’t know how I got through,” Margaret admits. “You just do it. There’s no point in laying down and crying. Just move along.”

No need for tears when you find humour in the darkness: “My cousin brought him up to the Mercy one day for his chemo. And Mick’s mother, Lord have mercy on her, had given him tomato soup beforehand. When he came out of the Mercy, he puked all over the place. Martin, my cousin, he rang: ‘He’s vomiting blood.’ Mick was trying to say: ‘I’m not. It’s the tomato soup.’ Ah lads…”
Good news emerged after six months: the tumour had retreated. But ordeal had taken its toll. He developed diabetes and is now insulin dependent, injecting himself at least four times daily. This constant need leaves his body bruised.
Margaret, too, has suffered serious affliction: “I got this very rare autoimmune disease and I ended up in the hospital. I went for tests and they rang from the lab: ‘Bring her in straightaway.’ My blood was thinning. If I had an accident, I would have bled to death. It happens about three people, maybe, in a year. I had to go up then every day to the hospital, have a drip and things like that. I never laid down. I kept going. I was fine.”
So firm a tone moves on the conversation.
***
A sheepish grin greets the next question.
“She’s a nice person, first of all, anyway,” he drawls, inclining his head towards Mum. “I can’t find the words.”
A prompt across the table: “Supportive.”
“Supportive, yeah,” James affirms. “Always on the go. A busy person.”
But son does not take after mother. On this point, they agree.
“He is definitely like his father,” Margaret insists. “He is the polar opposite of me.”
He sounds a grateful note: “Dad is more laidback than Mam, thankfully.”

At times, the twain do meet.
Three years ago, competing for the North of Ireland at Royal Portrush, he woke late and missed his first round tee time. Disqualified, he travelled home expecting flack.
“I’d say he probably thought I was going to be giving out,” Margaret suggests. “Nah: ‘You missed it, that’s it, get on with it.’ On reflection, it was the best thing that happened him in his whole career.”
On the journey down, he vowed to make amends. Next up was the South of Ireland at Lahinch. For the first time in his career, he gave himself a target.
“You said you would go down there and win that,” Mick reminds him. “Some fellas would set goals for themselves. James never did.”
The break from habit spurred victory. From there, his career kicked off. He moved onto the National panel, earning his first Senior cap with Ireland the following year. Sugrue, who made waves at 15 by winning the Connacht Boys (U18), was no longer just a prospect.
Beyond these shores, he had yet to make a mark. Golfers often weave an undistinguished path. Then suddenly a leap and separation from the pack.
“You can be number one or number 231,” Margaret surmises. “You still have to go out, play your game, and win your match.”
The British Open returning to Irish soil framed 2019. Beyond that historic scene, golf’s rising stars had eyes fixed on Portmarnock. Come June, they were gathered in North Dublin for the British Amateur.
Five days in, Sugrue stood unbeaten. Across the grand old links, he thrilled a growing gallery, the partisan crowd gripped as he plotted his way to the final.
“I was worried sick,” Margaret demurs. “As a mother, you want the best for your child. You don’t want him to be disappointed.”
Mick is to the point: “She’d be down more than James. Her sister went to Portmarnock and she couldn’t go round. She was bawling crying in the corner. Saying the Rosary.”
“I was gray,” Margaret continues. “I lost a half a stone while I was up there. Now, I put it all back on.”
James quickly brightens: “We can bring you up there again.”
His offer meets a derisive look. Stress coloured her experience.
“I did not sleep on the Friday night,” she relays.
On the morning of the final, Mick read an interview James had given: “He said: ‘Didn’t get a great night’s sleep. Went to sleep at 11 o’clock and woke up when the alarm woke me up.’ For fuck sake, he got eight or nine hours, like. And he thought that was a bad night.”

Poise has passed from paternal side: “At the start, you’d be afraid that he’d make a balls of a shot. He was invited up to the Captain’s Drive In last year. Someone came up to me and said: ‘Are you nervous about him driving?’ I said: ‘Definitely not. I’ve never been more confident of anything in my life.’ Not at this stage of the game.”
Father proved correct. No need for worry at Portmarnock when James raced into the lead. Five up after nine and three clear at halfway, the Corkman had control. But a 36-hole decider is relentlessly demanding. Euan Walker, his opponent from Scotland, reeled him in.
All square, they turned to face the penultimate hole. Sugrue made a standard par: fairway, green, two putts. Walker went right off the tee – a no-go area that week – and the home favourite won the hole with regulation four.
On 18, he was crowned champion, the trophy bringing with it entry to the British Open.
Returning to Portrush upset his stock demeanour. In that regard, he was not alone. Playing alongside Darren Clarke, he walked off the first expressing sheer relief: “I was like: ‘Thank God that’s over. I was going to hit iron.’ And he was like: ‘Iron? I’d be afraid I’d miss it. And it is an iron.’ He hit driver.”
The Mallow faithful threaded the crowd. Although Sugrue missed the cut by one, the lighter moments came quick to hand.
Margaret replays a clip: round two, James hunting for birdie, aboard the 13th green.
“I can still see where I was standing,” she divulges. “We were all hoping he would get the putt.”
Mick layers context: “If there’s a thousand people there and Kevin O’Keeffe is there, you’ll probably hear Kevin O’Keeffe out of all of them.”
When Sugrue’s birdie try lipped out, the place fell to silence.
“TOUGH LUCK, SUGGIE!” blared across the green. “MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ONE!”
“I knew it was Kevin,” James avers. “I was just laughing at it.”
***
Those moments take him back to the beginning; back to Mallow, back into the world that made him.
Last one still at home (Michelle and Edward both work as Radiographers in Dublin), he relishes country ways: a ramble with the dogs, a roam through neighbouring fields. Shooting is another sport to him, the gun inherited from his grandfather. Old calendars he repurposes for target practice, marking circles with a geometric compass on the blank back covers.
“An A4 sheet is flimsy,” he notes. “If you’re shooting something that’s 120 yards away, the slightest little movement will throw the bullet off a long way. You have to control your breathing.”
The practical always attracted him. James and the Ford Fiesta is a story only his mother can tell: “He was about eight. And I was inside here. Next thing, the garage door opened and this Fiesta passed me out. Down the driveway, into the field, all around. I, roaring. My mother on the couch: ‘Margaret, stop roaring.’ Me back: ‘Look at him!’ Next thing, he went all around the back of the house, up the driveway, back again, into the garage, parked her up. His head was barely above the steering wheel.”

She remains his biggest fan.
“I do pity people down the town,” Mick juts in. “They’d meet us and they’d be like: ‘How’s James getting on?’ All they want to hear is: ‘James is getting on fine.’ With Margaret: ‘Well, he won this, he’s going there…’ Half an hour later, they’re still there.”
Around here, the mocking never stops. A wicked strain runs through the Sugrues and Mick’s brother Peter is wildest of all, an ever ready wit. James knows his form. They often work together, making deliveries for the family furniture store.
“He’s lethal,” he states. “You could go into a couple, 80 odd. We’d be giving them a mattress and he’d be like: ‘You can’t be having sex on that now for two weeks.’ He’s unreal. And people love him.”
Peter is not the only Sugrue regarded with great affection. Since the British Amateur win, James Sugrue has become a local poster boy. During the Open at Portrush, his picture adorned shop windows. Visitors to Mallow were greeted by his image on a billboard. Some fans, though, make strange requests.
“He was delivering a wardrobe and the woman asked him to sign the inside of it,” Margaret reveals. “I wouldn’t be asking him to sign my brand new wardrobe.”
“I thought she was messing,” James smiles. “Next thing, she brought me up a marker. I signed the inside of it. Every time you open it, you’ll see: James Sugrue, Amateur Champion. She took a picture of me in the wardrobe, signing it. She’s very nice.”
Some days, he walks through town with the mobile pressed against his ear, just to get a break from golfing conversations. One day, he might make his career from the game. Such ambitions are too distant for him to contemplate.
“James takes one competition at a time,” his father summarises. “He doesn’t do any long-term planning.”
Mother lends a favoured saw: “The Lord laughs at those who plan.”
James and the final word: “I won’t have Him laughing at me.”

A CONVICTED HUMAN-TRAFFICKER who was wanted for over a decade has been arrested and brought before the High Court in Dublin.
Liviu Biliuta (55) with a former address in the city of Botosani, Romania, was convicted by a Botosani court in 2008 of the trafficking of an adult female and girl, for the purposes of prostitution.
Detective Garda Tony Keane this afternoon told Mr Justice Paul Burns that at 6.59am this morning he arrested Biliuta, who had been living at a Dublin address, on Sheriff Street, Dublin 1.
Biliuta was cautioned after questioning and brought by Detective Garda Keane to the Bridewell Garda Station.
Biliuta was convicted by the Romanian court of human trafficking for helping to bring the girl and an adult female to the Netherlands during 2004-05, for which he received a seven-year jail sentence.
Detective Garda Keane told Mr Justice Burns that he arrested Biliuta on foot of a European Arrest Warrant endorsed by the High Court in 2016.
He said that Biliuta’s convictions in Romania were in relation to “organised and serious crime”.
In a press release this morning, Detective Superintendent Michael J Mullen of the Garda Extradition Unit described Biliuta ‘s arrest as a “significant arrest, co-ordinated by detectives attached to organised and serious crime, that represents our ongoing commitment to ensuring persons wanted on foot of international arrest warrants are brought to justice”.

The accused appeared before Limerick District Court the afternoon via a video-link from the woman’s section of Limerick Prison.
She spoke only to confirm her name and that she could see and hear the proceedings.
Solicitor Darach McCarthy, acting as an agent for the accused’s solicitor, sought “reporting restrictions” in media coverage of the case, going forward.
McCarthy claimed the accused had been “subjected to particularly vile” reports by some media.
The solicitor did not specifically identify any media, and he indicated he was “not” referring to all “members of the Fourth Estate”.
The woman is charged with making four threats that she would kill or cause serious harm to a woman, and a man, on various dates this year.
The accused was arrested by gardaí last September and did not reply to the charges after she was cautioned.

Today, gardaí told the court the garda file was “at an advanced stage, but it hasn’t left the garda station”.
McCarthy said he was “somewhat concerned” about this, and he requested the court make an order marking the case “peremptory against the state” in four weeks time, meaning if the state’s book of evidence was not served at that point, he could seek to have the case thrown out.
Judge Mary Larkin refused this, and remanded the accused in continuing custody to appear before the court again on 24 November, via video link, for directions from the state.

928,190,"Explainer: The logistical challenges for the roll-out of a Covid-19 vaccine",https://www.thejournal.ie/explainer-logistics-vaccine-5262089-Nov2020/,"THE ANNOUNCEMENT FROM Pfizer and BioNTech yesterday that their Covid-19 vaccine was 90% effective in its large-scale Phase 3 trial was much needed positive news in the pandemic.
It has been hailed as a ‘watershed moment’ and welcomed by scientists, health officials and world leaders. However they have also cautioned people to recognise that yesterday’s announcement does not signal a swift end to the global pandemic.
What happens next will take time, money and a lot of planning – and the vaccine that is being developed by Pfizer and BioNTech may not even be the one most widely used across the world.
What do we know about the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine?
The vaccine candidate is one of ten at the Phase 3 clinical stage, which involves tens of thousands of volunteers, some of whom will be given a placebo. At this phase, the developers are aiming to catch the less common side effects and to assess how effective it is across a diverse pool of people in terms of age, race and sex.
This vaccine uses molecules called ‘messenger RNA’ (mRNA) and is a vaccine approach that has never reached approval before.
Many traditional vaccines involve injecting people with a small amount of the virus. 
With this new approach, the immune system never has to be exposed to the actual virus. Instead, it makes human cells grow what is know as spike proteins, causing the immune system to produce antibodies against the virus. 
The scientific community has been very excited about this novel approach and one of the main positive takeaways from the news yesterday is that this experimental method of developing a vaccine, which is also being used by Moderna, appears to work well. 
The Pfizer/BioNTech Phase 3 study enrolled 43,538 participants, 42% of whom have ‘diverse backgrounds’, according to the companies. This included participants aged 65 to 85. It said no “serious safety concerns” have been observed. 
There have been 94 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in trial participants. 
Pfizer/BioNTech said the vaccine was found to be more than 90% effective in preventing Covid-19 in participants. 
Logistical challenges
The vaccine requires two doses. This means twice the number of visits to a vaccination centre – or wherever it is administered. At best this would result in resource and administrative challenges in first world countries, but it presents a much more serious barrier for less developed countries.
Another serious roadblock is the temperature at which this vaccine needs to be stored: at -80 degrees. 
For temperatures as cold as the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccination requires, dry ice has to be brought into the mix. Currently, the vaccine is shipped in coolers that can be fed with dry ice to keep it frozen for 15 days. After this it can be refrigerated for up to five days before being diluted and injected.
The medical community is already well familiar with the use of the ‘cold chain’ for vaccinations such as flu, but GPs and pharmacists, who play a significant role in the vaccination programme, do not have this kind of infrastructure.
Speaking to TheJournal.ie Dr Nuala O’Connor, Cork GP and Covid lead for the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) said GPs “don’t have fridges that go down to minus 80″.
“The way it works through the national procurement system is we get a delivery every two weeks from the cold chain service. There are specialised vans that come with the vaccines. Now I don’t know whether the vans can do that temperature but we currently don’t have the capacity to store vaccines in our surgeries.
“If that were to become the main vaccine, there would obviously be a lot of logistics in rolling it out via GPs or pharmacies, it might all have to be done in specialised centres.” 
Infectious disease expert Professor Sam McConkey told RTÉ’s Today with Claire Byrne that, if it had to be done, getting a minus 80 degree fridge could be done “relatively easily” and those working in hospitals and laboratories use liquid nitrogen and dry ice regularly. 
However he said people will need training and personal protective equipment as there are risks associated with these substances. 
“I think that’s a surmountable hurdle in Ireland, I think it will be harder in developing countries,” he said.
“I’ve worked a lot in west Africa and their having a minus 80 [degree] freezer all over rural west Africa might be  more difficult. I see that as a technical challenge that could be met in Irish general practice if we needed to.”
Safety questions
With the fast development of all of these vaccines, there are understandable concerns about how safe they are.
Speaking last month to TheJournal.ie, Dr Fidelma Fitzpatrick, consultant and senior lecturer in microbiology at the Royal College of Surgeons (RCSI) said it normally takes between five to 10 years to bring a vaccine to market.
“There has never been a time when the entire world has been so focused on one type of vaccination programme so there will be huge scrutiny of the safety of these vaccines,” she said.
“The whole point of the Phase 3 trials is to find any rare side effects that wouldn’t come through in the Phase 1 and 2 trials.
“This isn’t going to get a free pass, there’s too much to lose, the entire world is looking at it so the regulators aren’t just going to push things through.”
Professor Sam McConkey said most products disappear quickly from the human body so the majority of side effects would happen soon after the product is taken. Pfizer and BioNTech have not released detailed data on any side effects associated with their vaccine, other than stating in their press release that no serious safety concerns have been observed.
“The thing that reassures me about safety is the 44,000 people, that’s quite a large number,” McConkey said. “Other products might be brought to market, for example, with 5,000 or 10,000 people who received it so it’s the size of the trial and the quality of the follow-up and the duration of the follow-up that really matters.”
Could we get the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in Ireland?
In total there are ten candidate vaccines at the Phase 3 clinical stage, with some like Moderna (also an mRNA vaccine) aiming to file for authorisation later this month.

They will not all face the same logistical challenges as the Pfizer/BioNTech candidate. the Oxford/Aztrazeneca vaccine, for example, only requires one dose and does not have to be kept at such a low temperature. 
It’s possible the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will be one of the vaccines used in the European Union. Today European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the Commission will authorise a contract for up to 300 million doses of the BioNTech and Pfizer vaccine.
She described the vaccine as “the most promising so far”. 
The Commission has also reached agreements with three other companies that have a vaccine in development:
It agreed with AztraZeneca to purchase 300 million doses with an option to buy 100 million more.
It signed a contract to purchase up to 300 million doses of the Sanofi-GSK vaccine.
It approved a contract with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV to purchase 200 million vaccines with the possibility to purchase a further 200 million.
Von der Leyen said once the vaccine becomes available, the plan is to “deploy it quickly everywhere in Europe”. 
“This will be the fourth contract with a pharmaceutical company to buy vaccines. And more will come. Because we need to have a broad portfolio of vaccines based on different technologies,” she said.
“We have already started working with Member States to prepare national vaccination campaigns.
“We are almost there. In the meantime, let us be prudent, and stay safe.”
Even after the logistical challenges with vaccines are worked out, the mass production and distribution of the product will take time. It is likely the vaccination will first be given to healthcare workers and those in the most vulnerable categories, such as people with underlying conditions and those living in residential care homes. 
A significant proportion of the world’s population will have to be vaccinated – including those in less developed countries where there will be greater challenges – before countries can return to anything close to the normal we knew before the pandemic. 
Health officials and doctors have been quick to remind people the Pfizer/BioNTech data has not been published, peer reviewed or assessed by regulators and that a press release from the two companies does not mean public health measures can be abandoned.
Yesterday Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan pointed out that the Pfizer/BioNTech Phase 3 trial is not yet complete. 
“We’ve seen it [the press release] and we know there are a number of companies involved in vaccine development,” he said. “And we’re hopeful that we will see reliable data when it becomes available to the regulatory authorities, who have to inspect this data. When it’s published in the scientific literature and we’re in a position to examine it, then we’ll determine,” he said yesterday.
“But we’ve seen it and we’re aware of it and, obviously, if these are borne out when we see the regularity data, if these are borne out when we see these scientific publications, that’s the kind of thing we’ll want to be seeing.”","The news yesterday was really positive, but there are practical considerations to bear in mind.",2,0,1,20515,"Nov 10th 2020, 4:09 PM"

Delaney was called before the Oireachtas Sports Committee in April last year to answer questions from TDs about the Football Association of Ireland’s finances. 
During this hearing, Healy-Rae didn’t use the three-minute time slot allocated to him to ask questions, and instead praised Delaney for his work for Kerry clubs:
“I am quite confident that the only thing that Mr Delaney could be accused of is being passionately committed to his job… that all he was trying to do was good.”
Source: TheJournal.ie/YouTube
At the time, the full scale of the financial problems at the Football Association of Ireland wasn’t known; but concerns were being raised after The Sunday Times revealed that John Delaney gave a €100,000 ‘bridging loan’ to the Association in April 2017.

Delaney later stood down from his role as CEO, and took on the role of ‘Executive Vice President’. He later resigned from the FAI in September 2019.
The day before his appearance at the Oireachtas committee, Sport Ireland announced that it was temporarily suspending funding to the organisation over the issue. 
During an interview with Radio Kerry this morning, when asked why he supported Delaney at that time, Healy Rae apologised, saying that he was “wrong”: 
Anything that I said, looking back on it now, was wrong. The reason I would have said it at the time was I thought I was right.
If anything I said offended anybody or insulted anybody I’m profoundly sorry for that.
The Radio Kerry presenter who interviewed Healy-Rae this morning, Jerry O’Sullivan, asked Healy-Rae why he gave Delaney his ‘full backing’ at the Oireachtas meeting considering the questions being asked about the FAI at the time. Healy-Rae was also not a member of that Oireachtas committee, but requested to take part.

Healy-Rae replied that he attended the Oireachtas hearing because anytime Delaney was asked to support small clubs in Kerry, he did so.

The ‘Sold A Pup’ campaign aims to warn people about the cruelty involved to puppies sold online, to stop the illegal sale of dogs and to help stop puppy farming in Ireland.
New laws introduced in February make it a legal requirement for puppies to be eight weeks or older when being sold, as well as for owners to display microchips and a seller/supplier number if they sell more than five pets in a year.
However, Dogs Trust has warned that many sellers are continuing to flout these rules.
Research carried out by the charity found that 72% of respondents were unaware of the new regulations and that 68% of respondents were unable to spot an illegal ad.

Speaking about the campaign, Dogs Trust Ireland Executive Director Becky Bristow explained that many people unwittingly buy dogs bred on puppy farms.
“Puppy farmers often go to extreme lengths to hide the true environment their pups originate from as they prioritise profits over the welfare of the dogs in their care,” she said.

The cash injection announced today represents an additional €48 million on that which was announced in the Budget last month.  
The new supports include €22 million in additional funding for Cork and Shannon Airport and an extra €21 million for the Regional Airports Programme, which will benefit Knock, Kerry and Donegal airports. 
The funding package will also include an Airport Charges Rebate Scheme to run from January to March that the Department of Transport says is subject to State Aid approval from the EU Commission.
That scheme benefits all Irish airports, including Dublin Airport, to the tune of €20 million.
The rebate scheme was among the recommendations made by the Task Force for Aviation Recovery. The task force had previously warned that Ireland’s aviation industry ‘will not survive’ the Covid-19 pandemic if travel advice is not changed.
Announcing the additional funding today, Transport Minister Eamon Ryan said that the government is “fully alert to the devastating impact of the global pandemic” on the aviation industry. 
“It is expected that it may be some time before it is possible to permit a large scale return to air travel, but we remain committed to ensuring that the aviation sector can maintain the necessary core capability to retain strategic connectivity and to quickly rebound when circumstances allow,” he said.
I welcome the fact that the Government today approved this department’s proposal for an additional €48 m funding for the sector,  focusing in particular on Cork and Shannon and our smaller regional airports which are important contributors to the economics of their regions.

Ryanair gave a cautious welcome to the announcement. A spokesperson said:
“Three months of rebates does not go far enough. We urge Minister Ryan to adopt the Aviation Task Force recommendation to fund airport rebates for a period of three years.
Over 325,000 people are employed in the Irish Tourism industry and depend on airlines to deliver customers. If our Aviation and Tourism industries are to have any chance of rebounding to pre-Covid levels, then a structural package of incentives is required over three years – not three months – to support this industry on which so many people depend for their livelihoods.
The EU’s traffic light system for international travel came into effect in Ireland on Sunday.
It is hoped the plan will jump start the aviation sector by waiving the requirement to restrict movements if someone has had a negative Covid-19 test or has arrived from a ‘Green’ country on the list.

EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT Ursula von der Leyen has said the Commission will tomorrow authorise a contract for up to 300 million doses of the BioNTech and Pfizer vaccine.
The announcement follows news from the two companies yesterday that the vaccine was 90% effective in its Phase 3 trial, which involved more than 40,000 participants.
Von der Leyen today described the vaccine as “the most promising so far”. 
“Once this vaccine becomes available, our plan is to deploy it quickly, everywhere in Europe. This will be the fourth contract with a pharmaceutical company to buy vaccines. And more will come. Because we need to have a broad portfolio of vaccines based on different technologies,” she said.
“We have already started working with Member States to prepare national vaccination campaigns.
“We are almost there. In the meantime, let us be prudent, and stay safe.”
The Commission has also reached agreements with three other companies that have a vaccine in development:
It agreed with AstraZeneca to purchase 300 million doses with an option to buy 100 million more.
It signed a contract to purchase up to 300 million doses of the Sanofi-GSK vaccine.
It approved a contract with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV to purchase 200 million vaccines with the possibility to purchase a further 200 million.
All of these agreements are on the basis that the vaccine has been proven to be safe and effective once it has gone through regulatory assessments.
The announcement yesterday was cautiously welcomed by world leaders and health officials who described it as a positive step.
At yesterday’s Department of Health Covid-19 briefing, Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan said it is “certainly night time for celebration” yet as the trial is not yet complete and regulatory authorities will still have to inspect the data when it is published.
Dr Cillian de Gascun, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory (NVRL) said the news is “positive”, but there will still be practical challenges to work out with any vaccine.
“Over 90% effective – if that holds true in the real world – will be a very good start from a vaccination perspective. Obviously, it’s a two dose schedule so there’s some potential logistical challenges around that,” he said.

“The duration of protection, obviously is something we don’t yet know. Similarly, we know from the media reports this vaccine requires an ultra cold chain of minus 80 degrees. So, again, logistically it could be difficult to roll it out so it’s not going to be the global solution, but certainly it’s very positive first step.”
Suspension of Sinovac candidate
The World Health Organisation has said 44 candidate vaccines are in clinical evaluation with 10 of those at the final Phase 3 clinical stage.
One of these candidate vaccinations, from Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac, hit a roadblock on the same day Pfizer/BioNTech were hailed for their success so far. 
Brazilian regulators halted trials of Sinovac’s vaccine in the South American country citing an “adverse incident” involving a volunteer recipient.
Health regulator Anvisa said it could not give details on what happened because of privacy regulations.
The public health centre coordinating the trials of the vaccine in Brazil, the Butantan Institute, said yesterday it was “surprised” by the decision. The institute “is investigating in detail what happened,” and “is at the Brazilian regulatory agency’s disposal to provide any clarification necessary on any adverse incident the clinical trials may have presented,” it said.

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN the shouting stops? 
That’s the subject of Damian Lawlor’s new book, When the World Stops Watching, in which Lawlor explores how 16 Irish athletes adapted to the second life of their retirements, and the book tells a host of different stories stretching across a vast spectrum of emotions. 
Damian is our guest on the latest episode of Behind the Lines, our sportswriting podcast exclusive to members of The42. 
(Each episode of Behind the Lines features a lengthy interview with a sportswriter about their career and their favourite pieces of writing, and to gain access to a 51-episode back catalogue, head over to members.the42.ie.) 
The thread linking the disparate stories told in the book is an almost instant loss of identity. Some deal with it better than others. 
Tommy Bowe, for example, slipped seamlessly into a television career that might yet prove to be even more successful than his rugby years, and Kevin Doyle moved back home and has hardly ever been happier.
Conversely, Niall Quinn retired and withdrew almost entirely from the game, marooning himself on the golf course and even once turning around at Dublin airport to avoid finding himself adjacent to the sport when first asked to do some punditry for Sky. 
The most affecting tale, however, is that of Paul McGee, a blindingly talented Premier League footballer who saw his career wrecked by appalling injury.
Few sports books have as bracing an opening line. 
“Most people shop at Woodie’s for homeware or garden furniture. Paul McGee went there for a rope to hang himself with.”
His suicide attempt was mercifully interrupted by a friend who sensed something was wrong, and as the book details, Paul recovered and is now in a much better place. 
McGee made his name in Ireland with EMFA – an early version of Kilkenny City – and then Bohemians, and rebuffed Terry Venables and Spurs’ overtures to sign for Colchester and the promise of game-time. The day he signed he told them he wasn’t planning to stick around for long, and so it proved: within seven weeks he was signed by Wimbledon, then the FA Cup holders after the Crazy Gang’s famous upset of Liverpool at Wembley in 1988. 
The day McGee would make his debut, manager Bobby Gould sidled up alongside him to tell him the good news. Gould unfortunately told him mid-act, and so needed to wipe down his shoes when McGee swung around to face him in awe. 
It was the day of his 21st birthday and he scored, which set the now famed-permutations of the season’s climax. Arsenal needed to go to Anfield and win by two goals to win the league, which, thanks to Michael Thomas, they ultimately did.

McGee star was rising too fast for Wimbledon, and he ultimately signed a £3 million deal with Coventry City. To give an idea as to how his talent was reflected in the fee: Manchester United paid only £750,000 more for Roy Keane. 
Damian takes up the story on the podcast. 
“He went back to the Plough Lane after the contract had been signed, and received a round of applause from his team-mates as he was very popular. He then decided he would join in a training game, as he knew the signing process meant he might not get another game for a week or so.
“During the session a high ball came in, Neil Sullivan collided with him and smashed his leg. It took a year-and-a-half, almost two years, to get it right. 
“And as he lay on the hospital bed with the leg in the cast, the letter arrived from Jack Charlton inviting him into the Irish set-up. He never made it in.
“He got back to playing at Premier League level but the speed was gone, he wasn’t happy there, and the club wanted to offload him as they couldn’t afford his wages, they were sinking.
“He went back to the Irish league and then the League of Ireland, and had spells with Linfield, Athlone and Bohemians but gradually the star faded. 
Then he just lost his way. But the night he was found by his friend was the turning point of his life. Now he goes to the gym every day and has improved his diet, but he says the most important thing he did was to get clinical help and treatment. He bounced back to the stage he played Ireland over-40s, masters level. He had an U21 cap but never got a senior cap. Ireland were short on the left wing as he was hitting the scene, they were playing Staunton there out of position. So he would have got a chance.
“He had all those demons playing on his mind that he could have done this, and he could have done that, but he has got back to such an extent now he loves talking about football on his job.” 
McGee is working as a courier now, and also works with Pieta House. 
“You won’t meet a more genuine guy”, says Damian, “and he’s glad the message is getting out there.”

THE DÁIL IS to being suspended this afternoon so TDs can move from Leinster House to the Convention Centre Dublin (CCD) ahead of a confidence vote in Tánaiste Leo Varadkar. 
Last Friday, Sinn Féin tabled a motion of no confidence in Varadkar that was to be debated this afternoon but this is now being usurped by a government motion of confidence in Varadkar. 
The Dáil met at 2pm and voted with reduced numbers, 26 votes to 19, to suspend for 90 minutes so TDs can relocate to the CCD and debate and vote on the confidence motion. 
Leaders’ Questions will take place in the CCD and the debate and vote of confidence in the Tánaiste will take place later this evening. 
Votes involving all 160 TDs must take place in the CCD due to social distancing requirements and the vote on Varadkar will require all TDs present. 
The government and opposition TDs have blamed each other for the requirement to move across the Liffey, with Fine Gael saying Sinn Féin should have flagged the no confidence vote before last Friday. 
Sinn Féin says the issue is due the government’s insistence on tabling its own vote of confidence in Varadkar, instead of proceeding with the no confidence motion. 
The Dáil usually sits in the CCD on Wednesdays to take votes in blocs while all members are present. It had been expected that Sinn Féin’s motion would be tabled today and voted on tomorrow.
Speaking to TheJournal.ie, Fine Gael’s Brendan Griffin TD said that confidence votes cannot be deferred. He also said that once the Dáil concluded last Thursday and its business was set for the following week it had to meet again today in Leinster House.
“Under standing orders you can’t have a deferred vote, or a reduced vote, on a motion of confidence or no confidence. That’s clear in the rules of the house,” he said.

Once they called the motion of no confidence, we were in a situation where that can’t be held in Leinster House on Tuesday night. So we have to move business over to the Convention Centre. It’s quite as simple as that. 
Sinn Féin has however hit out at government’s decision to table a confidence vote in Varadkar, saying that the government could have done this tomorrow instead. 
The party’s chief whip Pádraig Mac Lochlainn TD said this decision was about removing speaking time from the opposition. He told TheJournal.ie that changing the motion to a confidence vote means that government TDs would get about double the speaking time than if it were a no confidence motion. 
“Sinn Féin and the other opposition parties and groups put forward alternative scheduling options to the government but they have rejected them with excuses that don’t stack up,” he said. 
“It is clear that the government are trying to stymie opposition voices and are trying to distract from the real issue at hand by playing games with the Dáil schedule.”

Fianna Fáil TD says there are inconsistencies in Varadkar's statement, but adds he shouldn't resign

Sinn Féin tabled the motion of no confidence in Varadkar on Friday after the revelation that he had sent a copy of an agreement between the government and the Irish Medical Organisation to a rival GP group while he was taoiseach last year.
Varadkar faced questions in the Dáil last Tuesday over the revelations, which were first published by Village Magazine.
In the Dáil, the Tánaiste apologised for “errors of judgement” and said that he was “not close friends” with former NAGP president Maitiú Ó Tuathail, to whom he sent the agreement.  
Sinn Féin have accused Varadkar of throwing Ó Tuathail “under the bus” and tabled the no confidence motion claiming that he had “faced no sanction” over the controversy.
Speaking on RTÉ’s This Week programme over the weekend, Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said the sanction Varadkar faced was having to answer questions in the Dáil last week.
“The sanction is the accountability of Dáil Éireann and the sanction is all of us being aware of what are the standards that we have to adhere to,” Donohoe said.

936,189,"UK Catholic Church leader says he won't resign over report into child sex abuse allegations",https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-catholic-church-leader-report-5262252-Nov2020/,"THE HEAD OF the Catholic Church in England and Wales said he will not resign over a damning report into child sex abuse allegations.
Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the Archbishop of Westminster Diocese, said he recently offered his resignation to the Pope on account of his age and nothing else, but that he was told to stay in post.
It comes as the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) report into the Catholic Church, published today, found Cardinal Nichols “seemingly put the reputation of the church” above his duty to sex assault victims.
It added that he had demonstrated “no acknowledgement of any personal responsibility to lead or influence change”.
The report findings were met with calls for Cardinal Nichols to resign – something he says he will refuse to do.
He told the PA news agency: “I was 75 very recently. A few weeks ago, as according to the law of the Church, I sent my resignation into Pope Francis and I have received a very unequivocal reply, and that is that he tells me to stay in office here.
So that is what I will do, that is where my orders come from. I’m staying.
Asked if he was the right person to lead the Catholic Church in England and Wales, despite the report’s findings, Cardinal Nichols said: “I do what I’m told. The Holy Father put me here and he tells me to stay here – that’s enough for me.”
The report found that the Catholic Church repeatedly failed to support victims and survivors, while taking positive action to protect alleged perpetrators, including moving them to different parishes.
It highlighted the case of Father James Robinson, a serial paedophile, who was moved to another parish within the Archdiocese of Birmingham after complaints were first made in the 1980s. He was later jailed for 21 years.
The report also identified how senior leaders were resistant to external oversight and have only partially implemented the recommendations of previous reviews.
Focusing on Cardinal Nichols, the report said: “In the cases of (two complainants), Cardinal Nichols demonstrated a lack of understanding of the impact of their abuse and experiences and seemingly put the reputation of the church first.”
The report also found Cardinal Nichols demonstrated “no acknowledgement of any personal responsibility to lead or influence change”.
It added: “The responses of church leaders over time were marked by delay in implementing change as well as reluctance to acknowledge responsibility, to hold individuals to account or to make sincere apologies.
“They conveyed on occasions a grudging and unsympathetic attitude to victims.
“Failure in some of these areas contributed to more children experiencing actual abuse and many others being exposed to the risk of sexual abuse.”
The report makes a number of recommendations, including mandatory safeguarding training for all staff and volunteers, and for the Catholic Safeguarding Advisory Service to be externally audited.
It said the subject of mandatory reporting – the legal duty to report allegations of child sexual abuse to the appropriate authorities, something Catholic Church leaders have opposed due to the “sacred nature” of disclosure made during confession – will form part of the inquiry’s final, overarching report into abuse allegations across society.
One survivor who gave evidence before the inquiry said of the report: “The head of a church should have the greatest morals of all, but instead they were sending paedophiles to other areas of the country – and America – in an attempt to cover the abuse up. How ‘Christian’ is that?

“It was bad enough being abused in the first place but then to have it dismissed and covered up just takes even more of a toll on you.”
Richard Scorer, specialist abuse lawyer at Slater and Gordon representing survivors at the inquiry, said: “This is an absolutely damning report.
“Cardinal Nichols needs to go right away – in any other walk of life he would be gone immediately.
“This is a church that cannot be trusted to protect children.”
The inquiry also criticised the Holy See – the Pope and the offices of the Catholic Church based in Rome – for a lack of cooperation during the investigation.
The findings chime with a separate report by the IICSA last month, which said the Anglican Church failed to protect vulnerable children from sexual predators for decades, instead prioritising its own reputation.
The remaining avenues of the inquiry are due to hear evidence later this year, before a final report of overarching findings from all 15 sections of the investigation is laid before Parliament in 2022.","It found Cardinal Nichols “seemingly put the reputation of the church” above his duty to sex assault victims.",20,0,2,16594,"Nov 10th 2020, 2:43 PM"

Thiago Osorio Cortes (28), from Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil, was cycling on North Wall Quay in Dublin when he was struck by a car at about 10.30pm on 31 August last.
Cortes, who was a student, was delivering food for Deliveroo at the time of the collision.
He was taken by ambulance to the Mater Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.
A teenage boy was arrested on Friday and detained in Store Street Garda Station under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.
He was remanded in custody by the district court after he was charged with dangerous driving causing death of Cortes and failing to report the occurrence of an injury to gardaí.
He was remanded in custody to the Oberstown detention centre and appeared today at the Children’s Court.
Detective Sergeant John Brady applied for an adjournment to obtain directions from the DPP.
Defence solicitor Aoife McNicholl pointed out that the teen had presented himself to a garda station on 2 September last, and since then gardaí had time to get the directions.
Detective Sergeant Brady said the DPP still does not have the full file which was still in garda possession, “and we are trying to advance it as much as possible”.
The boy, who was accompanied to court by his parents, did not address the court.
Judge Marie Quirke said in dealing with a juvenile case there was a duty on the State to progress the matter with due expedition, in the interests of justice.
The defence consented to a two-week adjournment.
Judge Quirke further remanded the teen in custody to appear again on 24 November next.

The DPP’s directions will outline whether the case should go forward to the circuit court which has tougher sentencing powers. The boy has not yet indicated how he will plead.
He cannot be named because he is a minor.
Section 93 of the Children Act states that no report shall be published or included in a broadcast which reveals the name, address or school of any child concerned in the proceedings or includes any particulars likely to lead to the identification of any child concerned in the proceedings.

There are only two ways that a judge, short of death or retirement, can leave office. First, he or she can resign, which is, as the Chief Justice stressed, entirely for the individual judge to decide.
Secondly, the judge can be impeached in the Houses of the Oireachtas for “stated misbehaviour” or incapacity. 
The impeachment process has never been carried out; judges have stepped down before the process could be undertaken.
In 1999, following a scandal known as the Sheedy Affair, the government announced it was considering moving impeachment motions for two judges alleged to have committed misconduct by intervening in the progress of a criminal case. Both judges resigned.
In the mid-2000s, a motion of impeachment was moved against Circuit Court Judge Brian Curtin, who was charged with possessing child pornography, though ultimately acquitted due to a defective search warrant. Judge Curtin resigned before the motion was brought to a vote.
In 1941, a motion of impeachment was moved against a Circuit Court judge by reason of incapacity, but this was withdrawn when the judge agreed to retire.
How would impeachment work?
Under the Standing Orders, a motion is moved in a House of the Oireachtas calling for a judge’s removal. If the House does not want to reject the motion outright, a Select Committee is formed to investigate and report on any alleged misconduct, and the House then votes on the impeachment, hearing from the judge and/or his representatives first. Fair procedures must be followed throughout this process.
The real question that arises from this concept is that it is not defined in the Constitution or in any Act, or in any judgment of the courts. The misbehaviour must be “stated”, that is, there must be a clear articulation of the alleged misconduct.
But there is no guidance on what that misconduct has to be. Does it have to be criminal misconduct; a breach of the law; conduct related to the administration of justice? The Constitution does not say. The Attorney General is being consulted, and will presumably advise the government on this point. 
There is a credible argument that the Oireachtas gets to determine this in the manner that it thinks fit; that is, misbehaviour is what the Oireachtas thinks is sufficient to remove a judge.
There is probably some limit on this: the courts have said that they could examine the impeachment process to make sure there had not been “clear disregard” of the Constitution. But once the Oireachtas made a good faith determination that there had been sufficient misbehaviour, it is unlikely that the courts would intervene. 
Options available to Oireachtas
So how should the Oireachtas make a determination as to whether Judge Woulfe’s conduct reaches this standard? Though there is no formal guidance, there are several places that politicians might look to. 
The Judicial Council Act 2019, though not fully in force, provides some instruction. It does not define the constitutional concept of stated behaviour, but it does define “judicial misconduct” as breaching acknowledged standards of judicial conduct, and in so doing, bringing the administration of justice into disrepute.
We can also look abroad to how other countries have characterised judicial misbehaviour in the context of removal from office.
For example, in 1997, the Solicitor General of New Zealand advised that misbehaviour means ‘conduct that is [so] morally wrong and improper that it demonstrates a judge lacks the integrity to continue to exercise judicial office’.
He rejected that the concept could be defined around public confidence in the administration of justice alone.

In 2006, the Privy Council, the highest court of the Commonwealth, considered the notion of misconduct in relation to the Chief Justice of Gibraltar and focused much more on the ability of the judge to stay in office following the misconduct. 
The Privy Council suggested that it was relevant if the conduct affected directly his ability to carry out the duties functions of the office, or adversely affected the view of others that he could carry them out; if it would be contrary to the administration of justice for the judge to remain in office; and if the office had been brought into disrepute by the actions of the judge.
Reasoning from these standards, could we conclude that Judge Woulfe’s conduct reaches the threshold for impeachment? There are several potential difficulties.
First, as former Chief Justice Denham noted in her Report, there is no clear standard of conduct for judges in place in Ireland (though one is being drawn up by the new Judicial Council at present). This means that it is hard to define the standards of conduct that Judge Woulfe departed from. 
Secondly, as the Chief Justice noted in his letter, it is not Judge’s Woulfe’s actions in attending the dinner alone that are problematic, since no law was broken and public health advice was no knowingly violated. It is the combination of his failure of judgement in respect of the dinner and his subsequent reaction to the controversy that has caused the problem.  
This included, perhaps, a failure to understand and take responsibility for his actions, and his remarks about the government and other judges made to Judge Denham and revealed in the transcript.
But this means that his misbehaviour is diffuse, and hard to pin down. It is not a single action but a series of actions and attitudes that created this issue.
Options available to Woulfe
Judge Woulfe can potentially claim that it is unfair to hold him to a standard of conduct that is vague and not clearly set out in advance.
On the other hand, if we focus on the administration of justice, it is clear that Judge Woulfe’s conduct has undermined it.
That the President of his Court would take the unprecedented step of publicly commenting that, in his view, he should resign, and his Court unanimously feel that serious and irreparable damage has been caused by the effect of his actions, could be seen to rise to the standard of stated misbehaviour.

Our lack of clear codes of judicial conduct, and lack of definition of the core constitutional concept of stated misbehaviour, leave us navigating without maps in this situation.
It will be for our politicians to decide if they believe Judge Woulfe’s conduct reaches the constitutional threshold for using the extraordinary power of impeachment, something that should not be done lightly. It would appear to us that there is at least a reasonable case either way.

Joe Biden has been projected to win the election overall by decision desks in US media outlets after achieving the minimum 270 electoral votes, but the full picture for each state across the country remains unfinished.
Some states are still too close to call, or not enough votes have been counted to make a decision on the winner. 
Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Alaska have yet to be called by many US media outlets with counts still ongoing. 
Let’s take a look at the current situation with the count in these states. 
Arizona

You might be confused to see Arizona on the list, but votes are still being counted in this state despite being called by some media outlets early in the game. 
Fox News and the Associated Press called the race for Biden on Election Night (early Wednesday morning Irish time), triggering Trump’s wrath in a speech that night.
Other media outlets, such as The New York Times and CNN, have not yet declared a winner in Arizona, a traditionally Republican state. 
AZ Central said in recent hours that there are an estimated 61,500 ballots left to verify and count, with many of those being provisional ballots that may or may not be verified. 
Biden is currently ahead with a lead of just .45% ahead of Trump, according to state results.  
Trump won the state in 2016 over Hillary Clinton by a margin of 3.5%.

Georgia has progressed into a swing state after consistently voting Republican since 1996.  
Trump was initially in the lead in Georgia, but this margin was slowly chipped away as main-in votes were counted in urban areas like Atlanta. Biden overtook him on Friday. 
Currently, Biden is in the lead by just 0.23% with more than 98% of votes counted, according to state election data. 
On Friday the Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger called for a full recount of votes in the state as Biden was in the lead by just over 1,500 votes overall.
Trump won Georgia in 2016 with a lead of more than 5% in the state with 16 electoral votes. 
The state will prove to be critical in January as it is the only state holding elections for both its Senate seats, which will determine which party is in control of the Senate. 
The race has gone to two runoffs which will be held on 5 January.

Another traditionally Republican state, pundits had been keeping an eye on this state from the beginning.
Trump won North Carolina in 2016 by a margin of 3.66%. Projections ahead of the vote said Clinton would win by less than 1%. 
With around 98% of the votes counted so far, Trump is ahead of Biden by just under 1.4%. This state has 15 electoral votes.

Although not the most significant state with just three electoral votes, not enough votes have yet been counted to call the race in Alaska. 
Just 61% of votes have been counted so far due in part to the logistics of collecting ballots in the vast but most sparsely populated state in the US.
Officials also cross-reference absentee ballots to ensure nobody voted twice.
It’s not a close race however, with Trump currently in the lead with 62.2% of the vote so far, according to the New York Times.

941,193,"After firing his defence secretary, Trump reportedly wants FBI and CIA chiefs gone too",https://www.thejournal.ie/donald-trump-fires-mark-esper-5261967-Nov2020/,"US PRESIDENT DONALD Trump fired Defence Secretary Mark Esper yesterday, further unsettling a government facing uncertainty over the US president’s refusal to concede election defeat to Democrat Joe Biden.
Coming with just 10 weeks left in his White House tenure, the move heightened concerns that Trump might take aim at other national security officials with whom he has expressed disappointment.
Democratic Senator Mark Warner, Vice-Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he “deeply troubled” by Trump’s firing of Esper “just 72 days before a new president will be inaugurated and during a growing global pandemic”.
In a statement, Warner said: “There is no doubt that our adversaries are already seeking vulnerabilities they can exploit in order to undermine American global leadership and national security during this transition period.”
He added that the transfer of power from Trump to Biden “should be peaceful”.
“The last thing that our country needs is additional upheaval in the institutions designed to protect our national security. President Trump must not invite further volatility by removing any Senate-confirmed intelligence or national security officials during his time left in office.”
Retired General Barry McCaffrey told MSNBC firing Esper is an “unusal move” by Trump and one that people should be worried about.
“This signals that Mr Trump does not see himself as Commander in Chief for only a few more months. It makes no logical sense whatsoever to fire somebody who is highly qualified with literally weeks until you turn over this office,” McCaffrey said.
“We ought to be apprehensive about what’s going on,” he added.
Trump named Christopher Miller, head of the National Counterterrorism Center, as acting defence secretary.

Miller is a retired 31-year army veteran who deployed in Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003 with the special forces. He was Trump’s White House advisor on counterterrorism, and served as deputy assistant secretary of defence for special operations from January to August 2020.
FBI and CIA
According to multiple reports, Trump is also believed to be considering dismissing FBI Director Chris Wray and CIA Director Gina Haspel, angered that they did not support his battle for reelection.

Retired admiral James Stavridis, the former Nato supreme allied commander, said that Trump is “playing with fire with our nation’s security”.
“If Trump moves on to fire the head of the CIA and the head of the FBI, both true professionals and patriots, we are going to be in uncharted waters for the next 90 days,” Stavridis wrote on Twitter.
The Washington Post reported that Trump had already removed the official in charge of the programme that produces the government’s climate change reports, a move that would allow him to be replaced by someone with views closer to Trump’s scepticism about global warming.
Below the radar
Esper was Trump’s fourth defence chief in four years, and his removal capped a stormy relationship between the Pentagon and the president.
Like his predecessors, Esper, 56, sought to fly below the political radar to avoid Trump’s ire.

But they ultimately collided over White House pressure to deploy federal troops to quash civil unrest, and Trump’s desire for a rapid withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan before the defence establishment felt it was safe.
“Mark Esper has been terminated,” Trump declared abruptly on Twitter yesterday.
“I would like to thank him for his service.”
Funding the border wall
Esper, who was a classmate of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at military academy West Point, worked for years in the defence industry before joining the Pentagon as army secretary in 2017.
He became defence secretary in July 2019, and pursued fundamental reforms to the massive Pentagon bureaucracy and sought to reshape the US global defence posture to focus on China.
Esper accommodated some of Trump’s wishes, launching a separate Space Command and, when Congress would not fund it, moving billions of dollars from weapons and base maintenance programmes for construction of a wall on the US-Mexico border to block illegal immigrants.
He also sharply cut US forces in Syria as Trump sought to live up to his 2016 election pledge to bring back troops from overseas.
‘Preserving my integrity’
But even as he skirted controversy, Esper could not avoid colliding with the commander in chief.
After sometimes violent anti-racism protests spread across the country following the May police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Trump sought support from the Pentagon for deploying regular troops.

Both Esper and Joint Chiefs Chairman General Mark Milley made clear they disagreed with the idea, reportedly infuriating Trump, who later publicly demeaned the Pentagon chief as “Yesper”.
More tension came in June when Trump announced, reportedly without informing Esper, that he would halve the number of US troops in Germany.
And then, Trump pressed for a faster drawdown of US forces from Afghanistan than originally planned after the 29 February US-Taliban peace deal.
Esper quietly but stiffly pushed back, insisting that the level will stay at 4,500 troops after this month, until the Taliban follow through on pledged reductions in violence.
In an interview last week with Military Times that was held in anticipation of his removal, Esper said he had defended the Pentagon as an institution while “preserving my integrity in the process”.
“Name another cabinet secretary that’s pushed back,” he said.

The US-educated Erekat was involved in nearly every round of peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians going back to the landmark Madrid conference in 1991, when he famously showed up draped in a black-and-white chequered keffiyeh, a symbol of Palestinian nationalism.
Over the next few decades, Erekat was a constant presence in Western media, where he tirelessly advocated for a negotiated two-state solution to the decades-old conflict, defended the Palestinian leadership and blamed Israel for the failure to reach an agreement.
Erekat’s Fatah party announced his death in a statement.
A relative and a Palestinian official later confirmed the news.
As a loyal aide to Palestinian leaders – first Yasser Arafat and then Mahmoud Abbas – Erekat clung to this strategy until his death, even as hopes for Palestinian statehood sank to new lows.
Abbas said Erekat’s death was a “great loss for Palestine and our people, and we feel deeply saddened by his loss, especially in light of these difficult circumstances facing the Palestinian cause”.
Erekat “will be remembered as the righteous son of Palestine, who stood at the forefront defending the causes of his homeland and its people”, Abbas added, saying flags will be flown at half-mast for three days.
Yossi Beilin, a former Israeli cabinet minister and peace negotiator, called Erekat’s death “a big loss for those who believe in peace, both on the Palestinian side and the Israeli side”.
Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said Erekat was a “leading voice for Palestinians and for peace”. 
His willingness to engage and talk when it was not always easy or popular was a clear demonstration of his belief that through dialogue and negotiation, even the most difficult issues could be resolves. 
“His contribution to peace, including the Oslo Peace Process, is testament to that,” Coveney said. 
“I met with Dr Erekat on many occasions during my visits to the region and in Dublin, when he accompanied President Abbas on his visit in 2018. We spoke regularly and I was always impressed by his commitment, which we share, to a just and lasting peace,” he said. 
“While Dr Erekat’s vision for peace was not achieved during his lifetime, it is for all of us in the international community to honour that commitment by working together for a pathway for peace in the Middle East,” Coveney added. 
I would like to extend my sympathies to his family and friends at this very difficult time, and to the Palestinian community in Ireland who will mourn his loss. 
Saeb Erekat’s life
Erekat was born on 28 April 1955 in Jerusalem. He spent most of his life in the occupied West Bank town of Jericho, and as a child he witnessed Palestinians fleeing to nearby Jordan during the 1967 war in which Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.
He studied abroad, earning a BA and MA in international relations from San Francisco State University and later moved to the UK, completing a PhD at the University of Bradford, where he focused on conflict resolution.
When he returned to the West Bank he became a professor at An-Najah University in Nablus and an editor at the Al-Quds newspaper. A self-described pragmatist, he invited Israeli students to visit the university in the late 1980s and condemned violence on all sides.
He was nevertheless convicted of incitement by an Israeli military court in 1987 after troops raided the university and found an English-language newsletter he had authored in which he wrote that “Palestinians must learn how to endure and reject and resist″ all the forms of occupation.
Erekat insisted he was advocating peaceful resistance and not armed struggle, and he was later given an eight-month suspended sentence and fined £4,700.
The first Palestinian uprising erupted later that year in the form of mass protests, general strikes and clashes with Israeli troops. That uprising, along with US pressure on Israel, culminated in the Madrid conference, widely seen as the start of the Middle East peace process.
Erekat was a prominent representative of Palestinians living inside the occupied territories at the time, but became a close aide to Arafat when the exiled Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) returned to the territories following the 1993 Oslo accords.
In subsequent years he routinely served as Arafat’s translator, and was sometimes accused of editing his remarks to soften the rough edges of the guerrilla leader-turned-aspiring statesman.
#OPEN JOURNALISM No news is bad news Support The Journal Your contributions will help us continue to deliver the stories that are important to you
SUPPORT US NOW
Throughout the 1990s, Erekat was a frequent guest on news programmes, where he condemned violence on both sides but warned that the peace process was at risk of collapse because of Israel’s refusal to withdraw from the territories.
Erekat was part of the Palestinian delegation at Camp David in 2000, when US president Bill Clinton brought the two sides together for marathon talks aimed at reaching a final agreement. The talks ended inconclusively and a few months later a second and far more violent uprising erupted.
Arafat died in in 2004 but Erekat continued as a top aide to Abbas and served as a senior negotiator in sporadic peace efforts in the late 2000s.
Erekat resigned as chief negotiator in 2011 after a trove of documents was leaked to the pan-Arab broadcaster Al-Jazeera showing that the Palestinian leadership had offered major concessions in past peace talks that were never made public.
But Erekat remained a senior Palestinian official and a close adviser to Abbas, who later appointed him secretary general of the PLO.
Israel and the Palestinians have not held substantive talks since Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in 2009.
But Erekat continued to call for a two-state solution based on the 1967 lines, accusing the Israeli leader of putting a “nail in the coffin” of hopes for peace by continuing to expand settlements.
Erekat is survived by his wife, two sons, twin daughters and eight grandchildren.

It follows a two-year Commission investigation into the company’s dual role as a marketplace for sellers and also as a competitor, often selling the same products.
The Commission is alleging that the Jeff Bezos-owned company “systematically” uses the business data of third-party sellers who use its platform “to the benefit of Amazon’s own retail business”.
This “non-public” data includes the number of ordered and shipped units of a given product as well as the number of visits to sellers’ offers.
Its investigation into Amazon’s business practice uncovered evidence that Amazon then uses this data — which the Commission said is “widely available to employees of Amazon’s retail business” — to tailor its own retail offerings.
Regulators came to the “preliminary view” that these practices allow the company “to avoid the normal risks of retail competition and to leverage its dominance in the market”. 
Speaking at a press conference this morning, Margrethe Vestager, European Commissioner for Competition, said that the preliminary conclusion of the investigation is “that Amazon illegally abused its dominant position as a marketplace service provider in Germany and France, the biggest market basis for Amazon in the European Union”.
“Today the Commission has sent a statement of objection to Amazon, with the preliminary conclusions that Amazon illegally distorted competition in online retail markets,” Vestager said.
Vestager explained, “Amazon has a dual role as a platform”.
“On the one hand, it operates a marketplace to allow for third-party sellers to offer products to consumers,” she said
“On the other hand, Amazon is also a retailer on its own platform. So, Amazon directly competes with third-party sellers that rely on its platform… This model marginalises third-party sellers and limits their ability to grow.” 
‘Buy Box’
The Commission has also today opened a second investigation into other aspects of Amazon’s business including the ‘Prime’ label and the company’s ‘Buy Box’.
The latter is a white box on the right side of the Amazon product detail page, where customers can add items for purchase to their cart. 
According to the Commission, “Winning the ‘Buy Box’ (i.e. being chosen as the offer that features in this box)… is crucial to marketplace sellers”.
The concern is that the metrics Amazon uses to determine which seller wins the box gives “preferential treatment” to sellers that use its own logistics and delivery services.

“Looking into Amazon’s data use revealed that Amazon may have set certain rules on its platform that artificially favours both its own retail offers, as well as the offers of sellers that uses Amazon’s logistics and delivery services,” Vestager said. 
Vestager said that the Commission wants to ensure that sellers who do not use Amazon’s own systems are able to “compete on their own merits” and also that the can move to other marketplaces without being “locked into the Amazon ecosystem”.
Amazon is the latest ‘Big Tech’ company to be tackled by EU regulators.
Her office has also fined Google more than €8bn over competition issues and ordered Apple to repay €13bn in taxes to the Irish government.
Both companies appealed those decisions.

The game was then postponed due to Covid-19 cases in the French squad and now the Six Nations has confirmed that the game – along with Italy v Scotland and Wales v Scotland – has been cancelled.
“Recent Government and Health Authority restrictions affecting squad preparations, travel, and the inability to stage matches due to the sport’s amateur status have made the successful completion of the 2020 championship impossible,” reads a statement from the Six Nations.

However, the postponement of this year’s Rugby Europe Women’s Championship – which Spain are the strong favourites to win – has now had a knock-on effect for the European Qualifier.
“With the Covid-19 situation in Europe presenting continued travel and quarantine challenges for some teams, the decision was made to postpone and identify an optimal opportunity for the tournament to be rescheduled in early 2021,” said World Rugby and Rugby Europe in a joint statement.
It all leaves Ireland in an uncertain position but they are vowing to make the best of the situation.
“Covid-19 has been disruptive for so many people and from the start of the pandemic we set out to be flexible and dynamic in our response to ever-changing circumstances,” said Anthony Eddy, the IRFU’s director of women’s rugby.
“The squad has been positive through all of this and will continue to work hard to improve. We have been focusing on the Qualifiers for well over a year now and that will not change. 
“The group achieved three home Six Nations wins in 2020 which is an excellent outcome, and this additional time will allow more preparation in qualifying for the 2021 World Cup.
“The squad has a busy schedule and our plan will slightly change – they will regroup and competition for spots will intensify as we all focus on preparation for 2021.” ","The game against France has now been cancelled but the Qualifiers are set to take place next year.",1,0,0,13606,"Nov 10th 2020, 11:42 AM"
948,189,"Many European countries running out of ICU beds amid surge in Covid-19 cases",https://www.thejournal.ie/icu-beds-europe-covid-5261848-Nov2020/,"MANY COUNTRIES IN Europe are running out of intensive care beds amid a surge of coronavirus cases – as well as the doctors and nurses required to staff them.
In Italy, queues of ambulances can be seen parked outside hospitals awaiting beds for patients, while in France the government coronavirus tracking app prominently displays the intensive care capacity taken up by Covid-19 patients: 92.5% and rising.
In the intensive care unit (ICU) in Barcelona, there is no end in sight for the doctors and nurses who have endured this situation already.
In country after country, the intensive care burden of Covid-19 patients is nearing and sometimes surpassing levels seen at last spring’s peak.
Health officials, many advocating a return to stricter lockdowns, warned that adding beds will do no good because there are not enough doctors and nurses trained to staff them.
In France, more than 7,000 health care workers have undergone training since last spring in intensive care techniques.
Nursing students, interns and paramedics have all been drafted, according to French health minister Olivier Veran.
“If the mobilisation is well and truly there, it is not infinite,” he said last week, when the ICU units were filled to 85% capacity.
“It is not enough.”
Within days, the capacity had jumped another seven percentage points and Veran warned it would continue to rise.
And, unlike in the first wave last spring, the virus is now everywhere in France, making transfers from one region to another by high-speed train less practical.

One hospital in the southern city of Marseille recently wheeled in refrigerated rental trucks ahead of a feared rise in ICU deaths there.
In Italy, Filippo Anelli, the head of the national doctors’ association, said at the current infection rate, there soon will not be enough physicians to go around.
Recently in Naples, nurses started checking on people as they sat in cars outside emergency rooms, waiting for space to free up.
Italy has a total of 11,000 ICU beds, but only enough anaesthesiologists for 5,000 patients, Anelli said. As of yesterday, 2,849 ICU beds were filled nationwide – up 100 from just the day before.

For the average coronavirus patient with serious symptoms, it takes seven to 10 days to go from infection to hospital admission.
Those admitted often need to stay for weeks, even as more patients arrive. The maths is inexorable as long as infection rates rise.
Patients from France and the Netherlands are being evacuated to German intensive care units, but German doctors say they are watching the number of free beds dwindle quickly.
Dr Uwe Janssens, who heads Germany’s Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine, said some urban areas are reaching precarious levels.
He said: “When a city of millions only has 80, 90 beds left then that can be a critical mass, because you don’t just have Covid-19, there are also traffic accidents, heart attacks, pulmonary embolisms and so forth.”
In the past two weeks alone the number of coronavirus patients treated in ICUs in Germany has almost tripled, from 943 to 2,546.

However, Dr Janssens acknowledged that the situation in Germany is better than that in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and the UK.
Germany has about 34.5 ICU beds per 100,000 inhabitants, not including the emergency reserves. Italy has 10, while France has 16, he said.
“But a bed, a ventilator and a monitor doesn’t mean the patient can be cared for,” he added. “When it comes to nurses and specialist staff, Germany is far behind.
“We have a lot of beds but we don’t have enough staff for them.”

Spain has the same limitations, but had endured coronavirus deaths already on a scale Germany has yet to experience.
Dr Robert Guerri, head of the infectious diseases department and coordinator of Covid-19 admissions at Hospital del Mar in Barcelona, said: “On the one hand, the health workers are tired; on the other hand, the number of people that are working on the front line is limited.”
His coronavirus unit filled up in October, then the critical care unit filled up. Even with the rate of infection easing slightly, he does not know when any of those beds will be free.
In neighbouring Portugal, Fernando Maltez has 40 years of experience preparing contingency plans for health threats as one of the country’s leading infectious disease experts. This one is different.
In the seven months from early March through the end of September, Portugal officially counted more than 75,500 cases of Covid-19. In the month of October alone, it counted almost 66,000.
In all, 391 coronavirus patients were in Portuguese ICUs as of yesterday, when the country imposed a curfew. During the worst week last spring, the ICUs had 271 coronavirus patients.
“There’s no end in sight,” Maltez said at the infectious disease ward he oversees at Lisbon’s Curry Cabral Hospital, where 20 ICU beds set aside for coronavirus patients are now all occupied.

“No health service in the world can withstand a deluge of cases that just keeps coming.”
Much of Eastern Europe, which was spared the harrowing wave last spring, is in the same position.
Hungary warned its ICU would run out of space by December under the worst-case scenario, and hospital cases in Poland have risen to three times the levels seen in the spring.
Late last month, American National Guard troops with medical training headed to the Czech Republic to work alongside doctors there, while the mayor of Prague took shifts at a hospital.
However, there are a few signs of hope.
Belgium, proportionally still the worst-hit nation in Europe when it comes to coronavirus cases, is seeing increasing indications of a turning point in the crisis after a partial lockdown.
Virologist Yves Van Laethem said hospital admissions seem to have peaked at 879 on November 3, and fell to about 400 on Sunday.
There were fears that the 2,000-bed ICU capacity would be reached last week, but Steven Van Gucht, a virologist with the Sciensano government health group, said the pace was slowing there as well.

950,189,"Thousands seek domestic violence support services for first time during Covid restrictions",https://www.thejournal.ie/domestic-violence-services-covid-5261802-Nov2020/,"AROUND 3,450 women and 589 children contacted a domestic violence service for the first time seeking support and safety from abuse and coercive control during the first six months of Covid-19, research shows.
This equates to 575 “new” women and 98 “new” children every month, or 19 new women and three children every day.
A new report from Safe Ireland, called Tracking the Shadow Pandemic, shows these women and children accounted for 29% and 24% respectively, of all those who looked for support from a domestic violence service during the first wave of the Covid-19 crisis.
In total, at least 1,970 women and 411 children received support from a domestic violence service every month over the period.
The tracking study is based on data collected monthly by Safe Ireland from its frontline member services, which is continuing through Ireland’s second lockdown.
Mary McDermott, co-CEO of Safe Ireland, the national hub for 39 frontline domestic violence services, said: “The study exposes, yet again, patterns of domestic violence heightened by this pandemic.
“It also underscores the enormous strains that services throughout the country were under, and continue to endure, as they deal with the impact of lockdown two.”
While the government said it will prioritise domestic violence, McDermott said this has not been backed up by the resources and infrastructural modernisation that is needed.
The six-month report also shows that 33,941 helpline calls were answered across the country over the period, amounting to an average of 184 calls every day.
Compared to 2018, domestic violence services responded to an average of 147 calls a day.
On average, there were 191 women and 288 children staying in domestic violence accommodation, including refuge, safe homes and supported housing, each month.
At the same time, 1,351 requests for refuge – or seven requests per day – could not be met as there was no space, the report found.

McDermott added: “Since the start of Covid-19 the government has prioritised domestic violence and we have always welcomed this.
“But calling something a priority means that it also has to be name-checked in the national budget, and funded and resourced as a priority.
The number of new women and children who came forward during the first lockdown is eye-opening and indicative of the depth of hidden abuse and trauma in this country.
“Our member services have pulled out all the stops to respond to the increasing and complex needs of women and children since March.
“But this is on top of decades of coping with impossible conditions and demands. They are at breaking point now and can no longer be expected to work, without clarity, without adequate resources and within an antiquated infrastructure.”
Safe Ireland said that the data collected reflects the anecdotal stories reported by services from March and August.
Mirroring what Safe Ireland initially referred to as an ominous silence, the number of women accessing services decreased by 8% between March and April as lockdown restrictions came into full effect.
However, since April, the numbers have steadily increased month on month.

951,189,"UK government vows to press on with Brexit bill despite Lords defeat",https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-government-brexit-bill-lords-defeat-5261794-Nov2020/,"KEY PARTS OF Boris Johnson’s controversial Brexit legislation have been rejected by the Lords.
Peers moved to strip controversial clauses from the UK Internal Market Bill that would enable ministers to break international laws.
The Lords voted 433 to 165, majority 268, to reject law-breaking powers after fierce criticism by Tory former leader Michael Howard and Tory ex-chancellor Ken Clarke.
The government immediately responded by insisting it would not back down.
A government spokesperson said: “We are disappointed that the House of Lords has voted to remove clauses from the UK Internal Market Bill, which was backed in the House of Commons by 340 votes to 256 and delivers on a clear Conservative manifesto commitment.
“We will re-table these clauses when the Bill returns to the Commons.
“We’ve been consistently clear that the clauses represent a legal safety net to protect the integrity of the UK’s internal market and the huge gains of the peace process.
“We expect the House of Lords to recognise that we have an obligation to the people of Northern Ireland to make sure they continue to have unfettered access to the UK under all circumstances.”
Peers went on to inflict a further defeat on the government by 407 votes to 148, majority 259, stripping out a further contentious clause relating to the Northern Ireland Protocol.
All other controversial provisions were removed without votes.
Labour’s leader in the House of Lords, Baroness Angela Smith said: “I am sure some in government will initially react with bravado and try to dismiss tonight’s historic votes in the Lords. To do so, however, would underestimate the genuine and serious concerns across the UK and beyond about ministers putting themselves above and beyond the rule of law.
“The government should see sense, accept the removal of these offending clauses, and start to rebuild our international reputation.”
The move came after Tory former prime minister Sir John Major said the government’s plan to override key elements of the Brexit deal hurt Britain’s global reputation.
Sir John condemned Johnson’s position, insisting it was “unprecedented in all our history – and for good reason”.
Sir John said the UK Internal Market Bill, which ministers have admitted will breach international law, had “damaged our reputation around the world”.
Asked about the Lords votes, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney told BBC2’s Newsnight the UK government’s stance had “undermined trust”.
He said:
It is not a surprise to us as an Irish government that the Internal Market Bill, or part five of the Internal Market Bill, is essentially being rejected by the House of Lords.
And, it’s as controversial a piece of legislation as it seems, within the UK as it is outside of the UK.
Coveney added: “Effectively, what the Prime Minister is proposing to do with this legislation is to deliberately threaten to break international law by passing domestic legislation which effectively says if the EU doesn’t give us what we want in the negotiations around the implementation of the withdrawal agreement, and, in particular, the protocol on Northern Ireland and Ireland, well, then we are going to legislate to give British ministers the powers to do what they want to do anyway.
“And that has been a tactic that really has undermined trust in these negotiations.”

US relationship
The Prime Minister’s stance could risk creating early tensions with US president-elect Joe Biden.
Biden warned during his successful campaign against Donald Trump that a trade deal with the US was “contingent” on the prevention of a return to a hard border on the island of Ireland.
Johnson has insisted that the Bill is designed to “protect and uphold the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process in Northern Ireland”.
Biden, who is proud of his Irish heritage, has warned the agreement cannot “become a casualty of Brexit”.
Meanwhile, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier was in London yesterday to resume trade talks with Downing Street counterpart Lord Frost.
Barnier tweeted that he was “happy to be back” in the capital, with the two teams “redoubling our efforts” for an agreement.
He listed the three major sticking points – governance, the level playing field and fishing policies – as the three “keys to unlock a deal”.
Time is fast running out to have a deal in place by the end of the transition period on 31 December, with businesses fearing the high trade tariffs they would face in the absence of an agreement.","Minister Simon Coveney told BBC2’s Newsnight the UK government’s stance had “undermined trust”.",7,0,0,25679,"Nov 10th 2020, 7:42 AM"

The dictionary said it added the term because it “encapsulates the shared experience of billions of people who have had to restrict their daily lives in order to contain the virus”.
Collins’ lexicographers registered over a quarter of a million usages of “lockdown” during 2020, against only 4,000 the previous year.
According to the dictionary, lockdown is defined as “the imposition of stringent restrictions on travel, social interaction, and access to public spaces”.
It came into common parlance as government’s around the world responded to the spread of Covid-19 in early 2020.
Collins’ annual 10-strong list of additions is dominated by words and phrases relating to the pandemic, including “furlough”, “key worker”, “self-isolate” and “social distancing”.
“Coronavirus” itself also features.
“Key worker” has seen a 60-fold increase in usage reflecting the importance attributed to professions considered to be essential to society.
Social and political upheavals such as the Black Lives Matter movement and the withdrawal of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex from royal duties also influence the list.
Following the death of unarmed black man George Floyd in the US, the abbreviation “BLM” features after registering an increase in usage of 581% by Collins.
“Megxit”, which is modelled on the word “Brexit” – Collins’ Word of the Year 2016, makes the list following Harry and Meghan’s move to the US.
“TikToker” describes someone who shares content on the TikTok social media platform, while “mukbang” originated in South Korea and describes a host who broadcasts videos of themselves eating a large quantity of food.

The brand had fallen behind in the market to rival Burger King, which was the first to launch a vegetarian version of its iconic Whopper burger in April 2019 in the United States.
Other chains like Dunkin’ or Starbucks have also dipped their toes in the plant-based market, as consumers become more aware their health, the impact of livestock farming on the environment and animal rights.
McDonald’s had already tested out a plant-based burger in Canada in cooperation with the company Beyond Meat, which specialises in vegan meat substitutes.
Such substitutes, like soya, have existed for a long time but new companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Burger have developed products that closer resemble meat in taste, texture and color.
The new line will be produced exclusively for McDonald’s, and will be introduced in selected markets next year.
The restaurant chain has not yet said if it will renew its collaboration with Beyond Meat, only saying it will reach out to third-party suppliers as with all its other products.
Beyond Meat shares plunged on Wall Street on the announcement, down 25% at 10.40pm in electronic exchanges following the close of the New York Stock Exchange.
McDonald’s told investors it was also considering plant-based substitutes for chicken products and for its egg and bacon breakfast sandwiches.
“We are excited about the opportunity because we believe we have a proven, delicious-tasting product,” said Ian Borden, who heads McDonald’s international operations.

McDonald’s still relies on its flagship products like the Big Mac, McNuggets and chips, which account for around 70% of its sales in its main markets.

Nagorno-Karabakh has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a 1994 truce ended a separatist war in which an estimated 30,000 people died.
Sporadic clashes have occurred since then, and full-scale fighting began on 27 September.
Several cease-fires had been called but were almost immediately violated. However, the agreement announced early today appeared more likely to take hold because Azerbaijan has made significant advances, including taking control of the strategically key city of Shushi on Sunday.
Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian said on Facebook that calling an end to the fight was “extremely painful for me personally and for our people”.
Soon after the announcement, thousands of people streamed to the main square in the Armenian capital Yerevan to protest the agreement, many shouting, “We won’t give up our land”.
Some of them broke into the main government building, saying they were searching for Pashinian, who apparently had already departed.
The agreement calls for Armenian forces to turn over control of some areas it held outside the borders of Nagorno-Karabakh, including the eastern district of Agdam.

That area carries strong symbolic weight for Azerbaijan because its main city, also called Agdam, was thoroughly pillaged, and the only building remaining intact is the city’s mosque.
Armenians will also turn over the Lachin region, which holds the main road leading from Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia.
The agreement calls for the road, the so-called Lachin Corridor, to remain open and be protected by Russian peacekeepers.

955,236,"Sexton: Later team selections, less of 'The Bibs', and little moments driving Ireland",https://www.the42.ie/johnny-sexton-5-5261548-Nov2020/,"FOR ANDY FARRELL, there is a fine line between building squad depth and disappointing players like his captain who have their eyes fixed not on a grand scheme, necessarily, but on Friday and another chance to do right by their international jersey.
And the fact that Johnny Sexton’s eyes pierced in the direction of the coaches’ box following his withdrawal in Paris last Saturday week will mean that, when Ireland take to the field against Wales, all eyes will inevitably be on the Leinster out-half regardless of the fact that he and Farrell extinguished that spark before it became a fire.
Sexton is, in 2020, a lightning rod for such scrutiny and such is his standing within Irish rugby, one can envisage the cameras giving him similar airtime to his prospective deputy even he was to watch Ireland’s Autumn Nations Cup campaign kick-off from the Aviva stands.
“I always feel, personally, that I have a point to prove because you can be the best thing since sliced bread one day and then everyone writes you off the next — and it’s the same with every part of your game,” he says. “Even at times going well, you’ve got that nagging doubt in your head.”
At least, these days, if there is a doubt as to his claim as Ireland’s starting out-half, the 35-year-old can put it to bed for another week internally even while such discourse rages on publicly.
Some things will never change, but Monday and Tuesday this week will be a little bit different under Farrell’s gaze than they were under predecessor Joe Schmidt.
“The competition in training is big. We’re going at it team-against-team and guys are fighting for places.
“That’s going to spur us on, that’s going to make us better.
It is probably a little bit different to how it used to be in terms of, at the start of the week the team [was] picked and it was very much ‘The Bibs’, we used to call them, would prep the starting team. But at the moment, the start of the week is competition-based. It’s Monday and Tuesday this week of going at each other and then trying to get that jersey.
“It’s good because it brings the standard of training up and guys are ready come Friday. No matter who gets picked or who gets called upon, if it’s a late change or anything, guys are ready.”
Front and centre of Farrell’s selection dilemma this week, irrespective of the extent to which he wishes to shuffle his deck, will be the back three, which Sexton labels “a strong area of competition with “quality across the board”.
Keith Earls is fit again but must now contend with the newly qualified James Lowe as well as Hugo Keenan, albeit many have mooted the Leinster young gun may be due a run-out at fullback where Jacob Stockdale’s defensive errors proved costly at the Stade de France despite some decent cameos in attack.
An uncapped Munster man may yet have something to say about that, however.

“You consider someone like Keith Earls: he’s missed the first two games but he has looked sharp,” Sexton says.
“Shane Daly has been impressive in training, so there are lots of new faces. Shane, James Lowe; Hugo has obviously been very good in the first couple of games. Earlsy is still hanging around and impressing in training.
“Look, whatever back three we put out there, we’ll be confident in whoever gets picked because they’ve all got certain qualities that you want in an international back three.”
On Friday, Ireland face neighbours from across the Irish Sea who find themselves at a lower ebb than Farrell’s men, with Welsh head coach Wayne Pivac admitting on Monday that it was he who took the decision to ostensibly sack defence coach Byron Hayward following Wales’ worst Six Nations in 13 years. They have won just two of seven games since Warren Gatland’s departure, and have suffered five defeats on the spin on either side of sport’s hiatus due to the coronavirus.
A reminder that it could be worse, but equally that turnarounds in fortune — in either direction — can be swift.
“Even in the year Wales won the Grand Slam, it feels like about four years ago but it was only like the 2019 Six Nations,” Sexton says. “The margins in those games — like the first game against France in that campaign, a couple of tries towards the end swings it for them. Moments in that England game… You’re always at a certain level with each international team and often, it comes down to small moments in games.
You even look at our game last weekend against France: we have big regrets but we’re one foot away from scoring a try before half-time. We turn the ball over. You score that and the game is different, maybe. Maybe the game totally changes in that moment. So, they’re the things that we speak about all the time and the small things that make a difference.
“Wales will know that they’re not too far away. They could have easily won a couple of games that they lost in the Six Nations but they’ll have that siege mentality this week and we know they’ll come together stronger than ever.”

Some Republicans, including Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, rallied behind Trump’s efforts to fight the election results.
Few in the party acknowledged Joe Biden’s victory, or condemned Trump’s other controversial move yesterday – his firing of Defence Secretary Mark Esper.
The developments cast doubt on whether the nation would witness the same kind of smooth transition of power that has long anchored its democracy.
The Electoral College is scheduled to formally confirm Biden’s victory on December 14 and the Democrat will be sworn into office in late January.
Barr has authorised the Justice Department to investigate “substantial” allegations of voter irregularities and election fraud, though no widespread instances of that type of trouble exist. In fact, election officials from both political parties have publicly stated that voting went well. International observers also confirmed there were no serious irregularities.
Biden campaign lawyer Bob Bauer said Barr’s memorandum authorising investigations “will only fuel the ‘specious, speculative, fanciful or far-fetched claims’ he professes to guard against”.
Biden pressed forward with plans to build his administration, assembling a team of experts to face the surging pandemic. But the federal agency that needs to greenlight the beginnings of the transition of power held off on taking that step. And the White House moved to crack down on those not deemed sufficiently loyal as Trump continued to refuse to concede the race.

Trump remained out of sight at the White House, with conversations ongoing about how the defeated president would spend the coming days and weeks as he challenged the people’s verdict.

The former reality TV star is not expected to formally concede but is likely to grudgingly vacate the White House at the end of his term, according to several people around him.
Also being discussed is the possibility of more campaign-style rallies as Trump tries to keep his supporters fired up despite his defeat. It was possible they would feature his family and prominent supporters, but not the president himself.
The removal of Esper, the Pentagon chief, was expected by some aides to be the first of several firings by Trump. Others believed to now be vulnerable include FBI Director Christopher Wray, CIA head Gina Haspel and infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci.
The president was given cover to keep fighting by McConnell, seen by many in the GOP as the person who may eventually need to nudge Trump to the exit.
“We have the system in place to consider concerns and President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options,” McConnell said.
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer countered that the Republicans’ refusal to accept the election results was “extremely dangerous, extremely poisonous to our democracy”.
Adding to the sense of uncertainty, the General Services Administration (GSA) held off on formally beginning the transition, preventing Biden’s teams from gaining access to federal agencies.

A GSA spokesman said late on Monday an “ascertainment” on the winner of the election had not yet been made. Citing the agency’s response to the extended 2000 electoral recount, it signalled that it may not do so until Trump concedes or the Electoral College meets next month.

On a call with reporters last night, a transition official said the Biden team believed it was time for the GSA administrator to ascertain Mr Biden is president-elect. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said legal action was “certainly a possibility” if that did not, though there are also other options being considered.
Across the government, there were signs of a slowdown.
White House officials and Trump political appointees informed career government staffers they were not to begin acting on transition planning until the GSA approved it, according to officials familiar with the matter.
But some elements of the federal government were mobilising to prepare for Biden to assume power. The US Secret Service and Federal Aviation Administration extended a flight restriction over Biden’s Delaware home through Inauguration Day. Also, Biden’s security detail has been bolstered with agents from the Presidential Protective Division.
Legal challenges already have been dismissed in battleground states like Georgia and Wisconsin. And Trump’s legal efforts were dealt another blow Monday when campaign adviser David Bossie, tasked with leading the effort, tested positive for the coronavirus.
Bossie had been at the indoor White House election night party now being perceived as a possible super-spreader event after other attendees — including chief of staff Mark Meadows, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson and other aides — contracted the virus.
Trump’s public schedule hasn’t included an intelligence briefing since Oct. 1. The White House hasn’t provided a “readout” of any call between the president and a foreign leader in weeks. He hasn’t met with members of the White House coronavirus task force in months. He also offered no public comment on Tropical Storm Eta lashing the Florida Keys.","The defeated president has blocked co-operation with Joe Biden’s team, while electoral investigations have been authorised.",22,0,0,54225,"Nov 10th 2020, 6:53 AM"

By age 17, one third of teenagers reported to having had sexual intercourse according to data in the report obtained from the Growing Up in Ireland ’98 cohort.
Furthermore, nearly a quarter of young people expressed regret over the timing around when they first had sex, rising to 31% for young woman compared to 16% of young men.
Study co-author Emer Smyth said its findings show “a significant group of young people are not receiving information or advice on sex from their parents”, which makes learning about sex and relationships in school “all the more important”. 
At age 13, 45% of young people reported that they had discussed sex and relationship issues with their parents. This rose to 60% by the time they reached the age of 17.
In school, 55% of young people said they’d received relationships and sexuality education in school by age 13, rising to 92% of young people by age 17.
At age 13, parents/family were the main source of information about sex, but by age 17 friends were the most commonly cited source (at nearly 50%).
At age 17, nearly a quarter of young men and a fifth of young women said that the internet/TV/books/films were the main source of information. 
Around 60% of young men said they found it difficult or very difficult to talk to their fathers about sex.
Among those who’d reporting having sex, 90% said they’d used contraception the first time they had sex. Young people who’d discussed sex with the parents at age 13 were significantly more likely to have used contraception the first time they had sex, researchers said.

Smyth added: “The findings support the current move towards considering sexual wellbeing as part of broader school efforts to support young people’s wellbeing.”
For those who were sexually active, just under 80% reporting always sing contraception and 56% reporting using a condom “all the time”. 
Moira Germaine, education and training manager at the HSE’s Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme, said: “What parents do matters; this is confirmed by the finding that parent-child communication about relationships and sexuality in the early adolescent years was associated with contraception use when the children became sexually active as young adults.
Not only can parents have this specific protective influence, they can also help their child to develop all the attitudes, values and behaviours necessary for forming and maintaining healthy relationships, including, in adulthood, healthy sexual relationships.
Germaine added that the HSE was today introducing a range of resources aimed at supporting parents in talking with their children about sexuality, relationships and growing up. They are available to order for free from www.healthpromotion.ie or download from www.sexualwellbeing.ie.","The findings are included in a report published today by the HSE and ESRI.",2,0,1,16771,"Nov 10th 2020, 6:20 AM"
958,183,"It's transition time, but how does it work and when will Biden pick his team?",https://www.thejournal.ie/biden-transition-5260978-Nov2020/,"WE NOW KNOW that Joe Biden will become US President on 20 January 2021, but there is much that can and will happen before that.
For obvious reasons, this period is known as the presidential transition and it is seen as an indication of how the incoming president intends to govern.
During the process, the new administration prepares to assume control of government departments, with the president nominating some or all of their cabinet during this period also.
Whether transitions are smooth and amicable or difficult and disagreeable largely depend on the people involved, but US law dictates that much of the work can be done non-politically.
The Presidential Transition Act of 1963 essentially means that career civil servants working in the various departments have significant power in transferring data and expertise to incoming officials.
This law is designed to reduce potential political fighting by taking some of the transition-related activities away from incoming and outgoing officials.
In addition, there is also the non-partisan Center for Presidential Transition that has already urged Donald Trump’s outgoing administration to “immediately begin the post-election transition process” as laid out under the act.
Despite this however, Reuters explains that the transition process cannot shift into high gear until the government’s General Services Administration (GSA) certifies the winner.
Until then, the GSA can continue providing Biden’s team with offices, computers and background checks for security clearances, but they cannot yet enter federal agencies.
The Associated Press reports that the GSA’s Trump-appointed administrator, Emily Murphy, has not started the process of formally recognising the President-elect.
Biden has already gone about beginning the process however, with the President-elect launching a transition website called ‘Build Back Better’. The website lists a number of priorities for the incoming administration, with Covid-19 as the first such priority.
Biden yesterday launched a Covid-19 advisory board that he says will help guide the transition team in planning for the President-elect’s federal response to the virus.
On the campaign trail, Biden promised to “take the muzzle off our experts” and put a national strategy in place to “get ahead” of the virus and end the pandemic crisis.
Also on the Biden-Harris Transition Team website, it lays out that the team is to be “co-chaired” by Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.
It doesn’t name any other individuals but it is likely that the team will be fleshed out over the coming days and weeks.

What exactly does US President-elect Joe Biden plan to do?
Four years ago, then-governor of New Jersey Chris Christie had been chair of Trump’s transition team before he was jettisoned when his involvement in a local scandal was revealed.
During the Trump transition in late 2016, much of the business was apparently carried out from Trump Tower, with the comings-and-goings from Trump’s New York base closely watched by the media.

Among those to visit Trump during that period were former vice president Al Gore and rapper Kanye West. There was also the meme-worthy dinner Trump had during his transition with Reince Priebus and Mitt Romney.
Of those four, only Priebus became part of Trump’s administration, serving as the first of four chiefs of staff Trump had during his presidency.
A White House Chief of Staff is one of the major appointments Biden will have to make as he takes up office, but he will also have to go about selecting a cabinet.
Unlike the Chief of Staff, cabinet nominations will have to be approved by the US Senate.
The new Senate is not due to sit until January so no nomination hearings will not be heard until mid-January at the earliest, but the nominations themselves could be made in the coming weeks.  
Crucially, there are still four seats of the 100 seats in the Senate that remain unfilled, with Democrats and Republicans currently holding 48 each.

Of the four that remain, votes are still being counted in two of them, with two others to be decided by head-to-head-elections in Georgia on 5 January.
Those two run-off votes could decide the balance of power in the Senate, and if Republicans again have a majority they could slow Biden’s cabinet nominations.
The balance of power could even influence Biden’s picks, with the President-elect perhaps eager to avoid bruising confirmation battles should he make choices that could anger Republicans.
The question over who Biden chooses for his team has already provoked debate within the Democratic Party, with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez telling the New York Times that transition appointments would “send a signal of who the administration credits with this victory”.","It’s 71 days until Biden’s inauguration, so there’s much to be done.",2,0,0,11627,"Nov 10th 2020, 6:00 AM"

BORIS JOHNSON HAS suffered a major defeat over his controversial Brexit legislation, as peers staged votes to strip out powers that would enable ministers to break international law.
Conservative former leader Lord Howard of Lympne led the calls for the Prime Minister to “think again” and remove the contentious parts of the UK Internal Market Bill, warning that the Government is using the language of “law breakers” everywhere.
Cross-party amendments were tabled to strike out clauses linked to the most contentious part of the Bill, namely part five, which gives ministers the power to breach the Brexit divorce deal – known as the Withdrawal Agreement – brokered with Brussels last year.
The House of Lords voted 433 to 165, majority 268, to remove section 42 – one of the disputed clauses – and section 43 was removed without a vote.
This was the first of two expected votes to remove the relevant sections that make up part five.
Ministers have insisted powers to override the Withdrawal Agreement are needed to protect the relationship between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but critics argue the powers are not necessary.
Baroness Angela Smith, Labour’s leader in the House of Lords, said in a statement: “I am sure some in Government will initially react with bravado and try to dismiss tonight’s historic votes in the Lords.
“To do so, however, would underestimate the genuine and serious concerns across the UK and beyond about ministers putting themselves above and beyond the rule of law.
The Government should see sense, accept the removal of these offending clauses, and start to rebuild our international reputation.
Peers went on to inflict a further defeat on the Government by 407 votes to 148, majority 259, stripping out a further contentious clause relating to the Northern Ireland Protocol.
All the other controversial provisions were removed without votes.
Legislation
The legislation aims to make changes to how trade will operate within the UK after it leaves the EU’s Single Market and Customs Union. This includes making decisions on Northern Ireland that are contrary to the Withdrawal Agreement it ratified this year.
Cross-party amendments were tabled to strike out clauses linked to the most contentious part of the Bill, ‘Part Five’ which gives a British minister the power to breach the Withdrawal Agreement and make unilateral decisions in relation to Northern Ireland without consulting the EU.
Peers were expected to take the unusual step of holding votes at committee stage (marked by a ‘C’ on this graphic) to remove these sections of the Bill, rather than waiting for report stage at the end of the process, signalling the level of opposition to the measures.
Ministers have insisted powers to override the Withdrawal Agreement are needed to protect the relationship between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but critics argue the powers are not necessary.
Speaking ahead of the expected votes, Howard said “nothing has changed” since Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis admitted the Bill breaks international law in a “very specific and limited way”.
He said: “Since then, as far as I’m aware, no government minister has sought to resile from his words.
“Instead, what ministers have done, both in your Lordships’ House and elsewhere, is to seek to make the case that circumstances make it expedient to break international law.
Isn’t that what lawbreakers always say? Isn’t that the excuse of lawbreakers everywhere? What sort of a precedent is the government setting when it admits that position?
How can we reproach other countries – Russia, China, Iran – if their behaviour becomes reprehensible when we ourselves have such scant regard for the treaties we sign up to, when we ourselves set such a lamentable example?
Brexit-backer Howard went on: “There have been some suggestions that opposition to this part of the Bill is in some way the last charge of the Remainers.
“That suggestion has a very dangerous implication for those who advance it.
“It implies that only those who voted for us to remain in the European Union care about the rule of law, or the importance of keeping one’s words, or the sanctity of international treaties.
“Fortunately, I am in a position which enables me confidently to contradict that implication. I voted and campaigned for Brexit and I do not for one moment regret or resile from that vote.

“But I want the independent sovereign state that I voted for to be a country which holds its head up high in the world, that keeps its word, that upholds the rule of law and that honours its treaty obligations.”
Other contributions
Many unionists feel “deeply frustrated” about the proposed trading arrangements between Northern Ireland and Great Britain at the end of the transition period, Nigel Dodds said.
The DUP’s former Westminster leader told the Lords: “Just as it is unacceptable to nationalists to have that border on the island of Ireland, it is equally unacceptable to create barriers between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.
“That is why we feel strongly that some of the emphasis on the Belfast Agreement that has been made in this House and other places has I think erred somewhat to emphasise one side of the situation.
Many, many unionists feel deeply, deeply frustrated and angry tonight in Northern Ireland about the way in which it’s OK to have a free border north-south but you can do whatever you like east-west.
“We must come to sensible, pragmatic arrangements.”
Independent crossbench peer Igor Judge, a former head of the judiciary, advised the House of Lords should be “neither complicit nor supine” and should vote against clauses in the Bill.
Richard Newby, Liberal Democrat leader in the Lords, added: “If we can’t take a view on a matter of deliberate law-breaking by the government we may as well pack up our bags now.”
Tory Baroness Noakes said the Bill was a “responsible approach by the Government to protect the interests of the UK but particularly the interests of Northern Ireland”.
Tory former lord chancellor Lord Mackay spoke of his “shock” over the British government’s move and insisted the rule of law was a fundamental part of the UK’s constitutional arrangements.
Tory Lord Cormack said the law-breaking clauses in the Bill must go and threatened to vote against them “again and again” if necessary.","Conservative former leader Lord Howard of Lympne led the calls for the Prime Minister to ‘think again’.",8,0,0,46518,"Nov 9th 2020, 8:42 PM"

CHIEF JUSTICE FRANK Clarke has said he believes that Supreme Court judge Seamus Woulfe should resign his position in the wake of the controversy caused by the Golfgate dinner.
The Attorney General has been asked to advise the Taoiseach and Government on the Chief Justice’s view, following the release of letters between the two judges this evening.
It’s understood that Cabinet will discuss the matter relating to Woulfe’s attendance at the dinner, which broke Covid-19 regulations and led to the resignations of Agriculture Minister Dara Calleary and EU Commissioner Phil Hogan, tomorrow.
In a letter released this evening, Clarke told Woulfe: “Regrettably, however, I believe that I should make clear my personal opinion that, to avoid continuing serious damage to the judiciary, you should resign.”
Woulfe, however, has indicated that he will not be resigning.
He has told Clarke that he “does not consider it in any way appropriate that [he] should resign”. 
Woulfe has been told he will not be listed to sit on the court until February – having only been appointed during the summer – and Clarke has “strongly suggested” that arrangements should be made to waive or repay his salary for that period. 
A meeting took place between the pair last Thursday, but details on that event and its aftermath weren’t issued until late this evening. 
In a letter dated 5 November, Chief Justice Clarke told Woulfe: “It is my view, and the unanimous view of all of the members of the Court (including the ex-officio members), that the cumulative effect of all of these matters has been to cause a very significant and irreparable damage both to the Court and to the relationship within the Court which is essential to the proper functioning of a collegiate court.
It is not part of my role to ask, let alone tell, you to resign. Resignation is and can only be for the judge him or herself. Regrettably, however, I believe that I should make clear my personal opinion that, to avoid continuing serious damage to the judiciary, you should resign. I asked you to reflect on this. You have indicated that you do not intend to resign.
Clarke said that it was not an offence to attend the controversial Oireachtas Golf Society dinner but that “a judge should not attend any event which is organised in breach of the law or where there may be a reasonable public perception that this is so”.
The two judges were due to meet on four separate occasions in October, but the planned meeting was postponed and eventually cancelled. Woulfe requested a postponement for “personal reasons” at first, and then later on “medical grounds”.
That meeting was part of the “informal resolution” that was recommended in a report to deal with Woulfe’s attendance at the Golfgate dinner, which resulted in the resignation of Dara Calleary as Agriculture Minister and Phil Hogan as the EU’s Trade Commissioner.
The review into Woulfe’s attendance at the dinner by former chief justice Susan Denham found it would be “unjust and disproportionate” for the judge to resign.
You can read Clarke’s latest letter to Woulfe here. 
However, further controversy ensued after transcripts of an interview given by Woulfe to Denham in the course of the review were later released, and described media coverage of the scandal as “appalling” “overblown” and “fake”, with claims the social event was treated like the “Ku Klux Klan”.
In correspondence to Woulfe, Chief Justice Clarke said that the details from the transcripts of Woulfe’s meeting with Denham has “caused even greater damage to the judiciary than did your attendance at the Clifden event”.
He said that Woulfe’s account to Denham put the controversy down to a media frenzy.
Clarke added: “Indeed, your statement that you did not understand what you were apologising for at the time when you issued your limited apology would now significantly devalue any further apology. There would be legitimate public scepticism about the genuineness of any such apology.”
Woulfe’s letter
In a letter to Clarke dated today, Woulfe acknowledged that the perception that he broke Covid-19 guidelines has unintentionally had a negative impact on the image of the judiciary and the Supreme Court, and apologises for this.
But he told the Chief Justice that he is determined to co-operate with the court to remedy the situation.
“I do not consider it in any way appropriate that I should resign,” Woulfe wrote.
He said he believed that an “informal resolution” of the matter proposed by Clarke meant that the two would meet informally to discuss the issues about his attendance at the dinner, but said this meeting had never taken place.
He wrote:
It is, on any view, surprising that something so serious as a Chief Justice calling on a fellow member of the Supreme Court to resign (and, apparently, intending to do so publicly) should occur without the Chief Justice even discussing the matter in advance with the Judge in question or hearing what the Judge might have to say on a point of significant concern to his livelihood, his reputation and his mental health…
Woulfe also said in his letter that although he accepted it was inappropriate for him to have attended the dinner, he argued that Clarke was incorrect to assert that the dinner did not comply with Covid-19 regulations in place at the time.
“I do not think it is fair to criticise me by saying I did not respect such guidelines in circumstances where I was simply not aware,” he said.
“It was simply a matter of fact. I attended a dinner in a room with 45 people, not 80 people.”
Woulfe further noted that the Supreme Court had accepted Susan Denham’s report into his attendance at the event, and said he did not think it was fair to characterise his defence or use of an engineer’s report as a “concentration on narrow and technical issues”.
However, he accepted that he did not appreciate the genuine public concern over the dinner and instead attributed it to “a media frenzy”.

“If that is the impression I have given, I am sorry for that and that is certainly not the impression I intended to create,” he wrote.
“My point was that the entirely understandable public concern and, indeed, outrage, was based on the assumption that I had attended a dinner in a room with 80 people and that I did so knowing that it was, or must have been, in breach of the relevant Covid regulations and guidelines.”
Woulfe later denied making any public criticism of the government in his interview with Denham, saying his only comments were that Agriculture Minister Dara Calleary was not asked to give an account of his movements to the Taoiseach.
He also said he was “under the most intense pressure, personally, physically and emotionally” and said the comments made were in private at a time when he was “fighting for [his] professional life and reputation”.
He further denied implying that his colleagues on the Supreme Court had “pre-judged” his fate.
“I am sorry if any of my colleagues took offence at either the apprehension of pre-judgement that I expressed to Ms Justice Denham, or at the fact that I found my meeting with them to be upsetting and traumatic and said so,” he wrote.
“The fact of the matter is, however, that I did find the content and tone of the meeting both upsetting and traumatic.”
Woulfe had earlier volunteered to offer a month’s salary to charity, and responded to a suggestion by Clarke to waive or repay his salary for the three months in which he would not be listed to hear cases that he would accept this if it would resolve the issue.
Clarke’s letter today
In his final letter to Woulfe today, Chief Justice Clarke said he would be publishing the details of this correspondence as he considered this action “necessary in the public interest”. 
Clarke said that while Woulfe had expressed regret and offered an apology, this was somewhat “undermined by [his] apparent insistence that nothing [he has] done merits reprimand, criticism or apology and indeed [his] continuing desire to place responsibility elsewhere”.
The Chief Justice went on: “I very much regret that we have arrived at this situation. However, I feel that I have no alternative to expressing my opinion in circumstances where, while suggesting that you will apologise and make amends, you maintain that you did little wrong.
I do not think that sufficient to restore public confidence… Finally, I should say that, regrettably, I remain of the view, expressed at our meeting and in the draft letter, that you should resign. 
I note that you have reaffirmed the view expressed at our meeting to the effect that you will not resign. I do appreciate that this has been a most stressful time and am glad that you recognise that the views which I have come to are not borne out of ill will but rather my genuine assessment of the situation.

STORMONT MINISTERS HAVE failed to reach agreement on a potential extension of circuit-break coronavirus restrictions in the North.
Ministers in the powersharing executive are due to resume discussions on Tuesday morning.
Extensive talks on Monday failed to produce an outcome, with ministers at odds on whether to extend some or all of the measures for a further two weeks.
The executive initially adjourned the meeting on Monday morning to seek further data on the likely impact of easing some restrictions.
They reconvened in the early evening for further talks. A breakthrough did not materialise, with ministers set to resume at 11am.
A four-week circuit-break lockdown that has forced the closure of much of the hospitality sector in Northern Ireland is due to end at midnight on Thursday.
With hospitals still under sustained pressure dealing with Covid-19 admissions, ministers are set to extend some of the restrictions for a further two weeks.
However, they are considering relaxing some measures. It is understood these could allow cafes and restaurants to reopen, but without alcohol being sold.
However, there are doubts whether ministers will press ahead with this option, as it is understood discussions on Monday evening acknowledged concerns raised by the hospitality sector.
Representatives from the sector insisted that the inability to sell alcohol would make trading unviable.
Leading Belfast restaurateur Michael Deane called the proposal “crazy”.
“Where does that leave us to go?” he asked. “Absolutely devastating and I think it is criminal, I think it is absolutely stupid.”
Other critics of the measures being considered by the DUP/Sinn Fein-led coalition included DUP MP Ian Paisley.
He accused the executive of taking decisions for the “optics”, in order to make the administration look good.
Paisley questioned the evidential basis for claiming the ban on alcohol in restaurants would drive down infection rates.
“It’s like saying you can open a hairdresser but you can’t use a comb,” he told the BBC.
“Seriously, what’s the evidence for that?”
It is understood the executive is also considering extending the closure of pubs that do not sell food for a further two weeks.

Ministers are also assessing whether close-contact services, such as hairdressers and beauticians, could be allowed to resume, as long as strict restrictions are observed.
At Monday’s remote executive meeting, which lasted about an hour and 20 minutes, ministers requested further analysis on these proposals.
It is understood chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride and chief scientific adviser Professor Ian Young then worked to pull together evidence related to the specific moves.
Ministers reconvened this evening to consider the information.
The DUP favours a relaxation of the current restrictions.
It is understood Sinn Fein is content to extend many of the restrictions but wants to see some easements, particularly for those working in close contact services.
Ministers are under pressure to come to an agreed position to give businesses time to prepare for potential changes on Friday.
It is understood they are assessing whether close-contact services, such as hairdressers and beauticians, could be allowed to resume as long as strict restrictions are observed.

Gardaí today arrested a male suspect, who was detained at Kilmainham Garda Station under Section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act 1939. A firearm, believed to be an imitation weapon, was also seized and sent for analysis.
The man has now been charged in relation to the robbery and is due to appear before the Criminal Courts of Justice tomorrow morning.

The senior Republican’s first public comments since the result was declared came as the president’s allies on Capitol Hill have been reluctant to congratulate Joe Biden or push Trump to accept the outcome.
McConnell said the process will play out and “reach its conclusion”.
Trump has declined to concede the presidential race and is mounting legal fights, but there has been no indication or evidence of voter irregularities or widespread fraud in the election.
“Our institutions are actually built for this,” McConnell said as he opened the Senate.
“We have the system in place to consider concerns and President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options.”

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said the Republicans’ refusal to stand by the election results is “extremely dangerous, extremely poisonous to our democracy”.
He said election lawsuits can be valid but they must be based on evidence and facts.
“Joe Biden won the election fair and square,” Schumer said.
While some Republican state officials invoked the Trump mantra that only “legal votes” should be counted, others emerged to counter the campaign narrative and urge voters, and perhaps the president, to support the results.
“The process has not failed our country in more than 200 years, and it is not going to fail our country this year,” said Republican senator Susan Collins, who won her re-election bid in Maine and has congratulated Biden on his victory.
Across the country, Republicans have complained about problems with the signatures, secrecy envelopes and postal marks on ballots, the inability of their poll watchers to scrutinise them and the extensions granted for mail-in ballots to arrive.
However, judges largely rejected the Republican challenges as the campaign sought to interrupt the vote count as it leaned towards Biden.","The president’s allies have been reluctant to congratulate Joe Biden on his projected win.",6,0,0,51801,"Nov 9th 2020, 9:57 PM"
965,193,"Azerbaijan apologises to Russia after shooting down helicopter as fighting rages over Karabakh",https://www.thejournal.ie/azerbaijan-russia-helicopter-5261612-Nov2020/,"AZERBAIJAN ACCIDENTALLY SHOT down a Russian military helicopter in Armenia as fighting raged over Nagorno-Karabakh today, threatening to draw Moscow further into the conflict.
The defence ministry in Moscow said two crew members were killed when the Mi-24 helicopter was hit by a man-portable air defence system close to the border with Azerbaijan.
A third crew member was injured and evacuated, it said.
Azerbaijan quickly admitted to having shot down the helicopter by accident and apologised.
“The Azerbaijani side offers an apology to the Russian side in connection with this tragic incident,” the foreign ministry said in a statement, adding the move “not aimed against” Moscow.
Azerbaijan said the decision was made to open fire on the helicopter due to the “tense situation in the region and increased combat readiness” after six weeks of fierce clashes with Armenia-backed separatists for control of Nagorno-Karabakh.
The helicopter was shot down near the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, a landlocked exclave of Azerbaijan between Armenia and Turkey, far from Nagorno-Karabakh.
Russia has a military pact with Armenia and a base in the country, but has so far insisted it would not get involved in the conflict with Azerbaijan unless Armenian territory itself came under threat.
Ferocious fighting continued over Nagorno-Karabakh on Monday, with conflicting reports of whether Azerbaijani forces had managed to capture the disputed region’s key town of Shusha, known as Shushi in Armenian.
‘Persistent battles’
Armenian officials insisted battles for the town were ongoing, with Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan saying: “The fighting for Shushi continues.”
The Armenian government said there were “persistent battles” in recent days and that separatist forces “confidently defended and are defending the fortress city of Shushi”.
But Vahram Poghosyan, a spokesman for Karabakh’s separatist leader, posted on Facebook that Armenian forces had lost control of Shusha, a strategically vital town that is the region’s second-largest.
“We have to admit that a chain of failures still haunts us and the city of Shushi is completely out of our control,” Poghosyan said.
“The enemy is on the outskirts of Stepanakert,” he said, referring to the region’s main city, “and the existence of the capital is already in danger.”
Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev announced on Sunday his forces had taken Shusha, which lies around 15 kilometres from Stepanakert and on the main road to Armenia.
Aliyev said on Twitter twitter that his forces had managed to capture 48 more settlements in Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian enclave that broke away from Azerbaijan’s control during a bitter war in the 1990s.
Fresh fighting over the region erupted in late September and Azerbaijani forces have been able to make substantial gains, sweeping across the region’s southern flank and into its heartland.
Mounting anger in Armenia
Anger appeared to be mounting in Armenia over the military losses, with 17 opposition parties on Monday calling on Pashinyan and the rest of his government to immediately resign.

The parties — including several of the country’s largest political groupings — said in a statement that Armenia’s leaders bore “the entire responsibility for the situation” in Karabakh.
“The authorities have lost their moral and political basis to represent the people,” they said.
Karabakh declared independence nearly 30 years ago but the declaration has not been recognised internationally, even by Armenia, and it remains a part of Azerbaijan under international law.
The recent fighting has been the worst in decades, with more than 1,000 people reported killed including dozens of civilians and the real death toll is believed to be much higher.
The clashes have forced thousands to flee their homes leaving Stepanakert a ghost town devastated after weeks of shelling.
The longstanding ex-Soviet rivals have left three recent ceasefire agreements brokered by the United States, Russia and France in tatters.
The three countries co-chair the “Minsk Group” that helped broker a truce in 1994 but has failed to mediate a lasting resolution to the long-simmering territorial dispute.
Diplomatic efforts appeared to ramp up over the weekend as fighting intensified near Shusha, with Russian President Vladimir Putin speaking Saturday to Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan and President Emmanuel Macron of France.
Turkey is a key ally of Azerbaijan and its involvement would be key to any agreement to halt the fighting.

WHEN GRÁINNE MCELWAIN was first announced as the new presenter of Sky’s GAA coverage for the 2020 season, she thought she was heading for the comforts of a warm studio.
Sky Sports GAA presenter Gráinne McElwain.
Source: Brendan Moran/SPORTSFILE
The Monaghan native had been brought in as the new anchor having clocked up 15 years of sports broadcasting service for channels like eir Sport, RTÉ and TG4.
During that time, she’s been exposed to all sorts of inclement weather while working pitch-side at GAA games. Nothing surprised her about the mood wings in the Irish climate. Even the seasonal bouts of sunshine you expect in the summer time haven’t always turned up for her.
It’s still early doors for this year’s GAA championship which was delayed by Covid-19, but McElwain is well off the mark in the driver’s set of Sky’s coverage.
The ongoing threat of the virus means the use of an indoor studio is off limits, and McElwain must keep a two-metre distance from the analysts during the live broadcasts.
At a time when the GAA has been through a major shake-up, Sky’s GAA coverage has brought McElwain back to her roots.
“I’m used to being outside in all types of weather,” she tells The42. ”In that respect, it doesn’t really change very much for me.
In terms of being at the matches, it’s such an honour and a privilege to be there and it’s eerie not having fans, but you can just tell how much all the games mean to the players and the management.
“You can hear how vocal they are on the sideline, and you can hear what they’re saying.”
Presenter Joanne Cantwell is out in the fresh air too for the Sunday Game’s offering of live games. Their outdoor set is more noticeable than normal on TV due to the lack of a crowd, but they’ve used it at plenty of venues in the past.
Similar to McElwain, she’s already experienced some horrible weather conditions at matches in this year’s championship.
RTÉ’s flagship GAA programme picked up the Munster SHC semi-final between Limerick and Tipperary last weekend, a game which was marred somewhat by the persistent rain.
Cantwell was also on presenting duty for yesterday’s epic Munster SFC semi-final where Cork sensationally dumped Kerry out of the championship with a last-minute goal from Mark Keane.
The game was played in biblical levels of rain. Clouds of mist formed at times during the match, while the live television signal dropped momentarily due to the unrelenting conditions. 
You might think that she’s still trying to get her body temperature back to a normal level after those two bitterly wet days, but Cantwell assures that it wasn’t as bad as it looked.
“That is a question I’ve been asked so many times since the previous weekend. But the funny thing is that it was reasonably mild both those days, especially the first day.
For the time of year, it was actually pretty mild. It was insanely mild but it wasn’t that cold. I have several layers that I bring everywhere with me and different levels of warmth. I’ve been in way colder, and I’m going to be in way colder in the next few weeks.
“For some reason, I suppose it was really, really stormy but the weather seemed to really catch everybody’s eyes.”
That’s not to suggest that the conditions haven’t had any impact on her this season. She says that she was preparing her notes for the half-time chat of one of the games, only to see that they had “disintegrated into about five different pieces” due to the rain.
As for that shock result in Páirc Uí Chaoimh yesterday, Cantwell says that she didn’t quite believe Kerry could lose until the dying embers of the game.
They didn’t get to hear the normal roar of applause that follows such a result at the final whistle, but she was able to appreciate the intimate celebrations among the Cork players on the pitch.
I remember I turned around with about five minutes of extra-time to go and Colm Cooper was the one closest to me. I said, ‘Colm, do you think Kerry could actually lose this game?’ And he looked at me and said, ‘Yeah, I do.’
“But I never… Even though it was all square at the end of the 70 minutes and even though there was only a point it at half-time in extra-time, it never occurred to me that Kerry would actually lose, until about five minutes to go.

“And then when the goal went in, there was just this gasp of utter shock. It was a brilliant moment, what a way to win a game. A terrible way to lose a game.
“And we could actually hear them, I don’t know if they were screaming or cheering behind us at one stage. There may have been no fans there but you could still get this feeling coming from the Cork players as they were out on the pitch afterwards, which was brilliant.”
For both Cantwell and McElwain, they only have minor adjustments to make in fulfilling their jobs under Covid conditions.
Filling out health questionnaires, wearing masks and arriving to matches earlier than they usually would are among the key steps they have to take.
But both Sky and RTÉ have implemented many changes in the background to ensure their reformatted coverage runs smoothly.
“Behind the scenes, the adjustments they’ve had to make have been monumental, ” Cantwell explains, “particularly for the Sunday Game night programme.
“Last night, they had 13 different games across football, hurling and camogie. Some nights, it can get to over 20.
“In the past, you’d wander into the outside broadcast trucks to say hello but you can’t go near it now because you’re not allowed into it. The only people allowed in there and are the ones who are assigned to it and they obviously have all the screens there.
You think we’re bad outside, all the doors and windows are wide open in the trucks. So whatever cold wind is blowing, is blowing into them.”
Speaking about her own experience of Sky’s outside broadcasts, McElwain says:
“Once you’re inside, you’re inside. You can’t really go out very much and do other things. You’re there a bit earlier but in terms of the practicalities of getting mic’d up, ear pieces and microphones – we have our own individual one and we bring it with us every week.”
When asked about their general feeling towards being at the coalface of the GAA coverage this year, both presenters say they feel grateful and lucky to be there.
They’re among the few who can actually attend the games, while loyal fans all over the country are forced to watch the games from home. Losing the luxury of an indoor studio is a small price to pay for that privilege. 
“How many people in this county would swap positions with me in a heartbeat, and they wouldn’t care,” says Cantwell.
Do you want to be in a stuffy studio watching the game on the tele or do you want to be out? I wouldn’t care if it was a blizzard, I’d happily stand there if I got to see Cian Lynch and Noel McGrath going head to head.
“I would bite your hand off to be there rather than be sitting inside somewhere.”

TG4 says: “This documentary explores the remarkable circumstances of his visit. Immediately after resigning as French president in April 1969, de Gaulle fled to the small town of Sneem in Kerry seeking peace and solitude – but he didn’t get it.
“A horde of international paparazzi descended on the town and besieged the general in his hotel, and the documentary features interviews with local people who share anecdotes of this extraordinary time. It also explores de Gaulle’s fascination with Daniel O’Connell and reveals how his visit to O’Connell’s home at Derrynane, County Kerry, helped him come to terms with his inner turmoil.”

969,190,"Concern about Denmark's mutated coronavirus strain as testing begins at Irish mink farms",https://www.thejournal.ie/mink-strain-ireland-5261625-Nov2020/,"HEALTH OFFICIALS HAVE said precautionary measures have been put in place amid concerns about a coronavirus variant discovered in Danish mink farms.
At the weekend, the government said anyone arriving from Denmark to Ireland will be asked to restrict their movements for two weeks.
Testing at the three mink farms in the country has begun to see whether the virus is present in Irish minks. The Department of Agriculture said serial testing of all workers at these farms and their household contacts will also take place.
This evening, Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan said NPHET had a risk assessment meeting on Friday and met over the weekend to identify measures to put in place on a precautionary basis in Ireland. He said communications have been sent to frontline clinicians to raise awareness around the importance of travel history in relation to Denmark.
Announcements about self-isolation recommendations are to be made on flights and points of entry for travellers arriving from Denmark. Anyone suspected of having this variant will have their test sent to the National Virus Reference Laboratory (NVRL) for genome sequencing.
He said the ECDC is expected to provide guidance on the issue this week.
Dr Cillian de Gascun, director of the NVRL said it is difficult at this stage to know the implication of this novel variant but it is concerning that laboratory studies have shown it to be more resistant to neutralising antibodies.
“We know that a lot of the vaccines that are currently in development are targeting a similar region of the genome and are designed in essence to induce a neutralising antibody response. So, it’s very early and far too early to be overly concerned, but I think at a worst case scenario you’re potentially starting a vaccination program with a mutant that is potentially resistant to the antibodies that the vaccines are going to elicit,” he said.

Health officials say vaccine news is positive but it's still 'too early to celebrate'
“That’s the worst case scenario, so I think it’s really important what the Danish authorities have done, I think they’ve acted really quickly. We certainly want to control the spread of this novel variant.
“The thing is, in order for it to have a significant impact on any vaccination program it would need to become the dominant strain globally and that’s probably unlikely. This is a mink-adapted virus so as it transmits back into humans, we would expect to see it adapt and change again. But thankfully at the moment it doesn’t seem to be any more transmissible in humans or any more virulent or severe in humans.”
He said there is no evidence of this mutation in humans in Ireland and the Department of Agriculture will be providing sequences for mink which can be studied at the laboratory.
As the worlds largest producer of mink fur, Denmark has 1,080 mink farms, with Covid-19 being detected on 207 of them.
According to the World Health Organisation, on 5 November, health authorities in Denmark reported 12 cases of Covid-19 that were caused by a mink-associated strain of the novel coronavirus.

Today Pfizer and BioNTech said their vaccine was 90% effective in preventing Covid-19 infections in ongoing Phase 3 trials.
According to preliminary findings, protection in patients was achieved seven days after the second of two doses, and 28 days after the first. The companies said they expect to supply up to 50 million vaccine doses globally in 2020, and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.
Speaking at the Department of Health press briefing this evening, Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan said he had seen the press release today, but pointed out that this Phase 3 trial “isn’t yet complete”.
“We’ve seen it and and we know there are a number of companies involved in vaccine development, and we’re hopeful that we will see reliable data when it becomes available to the regulatory authorities who have to inspect this data and when it’s published in the scientific literature and we’re in a position to to examine it, and determine,” he said.
“But we’ve seen it and we’re aware of it and, obviously, if these are borne out when we see the regularity data, if these are borne out when we see these scientific publications, that’s the kind of thing we’ll want to be seeing.”
Dr Cillian de Gascun, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory (NVRL) said the news is “positive”, but there will still be practical challenges to work out with any vaccine.
“Over 90% effective – if that holds true in the real world – will be a very good start from a vaccination perspective. Obviously, it’s a two dose schedule so there’s some potential logistical challenges around that,” he said.

HSE boss says 'we have to be honest' about what Christmas will look once Level 5 restrictions ease
“The duration of protection, obviously is something we don’t yet know. Similarly, we know from the media reports this vaccine requires an ultra cold chain of minus 80 degrees. So, again, logistically it could be difficult to roll it out so it’s not going to be the global solution, but certainly it’s very positive first step.”
Vaccine roll-out plans
Dr Holohan said the news is “hopeful but [it's] certainly not time for celebration”, and he wanted to remind people of the importance of sticking to the public health advice as it will take time to roll out any effective vaccination. He said there is work being done at the moment to pan for this roll out.
“There are a number of things about this particular vaccine and whatever vaccines will become available that are yet to be known in terms of the ultimate effectiveness in practice, the numbers of doses required, logistical issues around a cold chain and a range of things like that that all have to be factored into planning work that’s going on now with the HSE with the support of the department and other organisations.
“What will happen from a regulatory point of view is that regulation of vaccines is undertaken for EU member states as one single regulatory process at a European level by the European Medicines Agency and that’s how that’s assessed.

Source: Ryan Byrne/INPHO
In consecutive weekends, All-Ireland contenders Tyrone and Kerry have been dispatched from the competition. There are downsides to a straight knock-out championship, but nothing matches the excitement and drama it produces.
Kerry’s shock defeat blew open their side of the draw, meaning that one of Cork, Tipperary, Mayo or Galway will make the All-Ireland final.
Defenders from all four counties will arrive into training this week with a spring in their step, knowing that the path to 19 December is a little less hazardous now David Clifford and Sean O’Shea will be watching on from their sofas for the remainder of the year.
Connacht
Following their high-powered showing against the Rossies yesterday, Mayo have been provided with a golden opportunity to reach their first final since 2017. But potential landmines lie ahead and they won’t be taking Galway for granted in the Connacht final.
Padraic Joyce’s side are at a major disadvantage because they were handed a walkover by Sligo and are the only side in the country that haven’t kicked a ball in the championship yet.
There will be a temptation to overanalyse the 15-point hammering Mayo gave Galway in the league back in October, but it truth it will count for little. The Tribesmen will be closer to full strength and this time around they’ll likely swarm the middle third and bring a ferocious intensity that was lacking in Tuam Stadium. 
It’s been five years since Mayo have even made a provincial final, a remarkable statistic given they lifted the five titles before that. In previous years they’ve enjoyed entertaining qualifier runs after early exits in Connacht.
Perhaps the absence of a backdoor was what the Westerners needed to fully focus on provincial campaign with a do-or-die attitude. 
Munster
Conor Sweeney points a stunning free for Tipperary.

Cork are into the Munster final yet Tipperary offer a far different challenge to the Kingdom. Ronan McCarthy’s team will arrive in as warm favourites and deservedly so after beating the second-ranked team in the country.
But Tipperary will hold no fear of Cork. They beat the Rebels in the 2016 Munster semi-final and competed in the same division of the league this year. Cork required a second-half comeback – and three goals in total – to beat the Premier back in their Division 3 meeting in February.
As a player, it’s easy to get yourself up for a game when you arrive in written off like Cork were at the weekend. The real test of a team is whether they can bring the same hunger and tenacity when they go into a provincial final wearing the favourites tag.
Since last night, Cork players would have received plenty of congratulatory texts, (virtual) backslaps and read nice things about themselves online and in newspapers. After years of underachievement, it’s a welcome change for the senior members of the squad. But they must not allow it seep in and weaken their minds.
Of course, it’s important to enjoy the victories along the way. But Cork can’t bask in the warm afterglow of yesterday for long. Beating Kerry will do little good if they fall at the next hurdle. With Conor Sweeney and Michael Quinlivan in attack, Tipperary present a very real threat. 
The Premier haven’t reached the heights many expected since their run to the last four of the All-Ireland series in 2016. Kerry’s early exit has provided them a golden opportunity: beat Cork and they’re 70 minutes away from an All-Ireland final.
Tipperary come into the final in a great position, having turned around a six-point first-half deficit to defeat an in-form Limerick. They’ll have been buoyed by Kerry’s departure and David Power’s squad are now eyeing a set of Munster SFC medals, which is a rare commodity in Tipperary.

Dublin's Con O'Callaghan after the win over Westmeath on Saturday night.

Four sides remain in Leinster, where Dublin’s 10th title in-a-row looks inevitable. Dessie Farrell’s side were slick in Saturday’s quarter-final 11-point win over Westmeath which sealed a last four showdown against Laois.
Kerry might be out of the championship but two of their native sons remain alive to the east. Mike Quirke bemoaned Laois’s inconsistency in their win against Longford. Trailed by six at one stage but managed to seal a return to Croke Park, where Ross Munnelly will appear 18 seasons after making his debut under Mick O’Dwyer. 
On the other side of the draw, Meath versus Kildare promises to be an interesting affair. Andy McEntee’s team are further along in their development than the Lilywhites, as Jack O’Connor blooded six newcomers against Offaly yesterday. 
Meath made a decent fist of things against Dublin recently in the league and putting up 7-14 in Aughrim displayed their improving firepower. 
Kildare conceded 0-16 to Offaly and looked quite open in defence at times. Shea Ryan is a good find in the full-back line, but O’Connor may yet decide to rush Eoin Doyle back from injury to shore up the spine of their defence. 
Darragh Kirwan and Jordan Morris, two debutants last weekend for Kildare and Meath respectively, posted 3-10 between them on their championship debuts and will be hoping to build on that form this weekend.

The big question in Ulster is whether Armagh can take a giant leap forward under Kieran McGeeney and dump out genuine All-Ireland contenders. The former centre-back is in his sixth campaign over the Orchard and they’re showing real signs of progress, having sealed a return to Division 1 football for 2021.
Donegal overcame an extremely tricky assignment in beating Tyrone and should now be ranked behind Dublin as the second best side in the land. Will Armagh’s tidy forwards be able to handle Donegal’s defensive structure and can they shut down the likes of Jamie Brennan and Michael Murphy at the far end?
The other semi-final is a tough one to call. Cavan have beaten Monaghan and Antrim, while Down saw off Fermanagh. Both sides have plenty of quality footballers in their ranks and being on the weaker side of the draw affords them a big opportunity to reach the Ulster final.

There are around 7,000 PSNI officers, and a further 2,400 staff members.
Last Monday, 2 November, the PSNI said it would provide an organisation-wide figure for the numbers of officers and staff who are self-isolating, alongside the weekly Covid-related statistics on fines and notices issued by officers.
This comes after eight PSNI officers in Antrim tested positive for Covid-19 and two stations were closed for deep cleaning. On Saturday, the PSNI’s police college, Garnerville, was closed for deep cleaning after four student officers tested positive for Covid-19.
Last week there were 652 officers or staff absent because of Covid-19, 570 of which are self-isolating. This week there are currently 561 officers or staff ‘Covid-19 absent’, 477 of which are self-isolating.
The PSNI said that from March, it had issued these fines to members of the public:
1,159 Community Resolution Notices
1,983 COV1: Penalty notices (issued to over 18s only)
500 COV2: (86 commercial, 414 private.) Prohibition notices issued to licensed premises or for restriction of gatherings in a private dwelling
48 COV3: Failure to isolate, which carries a £1,000 fine.

NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS HAVE been made about a veteran Armagh politician’s comment referring to the US Vice President-elect Kamala Harris as “the Indian”.
John Taylor, who is also known as Lord Kilclooney, is the former deputy leader of the Ulster Unionist Party; he was in the role at the time that the Good Friday Agreement was being negotiated and struck.
He is now a member of the House of Lords, and has been accused of making racist comments on several occasions – including in 2018 against then-Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who he referred to as a “typical Indian”. He later deleted the tweet, and repeatedly denied the comments were racist.
Taylor tweeted the following out (before deleting it later):
What happens if Biden moves on and the Indian becomes President. Who then becomes Vice President?
UUP leader Steve Aiken has released a statement today calling Taylor’s comments “reprehensible”:
There is simply no excuse for it. He should delete what he has said and apologise. This isn’t the first time he has done something like this, but it should be the last.
Conservative MP Simon Hoare, who is chair of the Commons Northern Ireland affairs select committee, wrote that Taylor’s comment was “Bad. Rude. Racist. Appalling” and said he had submitted a formal complaint to the Lord Speaker’s office.
Another Tory MP Robert Halfon said that the comment was “appalling”. Labour shadow minister Wes Streeting said “action must be taken” over the peer’s tweet.
The Speaker of the House of Lords Norman Fowler has said that Taylor should “retract and apologise”.

This is an offensive way to refer to anyone, let alone a woman who has just made history. The comment is entirely unacceptable and has no place in British politics. I could not be clearer.
Taylor later deleted the tweet, saying it had been “cancelled”, and then accused the Lords speaker of being “misinformed”.
Earlier, when Taylor was asked on Twitter by other users why the term “the Indian” was used at all, and why Kamala Harris’ name wasn’t used, he replied:

“Afraid I did NOT know her name. She is totally new to me. Now I know it is Harris. Biden is proud to be Irish and Harris to be Indian. Both have every right to do so. I deplore some media describing her as being black. Colour racism should not be introduced.”
When asked if being Indian was something to be ashamed of, he replied:
“Nothing to be ashamed about. Indians are amongst the most reliable people. I have two as tenants so I have the experience.”
Taylor previously referred to Tánaiste Leo Varadkar as a “typical Indian” and accused him of “poor manners” after a visit to Northern Ireland; when asked to explain what he meant, he replied that it was “typical of this particular half Indian”. He later deleted the tweet, and repeatedly denied being a racist.

This week’s spend – up from €95.5 million last week – brings the spending on PUP to date to €4 billion. 
The number of recipients on the scheme has increased by 12,500 in the past week and Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys said that “the increase was anticipated and reflects the impact of moving to Level 5 restrictions”. 
The sector with the highest number of people receiving a PUP this week is accommodation and food service activities with 100,994 recipients.
This is followed by wholesale and retail trade (55,516 recipients) and other sectors such as hairdressers and beauty salons (30,141). 
When the government introduced Level 5 restrictions, which included the closure of pubs, restaurants and non-essential retail outlets, it reinstated the highest rate of the PUP.

This meant that those with gross weekly earnings of €400 or more receive a rate of €350 a week. 
Minister Humphreys said she was aware that people were “making huge sacrifices” as they continue to heed the public health advice.
She added: “But the fall in the number of Covid-19 cases in recent days is encouraging and gives cause for optimism ahead of the upcoming Christmas period. Let’s all keep going together. We brought this virus under control before. It is within our gift to do so again.”
In a statement this evening, the department also said that regulations are currently being finalised that will extend the 2020 earnings reference period for employees to September 2020.

It was reported that Esper had prepared a resignation letter last week, before last Tuesday’s election which saw Joe Biden defeat Trump.
CNN reported that Esper was expecting to resign regardless of the election outcome, claiming that his relationship with Trump had significantly deteriorated.
In a tweet this evening, Trump said that Esper had been “terminated” although he thanked him for his service.
The US president also said that Christopher C. Miller has been appointed as acting defence secretary in Esper’s place.
NBC first reported last week that Esper had prepared a letter of resignation, citing three officials.
The network pointed out that it was not uncommon for secretaries to prepare letters of resignation ahead of a presidential transition, but added that Esper’s letter was drafted as he was expected to be fired after the election even in the event of a Trump victory.
The former defence secretary reportedly helped members of Congress to draft legislation that would remove the names of Confederate leaders from military bases in the US – an issue that came to light again during this year’s Black Lives Matter protests.

Over the summer, Esper also courted controversy when he told reporters that he had no knowledge of plans to clear an area outside the White House of Black Lives Matter protesters.
His comments came after federal police opened tear gas and fired rubber bullets to break up a non-violent protest, clearing a path for Trump to stage a photo-op at a historic church, which drew criticism from demonstrators.","It was reported that Esper had prepared a resignation letter last week.",11,0,0,107638,"Nov 9th 2020, 6:30 PM"

Although Biden has been projected to win the election by US media outlets (as is traditional with each presidential election) votes are still being counted and the results are yet to be certified.
Media outlets’ projections are made by teams of experts and Biden is being named as the winner due to the statistical improbability of President Trump being able to make up the difference based on the number of votes left to count in the key swing states. 
However several lawsuits have already been filed by the Trump campaign team in recent days. 
Let’s take a look at how things are likely to play out between now and 20 January when Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are set to enter the White House. 
Where are we now? 
An estimated 159 million Americans cast their votes for a new president either before or on 3 November. 
People also voted for new elected members of the House of Representative, the Senate and in individual states there were a host of other votes on issues like reintroducing wolves and legalising recreational marijuana.  
It took until Saturday before the Associated Press and other outlets made their official calls on a winner, even though the outcome in most states was clear by Wednesday or Thursday.
Heading into the weekend the tide had well and truly turned in Biden’s favour as he pulled ahead in Georgia and Pennsylvania.

Pennsylvania turned out to be the deciding state in calling the election, with outlets like CNN and the Associated Press making the call for a Biden victory after the state was called at around 5pm on Saturday. 
That put him over the magic number of 270 Electoral College votes – and if he goes on to win in other key states where counting is continuing, like Arizona and Georgia, he could rack up 306 votes by the time the process concludes. 
So if Biden’s win is a projection, when will it be official?
As a reminder, the winner of the US presidency is not decided by the popular vote, but through the Electoral College. 
There are 538 members of the Electoral College, divided up between the US states with the number from each state based on its population size.
A state has one elector for each of its members of the House of Representatives, and one for each of the state’s two senators.
California – the most populous state -has 55 electors, Texas has 38, and New York and Florida have 29 each.
At the other end of the spectrum, lightly populated Alaska, Delaware, Vermont and Wyoming have only three electors each.
Each elector is a real person and they are picked in a two-part process – first by political parties in each state and second by voters during the general election. 
When voters cast their ballot for a presidential candidate, they are voting to select their state’s electors. 
The potential electors’ name in some states appears on the ballot below the name of the presidential candidate.
Biden’s win will be made official after the electors in each state cast their votes for the new president. 
Electors are due to vote on 14 December and Biden is set to be inaugurated on 20 January 2021.

These votes must be received by the president of the Senate and the head of the National Archives and Records Administration in the US no more than nine days later. 
On 6 January congress is due to meet to count the votes. The result is announced by the President of the Senate, currently Vice President Mike Pence. 
Once the minimum of 270 votes are achieved, the president-elect and the vice president-elect will be set to take the oath of office and begin their roles on 20 January.
What if Trump refuses to concede?
Conceding isn’t a legal requirement and is entirely optional, but has been the norm for losing candidates in the US since the late 1800s. 
Daniel Geary, an associate professor of US history at Trinity College Dublin, said there has never been a time when a candidate impeded the inauguration of a new president by refusing to concede. 
“This is really the only case where a president has clearly lost the election and refused to concede,” Geary told TheJournal.ie.  
There were the two disputed elections in 1876 and then the 2000 election, but we never had a candidate refuse to concede.

Prior to the election, Trump never said he would concede and in September, he refused to guarantee that he would transfer power if he lost the election. 
When asked at a White House press conference whether he was committed to the peaceful handover of power, he said: “Well, we’re going to have to see what happens.” 
Trump also seemed to suggest annulling mail-in ballots, noting that in such a scenario, he would remain in power.

What exactly does US President-elect Joe Biden plan to do?
“Get rid of the ballots and you’ll have a very peaceful – there won’t be a transfer, frankly. There’ll be a continuation.” 
Geary said: “It’s hard to see Trump making any concession and saying ‘I lost the election’… The narrative that Trump won doesn’t seem like it will go away, unfortunately.”  
The only thing that’s anywhere close [to the current situation] is 2000, but I think this is different because in that case, Al Gore was willing to concede when things had gone against him.
The 2000 election between Al Gore and George W Bush was contested in the Supreme Court, after a dramatic recount process in Florida, but Gore conceded in the end. 
In 1876, the election between Democrat Samuel Tilden and Republican Rutherford Hayes resulted in congress passing a law to decide the results of the disputed vote.
What are the legal challenges Trump has put forward?

The Trump campaign has mounted legal challenges to the results in several states, but no evidence has emerged of any widespread irregularities that would affect the results.
Trump plans to file another string of lawsuits in the coming week, according to his lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who said he had “a lot of evidence” of fraud.
Giuliani told the Fox News yesterday that Trump’s team would file a lawsuit in Pennsylvania today against officials “for violating civil rights, for conducting an unfair election [and] for violating the law of the state”.
“The first lawsuit will be Pennsylvania. The second will either be Michigan or Georgia. And over the course of the week, we should get it all pulled together,” Giuliani said.
Last week, the Trump campaign team filed lawsuits in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia and Nevada as Biden moved closer to the presidency. 
His team demanded better access for campaign observers at count centres and also made unsubstantiated claims about absentee ballots.
The 2000 election battle between Bush and Gore was brought to the Supreme Court. The result hinged on the outcome in Florida where Bush led with just over 500 votes.
In this instance, Trump has a much larger deficit of votes in states like Pennsylvania where he is down by nearly 50,000 votes. He is also down in multiple other states by a significant amount.

The Supreme Court has been cautious about its involvement in voting matters decided by states, and is aware that it risked its standing as an independent body in the wake of the 2000 ruling on Florida. 
A case this time around would put the political leanings of the court’s six conservative and three liberal justices in the spotlight – especially on Amy Coney Barrett, who joined the court only last month.
Trump said he rushed her appointment in part so she could be in place to hear any election cases.

What about recounts? 
Recounts can be requested or, in some cases, are automatically triggered if the margins are small between the two leading candidates. 
Georgia announced on Friday it would recount election votes as results showed Biden leading by just over 1,500 votes in the state. 
On 5 January, Georgia will also see two runoff races to settle which party – Democrat or Republican – will control the Senate. 
Recounts have played a role in changing the outcome for local elections in the US. 
“At local levels yes, but votes have to be very close to be overturned,” Daniel Geary said.
Trump has almost no chance of overturning this election. Even if he were to succeed in one state, it wouldn’t be enough.

What’s all this about ‘faithless electors’? 
At the end of the day, overwhelmingly, electors vote in line with the popular vote in their state and the projected presidential winner is inaugurated in January. 
However, nothing in the US Constitution obliges electors to vote in one way or another.
If some states require them to respect the popular vote and they do not, such so-called ‘faithless electors’ are subjected to a simple fine.
In July 2020, the US Supreme Court ruled that states could impose punishments on such disloyal voters by establishing laws mandating electors to cast their votes according to the popular vote in that state.
Between 1796 and 2016, around 180 electors cast votes contrary to the presidential or vice presidential candidate who won their state. But faithless electors have never determined a US election outcome. 
A few electors voted or attempted to vote for a different candidate in 2016, but it is extremely rare for an elector to defy the will of voters in the state. 
The issue of faithless electors has not been impactful “in a very long time”, Geary said. 
Technically electors can vote for whoever they want, but in practice they’re chosen by the parties to be loyal and there were a few that broke from Trump because they felt he was unfit, but that’s not going to happen this time.
All in all, there’s a lot of ‘process’ due to happen between now and 20 January when, all going to plan, Biden will become the 46th president of the United States.

US PRESIDENT-ELECT Joe Biden has announced a coronavirus task force as he begins preparations to enter the White House. 
Biden promised to be lead by the transition team of 13 experts as the US continues to see a spike in Covid-19 cases.
Speaking today, Biden urged Americans to wear masks, stressing it is “not a political statement” but the most important step they can take to prevent spread of the coronavirus.
“I implore you, wear a mask…. A mask is not a political statement but it is a good way to start pulling the country together,” Biden said in Wilmington after holding a virtual briefing with his Covid-19 advisory council.
Biden, who himself has routinely worn face coverings while campaigning and out in public, said that even as good news of a successful coronavirus vaccine trial has emerged, “the single most effective thing we can do to stop the spread of Covid is to wear a mask.”
The US has had more than 9.8 million cases and more than 237,000 deaths from the virus since the pandemic started, according to Johns Hopkins data.
The country reported more than 126,000 positive cases and more than 1,000 deaths from Covid-19 on Saturday, according to the university. It marked the fourth day in a row that new cases topped more than 100,000, as the country continued to break its own record for daily cases on nearly every day last week.
On the campaign trail, Biden promised to “take the muzzle off our experts” and put a national strategy in place to “get ahead” of the virus and end the pandemic crisis. 
The Covid-19 advisory board announced today will help guide the Biden-Harris Transition team in planning for the President-elect’s robust federal response.
He previously touted a nationwide mask mandate and a plan that allows for free and widespread Covid-19 testing, boosting of US medical equipment manufacturing and making any future vaccine “free to everyone, whether or not you’re insured”. 
“Dealing with the coronavirus pandemic is one of the most important battles our administration will face, and I will be informed by science and by experts,” Biden in a statement today. 
“The advisory board will help shape my approach to managing the surge in reported infections; ensuring vaccines are safe, effective, and distributed efficiently, equitably, and free; and protecting at-risk populations.”
The president-elect is expected to make his first public remarks since his victory speech on Saturday night later on this evening. 
The announcement of his new group came as US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech announced that a jointly developed vaccine had so far proven 90 percent effective in preventing infections in trials.
Biden welcomed this, while cautioning it would be “many more months” before mass vaccination was possible and urging Americans to wear masks – something he says he wants to mandate nationally once in office.
Source: Carolyn Kaster
He previously appointed a former surgeon general, Dr Vivek Murthy, and a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner, David Kessler, as co-chairs of his coronavirus working group. 
Additional members of the advisory board announced today have served in previous administrations and have experience “engaging with and leading our country’s response to nationwide and worldwide public health crises”.
Of note is Rick Bright who was ousted from the Trump administration due to political pressure, after he expressed opposition to the Trump administration’s promotion of unproven drug therapies to fight Covid-19

The action, which the High Court was told is a test action, has been brought against the Garda Commissioner and the State by John Flannery a farmer of Mill Road, Newtown, Nenagh Co Tipperary.
Justice Charles Meenan heard that Flannery is the holder of firearms licence has been a member of the National Association of Regional Game Council, which represents game clubs, for over 30 years.
During the currency of the Level 5 restrictions introduced by the Government last month to help prevent the spread of the Covid-19 virus Flannery had continued to shoot authorised species on lands owned by him and his family, for the purpose of taking exercise.
That practise, the court heard, is commonly known as ‘rough shooting’. He claims that he has done his shooting within 5km from his family home.
In late October Flannery said he learned that gardaí deemed that anyone shooting pheasant, when that season opened at the start of November, during the currency of the Level 5 restrictions was prohibited.
He said that the gardaí published details on its website regarding the pheasant shooting season which it said “normally involves shooting club members travelling to pheasant shoots around the country. frequently in groups.”
The statement added that this was regarded as sports shooting and was therefore prohibited while the Level 5 restrictions are in place.
Flannery said the National Association sought clarification from the gardaí that individuals carrying out ‘rough shooting’ in compliance with the Level 5 restrictions was not prohibited.
However, no clarification was published. Flannery believes that the information on the garda website contains a misleading and false statement regarding the true legal position.
He fears that persons engaged in rough shooting could end up facing a criminal prosecution, which he claims is unlawful.
Test case 
The action came before Justice Charles Meenan, who following an application by Mark de Blacam SC for Flannery directed that the application for permission to bring the action to be brought on notice to the respondents on 8 December next.
The judge, who was told the matter was of great concern to Flannery and other game club members, said he was not prepared to bring the matter to court any earlier.
This was because the Level 5 restrictions may be lifted or relaxed by 1 December next.
There was no point in allocating judicial resources to hear what may well be a very interesting legal issue that may become moot or pointless in three weeks’ time, the judge added.

The judge also noted that while the current shooting season for pheasant and woodcock had commenced on November, it will run until the end of January.
Counsel said that this was an important test case as his client and other hunting enthusiasts were concerned that the issue may arise again, and that there may be a return to Level 5 restrictions in the future.
His judicial review proceedings are against the Garda Commissioner, the Minister for Justice, Ireland and the Attorney General
Flannery seeks a declaration that he is not in breach of the temporary regulations, instructed under the 1947 Health Act to help combat the pandemic, by shooting game in the open countryside within the 5km limit during the current of the level 5 restrictions.
He also seeks injunctions preventing the gardaí from prosecuting him under the 1947 Health Act arising out of an allegation that he engaged in shooting game during the currency of the Level 5 restrictions.
He further wants the court to direct An Garda Siochana to publish a statement on its website that “rough shooting carried out on an individual basis, in compliance with the current level 5 restrictions, is not prohibited by the temporary regulations.”","John Flannery fears that persons engaged in rough shooting could end up facing a criminal prosecution, which he claims is unlawful.",118,0,1,43215,"Nov 9th 2020, 5:35 PM"

Connolly and team-mate Adam Idah were forced to miss the fixture in Bratislava, as they were deemed close contacts to a member of the FAI backroom staff who tested positive for Covid-19.
It subsequently emerged that Idah and Connolly had sat in the wrong seats for the trip.
The back of the plane had been reserved for the non-playing members of staff, while management and players were allocated seats at the front. The players got on first, and four Irish stars, including Connolly and Idah, took the seats at the back of the plane and were not told to move to their previously designated spot. 
When it was put to him that Connolly should have stuck to the original seating plan, the Brighton star disagreed: “No, and it’s frustrating when people say that. I left my seat, but I didn’t know I was going to sit beside someone who had a positive test. I could have stayed in my seat and someone beside me could have had it and I would have got away with it, as I’d moved down the back.
To see stuff like that is frustrating, even on social media. I moved my seat, but how was I meant to know where someone who tested positive was sat? I don’t look back and think: ‘I wish I had sat there.’ It happened and I’ve moved on.”
After Ireland missed out on Euros progression following an agonising penalty shootout loss, to compound Connolly and Idah’s woe, the FAI staff member’s test proved to be a false positive, meaning they could have played in the fixture without any ill effects after all.
The Galway native admitted it was a frustrating experience having to watch the game from the sidelines.
“It was tough obviously. Like I’ve said, at 20 years of age, I might never get that chance for my country to play in such a big game to get to a tournament. It was obviously frustrating and to find out after that it was a false positive as well was a bit gutting, but that is last month and it’s all about these three games.”

Ahead of upcoming clashes with England, Wales and Bulgaria, Connolly also spoke about David McGoldrick’s retirement, suggesting he would love to play in his more natural central attacking role now that the Sheffield United man has departed the international scene, while reiterating that he would still be content to feature in a wider position if necessary.
With five caps to his name, Connolly used words like “frustrating” and “alright” to describe his international career thus far, while expressing optimism that there are better days to come, with a well-documented goal drought currently afflicting the Irish side.
Similar words could be applied to Connolly’s club career at present. The youngster burst onto the scene with a brace in his full Premier League debut against Spurs in October 2019, but he’s found the net just twice since then.
A lack of game time this season has similarly been a concern. Since the last international window, Connolly had made just two appearances — both off the bench in the dying minutes — for Brighton.
Of course, it is frustrating to not be playing — I think for any player, it is. But I’m just trying to work hard and keep the head down.
“I think everyone needs minutes to progress, no matter what age, whether 20 or 35.
 “Hopefully, I can get some game time this week and get some minutes under my belt, and if I do get the chance to play when I go back to Brighton, then of course I’ll be ready.”

Dylan Hayes (25) with a last address at The Crescent, Kilteragh in Dooradoyle and Gerard Hogan (37) with a last address at Raheen Square in Ballinacurra Weston were both found guilty of the murder of Shane Murphy on 30 April, 2015.
The deceased, of The Grove, Pallasgreen in Co Limerick, died from a stab wound to the heart, and also suffered multiple penetrating injuries to the trunk and upper arms.
In May 2017, trial judge Mr Justice Patrick McCarthy imposed the mandatory life sentence on both men.
Evidence was given during the case that Hayes had confronted the deceased at a house party in Pallasgreen, asking him: “Did you call me a junkie?”.
Hayes believed that the deceased had been talking about him, saying that he was doing heroin at the house in Pallasgreen earlier the same week.
Hayes told gardaí that the deceased responded: “Yeah, I did. What are you going to do about it?”
It was at this point, according to Hayes’ statements to gardaí, that he went to the kitchen, grabbed a knife and came back to the sitting room where he began stabbing the deceased repeatedly in the chest, stomach, arms and legs.
Deputy State Pathologist Dr Linda Mulligan said one of the stab wounds pierced the heart of the deceased, while others had damaged both lungs and the liver.
Defence wounds to his hands suggested that he had tried to protect himself as Hayes wielded the knife.
The case in relation to Hogan was that he was involved in a joint enterprise with Hayes to murder the deceased.
One witness at the house said she saw Hogan attack and stab the deceased with Hayes. She also said that Hogan and Hayes were saying “get him, get him” as they “egged” each other on.
Joint intention to kill
Delivering his charge, the judge told a jury that they could find the accused men guilty of murder if the prosecution had proven beyond reasonable doubt that they had formed a joint intention to kill or cause serious injury to the deceased.
Hayes’ barrister Mark Nicholas argued before the appellate court last May that the judge’s charge on provocation was deficient as the jury was not properly instructed.
The senior counsel said there was no explanation by the judge to the jurors of the requirement to assess the accused’s actions subjectively as well as in a clear and usable form.
Hogan’s lawyer, Michael Bowman, appealed his client’s conviction on a number of grounds. The barrister argued that the prosecution had relied upon both words spoken and acts carried out by Hogan including attacking the deceased with a screwdriver.
It was open to the jury to conclude that Hogan did not stab the deceased as the pathologist testified that the injuries to deceased were caused by a knife and not a screwdriver, he said.
He also argued that if the jury so concluded, then they needed to be directed specifically as to whether they could rely on words which were attributed to Hogan as encouragement to the co-accused, and also whether the words amounted to a communication of an intent to kill or cause serious harm.
Furthermore, Bowman also submitted that the trial judge had also refused a defence requisition to charge the jury in relation to the ability of a party to withdraw from a common design or joint enterprise.
Issue of provocation
In a judgement returned electronically today, President of the Court of Appeal Mr Justice George Birmingham, who sat with Ms Justice Isobel Kennedy and Ms Justice Una Ní Raifeartaigh, said nothing that the trial judge said in relation to the issue of provocation could be seen as putting the jury wrong and his treatment of the issue was adequate.
The judge said that when the trial judge’s charge was viewed as a whole, it did not appear objectionable.
“It repeatedly emphasised that all matters required to be proved had to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, obviously this included that the words were spoken by Gerard Hogan with the intention of “egging on” the co-accused and so this ground of appeal fails,” he explained.
#OPEN JOURNALISM No news is bad news Support The Journal Your contributions will help us continue to deliver the stories that are important to you
SUPPORT US NOW
The judge said that the three-judge Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge that there was insufficient, if any, evidence in the case suggesting a withdrawal from a joint enterprise which would have required or justified a charge directed to this issue.
The Court was satisfied that the ground of appeal must fail, he added.
In summary, the judge highlighted that the three-judge panel had not been persuaded to uphold any ground of appeal advanced by either appellant and would accordingly dismiss the appeal.
Last May, Counsel for the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Orla Crowe, argued in her submissions that four persons present in the house had witnessed the murder and each of them had implicated both appellants in the attack on the deceased.
One of these witnesses had given very clear evidence to the trial of a physical and verbal engagement by both defendants on the deceased, she said, and pointed out that this went to the common design element of the offence.
She added that “science” had not removed Hogan from the physical attack on the deceased.
Regarding the charge of provocation, the barrister said the trial judge had given a very clear outline to the jury of the defence of provocation and made it entirely clear that the test was subjective.
The jurors could not have been under any misconception in relation to the law, she submitted.
Crowe explained that counsel for Hogan had suggested that his client had either not fully participated in the attack or withdrawn from it but she said this had not been borne out by the witnesses who heard and saw what was happening in the room at the time.
She emphasised that this was a “classic case” of joint enterprise and common design and there was no evidence in the case that Hogan had withdrawn from the joint enterprise.","The two were found guilty of the murder of Shane Murphy on 30 April, 2015.",0,0,0,22546,"Nov 9th 2020, 4:02 PM"

A VACCINE JOINTLY developed by Pfizer and BioNTech was 90% effective in preventing Covid-19 infections in ongoing Phase 3 trials, the companies has announced today, exceeding the expectations of experts.
The statement was released as soaring coronavirus cases across the world have forced many millions of people back into lockdown, causing further damage to ravaged economies.
European stock markets and oil prices jumped on the announcement.
And US President Donald Trump, who lost last week’s election in part over his administration’s response to the pandemic, hailed the announcement as “such great news”. President-elect Joe Biden, meanwhile, said the news gives “hope” but a long battle lies ahead.
According to preliminary findings, protection in patients was achieved seven days after the second of two doses, and 28 days after the first.
The companies said they expect to supply up to 50 million vaccine doses globally in 2020, and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.
“The first set of results from our Phase 3 Covid-19 vaccine trial provides the initial evidence of our vaccine’s ability to prevent Covid-19,” Pfizer chairman and CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement.
“We are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a much-needed breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis,” he said.
“We are reaching this critical milestone in our vaccine development program at a time when the world needs it most.”
Seeking emergency use authorisation
Across much of the globe, Covid-19 infections rates are hitting record highs, with hospital intensive care units filling up and death tolls mounting.
US biotech firm Moderna, several state-run Chinese labs, and a European project led by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca are also thought to be closing in on potentially viable vaccines.
Two Russian Covid-19 vaccines have been registered for use even before clinical trials were completed, but have not been widely accepted outside of Russia.
The Phase 3 clinical trial — the final stage — of the new vaccine, BNT162b2, began in late July and has enrolled 43,538 participants to date, 90% of whom have received a second dose of the vaccine candidate as of 8 November.
Pfizer said it is gathering two months of safety data following the final dose — a requirement of the US Food and Drug Administration — to qualify for Emergency Use Authorization, which it expects by the third week in November.
“We look forward to sharing additional efficacy and safety data generated from thousands of participants in the coming weeks,” Bourla said.
‘Watershed moment’
While the Pfizer-BioNTech trial has yet to be peer-reviewed by experts, scientists reacted positively – if cautiously to the results.
Michael Head, Senior Research Fellow in Global Health, University of Southampton, called it an “excellent result for a first generation vaccine”.
Peter Horby, Professor of Emerging Infectious Diseases and Global Health in the Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, said Pfizer’s announcement “feels to me like a watershed moment” in the pandemic.
But others pointed out that there would likely be significant logistical problems in getting the vaccine to everyone, especially given it must be kept super-cooled and currently requires two doses to bestow immunity.
Eleanor Riley, professor of Immunology and Infectious Disease at the University of Edinburgh, said for example that the results did not disclose the ages of participants.
“If a vaccine is to reduce severe disease and death, and thus enable the population at large to return to their normal day-to-day lives, it will need to be effective in older and elderly members of our society,” she said.
Dozens more candidates
The so-called messenger RNA, or mRNA, vaccine is a new approach to protecting against viral infection.
Unlike traditional vaccines, which work by training the body to recognise and kill proteins produced by pathogens, mRNA tricks the patient’s immune system to produce viral proteins itself.
The proteins are harmless, but sufficient to provoke a robust immune response.
The study also will evaluate the potential for the vaccine candidate to provide protection against Covid-19 in those who have had prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2, as well as vaccine prevention against severe Covid-19 disease.
Pfizer and BioNTech plan to submit data from the full Phase 3 trial for scientific peer-review publication.
As of mid-October, the World Health Organization (WHO) has identified 42 “candidate vaccines” at the stage of clinical trials, up from 11 in mid-June.

Ten of them were at the most advanced phase 3 stage, in which a vaccine’s effectiveness is tested on a large scale, generally tens of thousands of people across several continents.

No normality yet 
The World Health Organisation’s special envoy on Covid-19, David Nabarro, said “any promising news about a vaccine is great news”, but cautioned that there is still some way to go.
He told the BBC: “Everybody who’s hearing and watching this will be saying ‘wow, does this mean that life can go back to normal in the near future?’
“Life will go back to a new normal, and we’re not there yet.
“We do need to be following through on all the basic rules that we now know are important for dealing with this virus – our own behaviour, the way in which governments run their health systems, and also unity between nations.
“And I just want to stress that these principles that we’ve been working for over the last 10 months are still absolutely essential.
“Even if a vaccine arrives in the near future we’ve got many months of still dealing with the virus as a constant threat that we’ve got to make certain that we continue to do all that is necessary to solve the virus causing major problems.
“The vaccine will help, but it’s not going to be a complete game changer.”
US President-elect Joe Biden was equally as cautious and warned that the end of the battle against Covid-19 is still months away.
“This news follows a previously announced timeline by industry officials that forecast vaccine approval by late November. Even if that is achieved, and some Americans are vaccinated later this year, it will be many more months before there is widespread vaccination in this country,” Biden said in a statement.
Experts have said the full effect of a vaccine on transmission in the population will not be known until one is in circulation and more data is collected.

The abuser, described as “evil and disgusting” by one of his victims, was jailed for 20 years in 2017 for a series of offences over a 17-year period.
His victims told the court that their abuser had groomed, threatened and humiliated them, carrying out sometimes weekly assaults in outhouses, sheds and fields on the family farm.
The man, who can’t be named to protect the identities of his victims, only stopped the abuse when the eldest victim, by then an adult, threatened to expose him.
Judges at the Court of Appeal today dismissed his appeal in an ex tempore judgment following a brief hearing.
Barrister for the appellant, Roderick O’Hanlon SC, argued that the sentencing judge should have imposed a partially suspended sentence to give his client an incentive to rehabilitate.
He also said that the judge did not give sufficient regard to his client’s good record and the fact he had not offended in the 18 years following the last offence.
The court has heard that the man went on to have a family of his own and was a respected member of his community and a participant in a local church and GAA activities, O’Hanlon said.
Desmond Dockery SC for the Director of Public Prosecutions said that a good record can only be considered in cases where the offending behaviour is seen as a “lapse from grace”.
This case, he said, involved “heinous” abuse over many years against multiple victims. He said: “It could not be said that he comes before the court as a person of good character.”
Delivering today’s judgment Justice John Edwards said this case was at the utmost level of seriousness and noted that the sentencing judge had considered imposing a life sentence. He opted instead for a 20-year sentence with five years of post-release supervision having taken into consideration the man’s decision to plead guilty and other “modest” mitigating factors.
Justice Edwards said the Court accepts that rehabilitation is an important aim of sentencing but there are cases where other aims take priority.
In this case, he said, there was no evidence of remorse or an “earnest effort to reform or rehabilitate”. He said there was “no reality” to a suspended sentence as there was no basis to suggest he had gained any insight into his offending, addressed any of his underlying problems or shown any remorse.
He also dismissed an argument that the trial judge had not adequately considered that the abuser began offending when he was 15 and was, therefore, a minor. He pointed out that he was an adult when he began abusing four of the seven victims.
Justice Edwards, sitting with the President of the Court of Appeal Justice George Birmingham and Justice Isobel Kennedy, dismissed all grounds of appeal.
Evidence in trial
The now 53-year-old was aged 15 when he got a job as a farm labourer and began abusing his first victim. The sisters and brothers were aged as young as seven and ten when the abuse began. The attacks continued for 17 years, taking place in farm sheds, outhouses and fields.
He was charged with 187 counts of indecent assault and sexual assault of the seven children between 1982 and 1999. He pleaded guilty in December 2016 to 52 sample charges including oral and anal rape and was sentenced in March 2017.

His first victim was just 10 years old when he began sexually assaulting him up to three times a week at various locations including within the family home.
In 1983, he also began orally raping the man’s 7-year-old sister. He continued to rape her for five years. At the same time, he was anally raping a third brother, who was aged between 10 and 12.
Six of the victims were subjected to sustained and regular assaults including rapes on a monthly and weekly basis. A seventh sibling was sexually assaulted twice from the age of seven.
The eldest child said his abuser was “a master manipulator” who split the children apart to control them and get what he wanted.
“I was overpowered by an evil and disgusting man who spent his life manipulating me,” he said. He later added that he felt that “it’s a miracle that we have all survived”.
Many of the victims described how sustained and regular abuse destroyed their childhood and has blighted their adulthood.
Some of the victims described struggling with alcohol abuse in their adult life and many said they still suffered from flashbacks, depression, anxiety and fear.
Trial judge Justice Patrick McCarthy said the man became the employee of the victims’ parents from a young age and a year later, he moved into the family home.
“He must have been treated as a family member, at least in terms of day to day matters,” the judge said, adding this made the crimes more obnoxious. He described them as being “a serious breach of trust”.","The man was jailed for 20 years in 2017 for a series of offences over a 17-year period.",3,0,0,34639,"Nov 9th 2020, 3:12 PM"

The judge acceded to defence solicitor Matthew de Courcy’s request for the case to be listed for a video-link appearance at Cloverhill District Court on Wednesday morning.
The accused, who has not yet indicated how he will plead, looked ahead and sat motionless during the hearing. Dressed in a tan jacket and blue jeans, and wearing a plaster cast on his left arm, he did not address the court.
A legal aid application was successful.
Counsel said his client was a suitable candidate and the judge noted there was no objection from gardaí.

The solicitor asked the judge to recommend “appropriate medical care” in relation to the accused’s physical injury and his mental health.
He had a broken hand and had been seen by a doctor on Sunday, the court heard. The judge agreed to make the recommendation.
A bail application in a murder case must be made before the High Court. A book of evidence has yet to be completed before he can be returned for trial.

A long-standing stalwart in the current setup, Paul drove home last night and reckoned it was the first championship game of his career that his father had been unable to attend.
The beeping car horns outside Páirc Uí Chaoimh indicated the delight of locals after Mark Keane’s 2020 strike had replicated the knockout blow landed by Tadhg Murphy in 1983 into the same City End goal of the stadium.
Jimmy Kerrigan was in the vicinity when Murphy hit the net 37 years ago just as his son had a front-row view on a November night when a returning AFL player provided a sensational conclusion.
“I rang him on the way home,” said Paul.
“It was one of the first things he said to be honest. It was quite similar, he was in a fairly close position to where I was.
“It was funny, I was standing with Colm O’Callaghan after the match, I’d be friendly enough with him.
“One of the backroom team came over and said, ‘It’s like Tadhgie Murphy and your father in ’83.’
“I said, ‘Yeah it’s uncanny, unbelievable.’
“Colm goes to me, ‘What happened in ’83 anyway?’
“I’d to explain it there. Next thing he goes, ‘What did he mean there by your old man?’
“I said, ‘Oh he played for Cork as well.’
“He was like, ‘What, did your father play for Cork?!’
“I was like, ‘He did yeah, he was playing for about 14 years.’
“I got some kick out of it, it was so funny. That’s it, no hang ups, like I’d say Colm was born in ’99. He’s a great fella, he keeps me young.”
O’Callaghan was part of eight debutants that saw gametime over the course of a marathon affair that stretched on for over 90 minutes.
Their fearlessness and ambition were crucial ingredients in Cork breaking the stranglehold that Kerry have exerted on the province.
That outcome was only sealed in the most dramatic fashion with Kerrigan right there to witness a famous goal from the Collingwood-contracted player.
“I did think we’d work a free or a score. I was half thinking when we were keeping possession, ‘It could be penalties here you know’. 
“Luke hit it and I kind of looked and I saw Mark Keane was in the square by himself. I just tried to get in just in case it might break behind him but he caught it, I just landed towards his right foot just as he struck it.
“It hit the side of the net on the far side, it was an unbelievable finish. It was very well done, he used his body well. He’s a big man, that strength to nudge off his man. When we were passing around, you could hear the Kerry boys shouting, ‘It’s over, it’s over’, that the match was over. When it went into the net then, you knew it was done. It was unbelievable.”

Kerrigan got another reminder later of the emerging nature of Cork’s team.
“Mark Keane sent me a picture after, that five years ago I was presenting him a medal. He was a big boy back then even.
“He said, ‘Look what I found there.’
“It was funny enough. It was Cork U15s or something.
“He’ll take him a bit of time to get back into the skills, this week was his best week training. He just needs to get into the swing of things, look he’ll take huge confidence from that. He mightn’t even know the significance of what he’s done.”
The jolt of a last-minute goal leaves players dazed as they try to absorb the outcome. The flipside of yesterday for Kerrigan was the 2015 Munster club final, his Nemo side caught at the death when Michael Quinlivan intervened for Clonmel Commercials.
“I was only thinking about that this morning and it’s the worst ever. I know it’s only sport but it’s a thing that makes you shudder.
“And Kerry were sick. Jesus Christ like, that’s devastation when that happens. There’s no way back. I’ve been there and it’s a tough one.”

He can easily measure the value of this. His senior championship bow came when Cork won at the expense of Kerry in 2008. Further successes arrived against their arch-rivals in 2009 and 2012 but the addition of a fourth win to Kerrigan’s record has taken some time.
“There’s been some defeats have been horrific, you’d struggle to look in the mirror after.
“I was lucky there when we had good times. There was a good shot of guys who came in after that who have had a lot of tough times. I’d be looking at Kevin O’Driscoll, Mark (Collins), I know Mark came on in 2012, Luke, Hurley, Johnno, Ruairi, Maguire, then Loughrey and Tomas Clancy (out injured), Kevin Crowley is there a long time as well, missed out through injury.
“A lot of guys, the scar tissue was there, a lot of demons. I feel really happy for those guys to get a big win like that.”
The volume of well wishes he received last night in the aftermath of the game took him aback. He was conscious as well of the key members of their successful 2010 setup who have passed away, selector Terry O’Neill last November and team-mate Kieran O’Connor last July.
It was a hard week as well for the Nemo Rangers club with the death of stalwart Jim Cremin.
“It’s the first championship game for Cork since Kieran and Terry passed away. I was thinking of them this morning, and of Jim Cremin. It’s been a tough couple of months for lots of people in different ways.
“For Nemo lads and UCC lads especially, Jim would have been in my mind definitely this week. Kieran as well, we’ve our own Whats App group with the 2010 team. It’s one of our lads who isn’t in that any more.
“They’re two good Cork lads that are gone, maybe they’re smiling above looking at that yesterday.
“The amount of past players that have texted me, they’ve been through a lot playing with Cork so they were all having a drink at home last night and they were very, very happy which is great to see.”
The result generates a burst of joy in Cork football circles after a period of seemingly relentless struggle. This marked Cork’s first win over a Division 1 league ranked side since 2012 against Kerry.
The seeds of the revival were sown in 2019 in Kerrigan’s eyes.
“I think last year the corner was turned, the realisation of what’s required. The culture and the closeness of the group turned a bit and then the 20s coming in. It was quite similar to when we came in after we won our All-Ireland (U21 in ’07). The confidence there, you’re not really hung up about anything, you’re just going out and playing.
“I could just feel it when we met up yesterday, there was just real belief there. We were in there for the whole game, didn’t leave them get out of sight. You have to hang in there and your luck will come. That’s been an Achilles heel the last couple of years, it’s giving them a head start.
“The win was made on the training pitch since we came back from the lockdown. It’s been top class. Fellas deserve huge credit for how tuned in and sharp they’ve been. That’s what we’re looking forward to now, recovery tonight and back Tuesday.

“Maybe they felt the pressure a bit more than us yesterday. I honestly think we got a bit of a boost when we saw they were playing with a defender up top. We were suprised but said, ‘Yeah, that suits us fine’.
“You consider we finished without Ian, Killian, Hurley and Sean Powter on the pitch. A lot of extra-time was played without them. It’s a great testament. I thought Luke was unbelievable when he came on in terms of scoring. The one just before half-time of extra-time against the wind, it gave me some lift coming off at half-time.
“I thought he’d be playing, he wasn’t. He took it unbelievably well and just came on and made the difference. The conditions now in the winter, a good free-taker like that is hard to beat.” 
The typical summer setting for championship meant it was different for Kerrigan to head into Coláiste Chríost Rí where he teaches, on the morning after a game. It’s not a complaint though to have to work today after the interruptions caused to work, sport and life in 2020.
After such a lengthy wait for action in his 13th senior season, he’s enthused at the prospect of a Munster final. Recent seasons of dejecting exits mean this has been a year on the football field to cherish, as he points out his six-month-old son Billy has yet to experience a loss as a Cork senior football supporter.
But he stresses the stage of the competition and there have been frequent close-run affairs with final opponents Tipperary to breed caution now.

“There’s no cup won yet. That’s one monkey off the back for a lot of us now to get the big win against Kerry, now the next thing is to get a bit of silverware. A lot of fellas have nothing really won.
“There’s no doubt they’ll fancy Cork far more than Kerry. They’re in the same division than us and they’ll see it as a massive opportunity. It’s been really tight. We beat them well enough in Thurles one time and they beat us one year when I was captain up there.
“Like Jack Kennedy, Sweeney and Quinlivan would get into most teams in the country. They have their quality and they’ll nothing to lose. We just have to get our training right, do our homework like we did for Kerry and then go out to actually do it on the day.”

991,215,"TUI says 'traditional' Junior and Leaving Cert exams must return next year",https://www.thejournal.ie/teachers-union-leaving-cert-junior-cert-5261042-Nov2020/,"THE TEACHERS’ UNION of Ireland (TUI) has said that if schools are being kept open as a priority, it will “not countenance or accept” any attempt not to hold the written State exams next year.
The traditional Leaving Cert written exams were not held this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and instead, a system of Calculated Grades was introduced that would base students’ Leaving Cert results on an assessment by their teachers, followed by ‘standardisation’ by an algorithm commissioned by the Department of Education.
Although this resulted in more high grades than the average year, and allowed Leaving Cert students to progress to third-level or work this year, problems with the system were highlighted by students, parents and teachers.
Two errors were then found in the ‘standardisation’ algorithm, which affected over 6,000 Leaving Cert students and 7,200 grades; an independent review is being carried out. 
Although the Minister for Education Norma Foley has said that the intention now is that Leaving Cert 2021 ”will be the traditional Leaving Certificate as we would know it”, the TUI has said that more certainty is needed. 
“This must now be confirmed,” the TUI said today, calling the traditional approach to the “highly trusted” written Leaving Cert exam.
…With seven months to June 2021, there is ample time to ensure that the customary State Examinations – which enjoy significant and unmatched public trust – can run smoothly and safely.
The Union also said that the Department of Education “breached and betrayed the trust of teachers” by reneging on an assurance for the 2020 Calculated Grades system that the student ranking would only be available in response to a data access request.
These class rankings were given to students who wished to appeal their grades, and were made available through the student portal from 28 September, after the Department of Education received legal advice.

The union said that it was only done by teachers “to improve the accuracy of the data collected”, and the decision to release the data to students was “a hugely damaging move” and served “absolutely no useful practical or moral purpose”.
TUI general secretary Michael Gillespie said:
Students and teachers need certainty, and the Minister must provide this by confirming that the customary State examinations will take place in June 2021.
“Our experience of Calculated Grades leaves us in no doubt that the customary State Examinations are more reliable and enjoy greater trust among the public at large and, critically, among students and teachers.”
Gillespie added that some schools are “hedging their bets” by scheduling more formal assessments that can be used as an evidential base for the award of Calculated Grades, in case the traditional exams don’t go ahead.
“This is leading to a distortion of teaching and learning patterns and is placing an insupportable burden of additional work and unrelenting pressure on students and teachers,” he said.

Gardaí are continuing to appeal for information into the murder of Jo Jo and have asked that anyone who met or saw her the night she disappeared to come forward.

The list includes three Dublin sushi restaurants operating from the same bedroom of a house, which were ordered to close over a number of breaches:

Nagoya Sushi (takeaway), 1 Shanvarna Road, Santry, Dublin 9

FSAI inspectors found “no evidence” that Sushi using raw fish and rice was “being prepared in a safe manner”.
The inspector stated that there was no evidence that staff had been trained or supervised in food safety.
Dr Pamela Byrne, FSAI chief executive, expressed concern that the closure orders related to individuals running online unregistered and unsupervised restaurants.
“Running a food business that has not been registered and is therefore not supervised is totally unacceptable and poses a very serious risk to consumers’ health,” she said.
“In these instances, the unregistered businesses were producing sushi without any hygiene or temperature controls.  Sushi is a very high-risk product because it contains raw fish which must be kept chilled to reduce the growth of dangerous bacteria.
“It can also contain cooked rice, which is a ready-to-eat product that must be kept chilled. In these instances, the absence of a food safety management system, no monitoring of the cold chain and no evidence of traceability of raw ingredients posed a grave and immediate danger to consumer health.”

The government is facing criticism over the lack of clarity on what pandemic restrictions will apply at over the festive period, with Level 5 restrictions due to be lifted on 1 December. 
Reid told Newstalk Breakfast this morning that “the trends are good” for Ireland but people will still need to limit their social contacts in December.
“I think we have to learn from what happened earlier on in the year as the economy and society opened up in June and July. And then in August, September, October – particularly in October – we saw massive rises in the cases again,” he said.
So I think we have to learn from that period this time, in terms of how we organise our lives through December and onwards after that.
“How we continuously reduce our numbers of contacts that we have, how we protect our households, how we reduce the number of people we have in our household and the households we visit.
“Christmas is a very important time for families, it’s a very important time for Irish society, it’s hugely valued by everybody. And we do need to give people good hope and encouragement that the actions they’re taking now does merit us all having a reasonable Christmas.
“But I think we equally have to be honest with people and just say as well that if we manage to work through December and throughout Christmas by carrying on the behaviours that we’re doing at the moment, and it’s really about reducing our contacts, it’s a really big important factor that we don’t end up in the same position heading into January, February or March.”
He added that it was still too early to make predictions, “because there are another few weeks to go of the current restrictions, it’s too early to say what that will all look like”.
Professor Philip Nolan, a leading member of the public health advice team Nphet, warned yesterday that strict limits will be needed on Christmas get-togethers.
In an interview with the Sunday Business Post, Nolan warned that easing restrictions at Christmas risked a third wave of the virus in the new year. He said: “If we go back to the level of social contact we had in August and September, we are storing up difficulty for ourselves in January and February.

He said: “I can’t honestly say here today, in terms of what’s going to happen at Christmas.

Keane went with a defensive approach, introducing Brian Ó Beaglaoich as a late replacement for Stephen O’Brien on the half-forward line.
Ultimately the Kingdom paid a heavy price for their caution as Cork sealed a first championship victory in eight years over their dearest rivals following Mark Keane’s dramatic late intervention in extra-time.

“You look at the Kerry forwards, I’m talking about match winners. This is why I thought Kerry would win the game, you’re talking about David Clifford, Tony Brosnan, Seanie O’Shea, Stephen O’Brien who albeit didn’t start but came in.
“Killian Spillane came in and had an outstanding game. You look at the style of football. My own clubmate Brian Ó Beaglaoich, who’s a defender and played full-back in the 2014 All-Ireland minor final, was playing wing-forward. It’s a new system Kerry were playing that’s not attractive at all.
“To be honest with you, It’s not the Kerry way. Kerry have always been known for their traditional style of football, attractive football that you kick the ball, the ball would be moved at all times into players, creative players that can get scores and cause damage to defences. That’s something today that wasn’t there. David Clifford was deprived of early ball into him.
“Clifford was inside on his own 60 yards of space in front of him calling for the ball.
“I’d say he was looking for any type of ball to be kicked in and unfortunately it wasn’t I’m very disappointed with the way Kerry set-up, I think we’re better than that and in hindsight, I think if Peter had it all over again he’d change things up.”
While Ó Sé didn’t feel Keane was complacent coming into the game, he speculated that the Kerry players “could have possibly taken their eye off the ball.”
He continued: “Possibly looking at their body language by some of the players during the game, it’s certainly something that I saw and was worried about. Even their body language when they came out at extra-time, looking at Cork they were so revved up.

“Kerry weren’t as revved up as Cork, maybe that’s something Cork fed on. I wouldn’t say Peter Keane was complacent but it’s a very hard thing to do as players is block that out, how are you going to go towards this game, ‘Ah sure it’s only a game we have to show up, we’ve one hand on the cup here.’ 
“Possibly some of the players by their body language would have suggested they were complacent.
“Cork were far hungrier than Kerry. They went after the game, they wanted it more than Kerry. You come out of this game and say Cork are a hungry shower, they really went after it.”
Writing in his newspaper column before the game, Pat Spillane said he didn’t “give Cork a prayer” but the Rebels made a mockery of that prediction.
“There’s no doubt that Spillane played right into Cork’s barrow,” remarked Ó Sé. “Pat tries to stay relevant, he tries to sensationalise things. Killian Spillane was one of the outstanding players for Kerry today, he really stood up and he’s shown leadership.
“I was impressed with him in the All-Ireland last year, the goal he got, the way he was able to clinically put that ball beyond [Stephen] Cluxton – phenomenal stuff.
“I remember him as a Kerry minor and Pat coming out saying he was the best minor he’s seen in years and the best minor in Ireland so he was basically putting a bulls-eye on the back of his jersey.
“That has in no way hindered the young lad but from a journalistic point of view Pat just see himself putting his slant on it and he sensationalises things maybe and keeps the whole thing relevant.”

While incumbent Donald Trump has yet to concede and has launched several legal challenges, many world leaders congratulated Biden and running mate Kamala Harris after the Democrats were declared winners at the weekend and spontaneous celebrations erupted across American cities.
Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, dubbed “the Trump of the Tropics” for his populist, off-the-cuff style, has not made any public comment on Trump’s loss.
And Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has so far refused to congratulate Biden, saying he would wait until the legal challenges over the vote were resolved.
Russian President Vladimir Putin is waiting for official results from the US presidential election before congratulating a winner, according to the Kremlin.
“We consider it correct to wait for the official results to be finalised. I want to remind you that President Putin repeatedly said he will respect the choice of the American people,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. 
China also declined to congratulate Biden, saying the outcome of the vote was still to be determined.
Trump’s four years in the White House have been marked by a costly trade war and increasingly icy relations with China, with the two powers sparring over areas from blame for the Covid-19 pandemic to Beijing’s human rights record in Xinjiang and Hong Kong.
China said it had “noticed that Mr Biden declared he is the winner of the election.”
“Our understanding is that the outcome of the election will be determined in accordance with US laws and procedures,” foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told press at a regular briefing.
After declining to acknowledge Biden’s victory despite repeated questions from reporters, Wang said: “We hope the new US government can meet China halfway.”

Most Western allies welcomed a fresh start with Washington. Many have been dismayed at Trump’s criticism of the decades-old military and economic alliances.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin offered his congratulations to Biden following his win.
Martin said that he wanted to offer the “warmest congratulations to Joe Biden on his election as the 46th President of the United States”.
“Ireland takes pride in Joe Biden’s election, just as we are proud of all the generations of Irish women and Irish men and their ancestors whose toil and genius have enriched the diversity that powers America,” Martin said.

Today, German Chancellor Angela Merkel warmly offered to cooperate closely with Joe Biden after his election as the next US president, a sharp contrast to her stern warning to Donald Trump four years ago.
Underlining the President-elect’s “decades of experience in foreign policy” and recalling “good encounters and talks with him”, Merkel vowed to “stand together” with Washington to overcome international challenges – from the coronavirus pandemic to global warming.
“America is and remains our most important ally but it expects us, and rightly so, to boost our efforts and to ensure our own security and to stand up for our own convictions in the world,” added the German leader, who will step down next year.
Others expressed hope Biden might revive co-operation on health, climate and other issues following Trump’s rejection of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and pressure on Canada, Mexico, South Korea and other partners to renegotiate trade terms.
“I look forward to working with President-elect Biden, Vice President-elect Harris, their administration, and the United States Congress as we tackle the world’s greatest challenges together,” said Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, who was the target of personal insults from Trump.
In Asia, a region on edge about the strategic ambitions of China’s ruling Communist Party, the elected leaders of Japan, South Korea and Taiwan invoked “shared values” with Washington and expressed hope for close relations.
“I look forward to working with you to further strengthen the Japan-US Alliance and ensure peace, freedom, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond,” said Japanese prime minister Yoshihide Suga on Twitter.
President Moon Jae-in of South Korea said he looked forward to working together “for our shared values”.

The Reform think tank has written to the Electoral Commission to complain about the proposed name change, arguing it could lead to “voter confusion”.
The think tank, which argues for public service reform, has also written to Farage asking him to reconsider.
The Brexit Party has applied to the Electoral Commission to formally change its name, with Farage arguing that as well as keeping an eye on Boris Johnson’s negotiations with the EU “further reform in many other areas” is needed.
Party chairman Richard Tice has said a new coronavirus strategy is needed “so that we learn to live with it, not hide in fear of it”.
In its letter to Farage, Reform said: “We are determinedly independent and strictly non-party political.
As a charity, this independence is absolutely core to our reputation and work, and therefore the longstanding goodwill in our name.
It warned Farage that “renaming the Brexit Party ‘Reform UK’ risks undermining that goodwill through the confusion and/or presumed association with a political party”.
The think tank’s director Charlotte Pickles said: “We are flattered that Mr Farage would want to copy our name, however in doing so he is undermining almost two decades of work establishing our reputation for producing genuinely reformist and evidence-based policy research.

MINISTER FOR FOREIGN Affairs Simon Coveney has said “we are in the endgame” of Brexit talks as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson proceeds with his controversial Brexit bill.
Despite US president-elect Joe Biden having previously warned the UK over the draft legislation, Johnson told broadcasters that he intended to push ahead with the Internal Market Bill, with peers due to vote on it this week.
Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, Coveney described Biden as a “real friend to Ireland” who has made clear his position on the Good Friday Agreement in any Brexit negotiations. 
Coveney also said that Biden’s election could give the UK government “pause for thought” as Brexit talks near an end. 
“The US is a close ally of the UK, we know that, but I think the relationship between Donald Trump and Boris Johnson was a close one,” said Coveney.
“There was a lot of talk about a US-UK trade deal happening quickly. I think that the statements that have come, not only from Joe Biden, but from many on Capitol Hill that if the Good Friday Agreement and peace on the island of Ireland isn’t protected through Brexit that securing a trade deal between the US and the UK would be very, very problematic,” said Coveney. 
Meanwhile, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier is in London this week for talks with his UK counterpart Lord Frost as he seeks to “find an agreement that respects the interests and values of the EU and its 27 Member States”.
Biden, who has Irish heritage, in September warned that the Good Friday Agreement cannot be “a casualty of Brexit” and said a UK-US trade deal would be dependent on the peace terms being upheld.
Johnson, asked yesterday, whether he was determined to pass the bill in the face of Biden’s criticisms, said: “Yes, as I told Ursula (von der Leyen, European Commission president) the parliamentary timetable goes ahead.
“The whole point of that bill, and indeed the Finance Bill, is to protect and uphold the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process in Northern Ireland.
“And again, that’s one of the things that we’re united on with our friends in the White House.”
UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Britain had listened “very carefully to our American friends”, including those in the powerful Irish lobby in Washington, about their concerns regarding Brexit’s impact on Northern Ireland.

But Raab told BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show he remained “confident we will navigate all of those issues sensitively, correctly”.
Labour leader Keir Starmer, however, has called on Downing Street to scrap the Brexit bill if it wants to build a world-leading alliance with the Biden administration, which is due to be inaugurated in January.
“We will soon have a president in the Oval Office who has been a passionate advocate for the preservation of the Good Friday Agreement,” he wrote in an article for The Guardian.
“He, like governments across the world, will take a dim view if our Prime Minister ploughs ahead with proposals to undermine that agreement.
“If the Government is serious about a reset in its relationship with the United States, then it should take an early first step and drop these proposals.”

Alan Farrell accused Ross of showing “disdain” and “disinterest” in introducing legislation to regulate the use of the devices on Irish roads.
The Fine Gael TD is set to propose a new bill in the coming weeks to legalise the widespread use of e-scooters and e-bikes by bringing them in line with laws that apply to pedal bikes.
The private member’s Personal Light Electric Vehicle Bill, part of the Road Traffic Act, seeks to amend road traffic legislation to permit e-scooters and e-bikes as bicycles so that they would be exempt from insurance. Therefore, they could be used on public roads and cycle lanes.
At present, e-scooters and e-bikes are currently not regulated in Ireland. There is no specific law covering them.
They are considered to be mechanically-propelled vehicles, which means that if they are used in public places users must hold a licence and insurance.
Farrell said Mr Ross had shown “no political will” to rectify the grey area of their use during his time in office, despite the matter being on the department’s radar for three years.
“Minister Ross was a waste of time, and I mean absolute disrespect to him, in relation to the way in which he treated this project,” he said.
He added that Ross had treated e-scooters with “disdain and disinterest”.
“I think he put it back a number of years,” he said.
Ross last month published a tell-all book, titled In Bed with the Blueshirts, about his almost four years as a Cabinet minister.
It has drawn sharp criticism from Fine Gael ministers and TDs who have accused him of breaking Cabinet confidentiality.
Farrell argued e-scooters and e-bikes are now an “integral” part of the Irish transport system, describing them as a very workable, environmentally-friendly means of transport.
“Let’s be honest, they can be quite fun too,” he added.
The Dublin Fingal representative said he has a e-scooter but does not use it because of the ambiguous laws.

“I’m a 43-year-old parliamentarian and I have an electric scooter, and I don’t use it because I don’t want to be a parliamentarian who gets nicked on an illegal device,” he said.
“I would like to be able to jump on my electric scooter and scoot down the hill from my home, and get on the Dart, for example, and hop off at Pearse Street and zoom up to Leinster House three times a week. I would love not to use my car.”
Farrell added that under the Government’s current Covid-19 restrictions, it would make even more sense for people not to have to worry about getting public transport and to be able to get from A to B on an e-scooter.
Legislating for the use of e-scooters and e-bikes is one of the commitments in the Programme for Government as part of the coalition government’s bid to reduce carbon emissions.
Farrell said he believes the bill could be passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas by early next year. But he understands there are safety concerns associated with the devices and he has sought to address those concerns in the bill.
Earlier this month, the Road Safety Authority called on parents not to buy e-scooters for their children this Christmas, warning that in the hands of children they pose a high risk given they can travel at considerable speed.
The proposed bill would impose an upper speed limit of 25 kmph, an upper power limit of 250 watts, and a minimum age of 16 years.","Alan Farrell is set to propose a bill to legislate electric scooters and electric bikes on Irish roads.",11,0,0,45941,"Nov 9th 2020, 8:18 AM"
1005,228,"Rent costs rise in four of Ireland's five major cities",https://www.thejournal.ie/housing-crisis-ireland-rents-5260710-Nov2020/,"AVERAGE RENT PRICES rose by an average of 1.2% around the country in the three month period between June and September, according to new figures published today.
Four of Ireland’s five major cities have seen an increase in the average listed monthly rent cost compared to this time last year, Daft.ie has said in its quarterly Rental Report.
In Dublin city, monthly rent decreased slightly in the last quarter year-on-year, down 0.8% to €2,028.
However, the cost of rent rose up to around 5% compared to last year in Cork city, Galway city, Limerick city and Waterford city. 
Rent rose by 5.2% to a monthly average of €1,443 in Cork city, and by 5% in Waterford city to €1,058.
Galway city saw an increase of 4.9% to €1,443, while rents in Limerick city rose by 3.4% to €1,260.
The average national increase has offset a decrease of 1.4% seen earlier in the year during the second quarter in the immediate aftermath of the outbreak of Covid-19 in Ireland.
Rental supply in Dublin is almost twice as large as this time last year, rising from 2,700 to 1,400.
However, outside Dublin, rental supply is down by a third and reached its lowest level since 2006 at the start of November at just 1,435 properties available to rent beyond Dublin.
Economist at Trinity College and author of the report Ronan Lyons said that the figures highlight the “importance of supply in bringing about more affordable rents”.
“In Dublin, supply has increased this year, largely due to the impact of Covid-19, and rents are down slightly,” Lyons said.

“Elsewhere in the country, rental shortages continue to worsen and rents continue to rise to all-time highs. Even in Dublin, availability remains below 2006-2007 levels, a time of rental shortages, and at roughly one third the level of availability seen a decade ago,” he said.

“This underscores the importance of significant amounts of additional new rental supply – and not just in Dublin – in solving an issue that was central in the minds of voters earlier this year.”

TURN-OUT IN the US election has hit a 50-year high and eclipsed the record set in Barack Obama’s triumph in 2008, in what analysts are calling an extraordinary engagement in what amounted to a referendum on Donald Trump’s leadership.
The figures came as Trump maintained his silence despite earlier threats of legal action to prove voter fraud, a stance now interpreted as less about trying to change the result as providing an off-ramp for a loss the president cannot grasp.
With votes still being counted yesterday, the tallied ballots accounted for 62% of the eligible voting-age population in the US. That is a 0.4 percentage point increase so far over the rate hit in 2008, when the nation elected its first black president.
The sheer number of votes also set records, although that is a less remarkable milestone given the country’s growing population.
So far 148 million votes have been tallied, with Democrat Joe Biden winning more than 75 million — the highest number for a presidential candidate in history. Trump received more than 70 million — the highest total for a losing candidate.
Election experts and partisans are already debating the forces behind the swell of civic participation.
Some called the numbers a result of many states expanding the time and the ways in which voters could cast ballots. Others noted the extraordinary high passions Trump provoked — both for and against.
The result is the highest turn-out rate from eligible voters since 1968, according to data from the Associated Press (AP) and the United States Elections Project, which tracks turn-out. Experts think the 2020 rate could hit heights not seen since the beginning of the 20th century, before all women were allowed to vote.
“It’s hard to imagine we can get higher than this,” said Michael McDonald, a political scientist at the University of Florida who runs the Elections Project.
An AP analysis shows that some of the biggest turnout increases to date occurred in states that liberalised their mail-voting rules. In two states where it was expanded significantly, Montana and Vermont, turn-out rose by more than 10 and nine percentage points respectively on the previous presidential election, enough to put those states into the top 10 for increases.
Many of the states with the biggest turnout increases — including Arizona, Texas and Georgia — were new battlegrounds in the presidential race, places where Democrats sought to mobilise new voters and shift Republican strongholds.
President-elect Joe Biden leaves after mass on Sunday at St Joseph on the Brandywine Catholic Church in Wilmington, Delaware.
Meanwhile, Trump campaign aides, senior Republican officials and other allies have told AP the president’s threatened legal action is more about creating a more palatable exit strategy from the White House and keeping supporters on side than it is about proving electoral wrongdoing.
Trump has vowed to take legal steps while refusing to concede to Biden, and is making an aggressive pitch for donors to help finance any court battle.
He and his campaign have levelled accusations of large-scale voter fraud in Pennsylvania and other states that broke for Biden. So far they have been made without proof, but senior figures connected with the president say evidence of fraud is not really the point.
Aside from providing one pathway out of a defeat the president is struggling to accept, Trump aides and allies have also privately acknowledged the legal fights would at best forestall the inevitable.
Some told AP they also had deep reservations about the president’s attempts to undermine faith in the vote, but most agreed he and a core group of loyalists were aiming to keep his base of supporters on his side even in defeat.
“He intends to fight,” Trump’s economic adviser Larry Kudlow said as it was becoming clear that the president was headed for defeat.
Asked would Trump ever concede, the president’s long-time friend and adviser Roger Stone – whose prison sentence was commuted by Trump in July – said: “I doubt it.”

On Fox News Channel’s Sunday Morning Futures, Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani said two additional lawsuits were in the process of being drafted, in addition to existing litigation in Pennsylvania.
Giuliani predicted the campaign would have filed “four or five” lawsuits by the end of this week, with a total of 10 possible.
Lawyers could potentially argue certain vote tallies should be cast aside over fraud observed by poll watchers.
But in order to win that argument they would need evidence, not just allegations uttered so far that Republican count monitors were not allowed to see clearly enough.
Democratic poll watchers, who were also given the same access, have not raised concerns.
Even Trump’s own administration has pushed back at the claims of widespread voter fraud and illegal voting, while not mentioning it was Trump making the allegations.
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the federal body that oversees US election security, also noted local election offices had detection measures that “make it highly difficult to commit fraud through counterfeit ballots”.
Top election officials in the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Nevada – both Republican and Democrat – have all said they see no widespread voting irregularities, no major instances of fraud or illegal activity.","Republican figures believe the president’s threatened legal action is designed mainly to provide an off-ramp from an unpalatable defeat.",1,0,0,62308,"Nov 9th 2020, 7:32 AM"

Under the funding, some existing greenways will be improved and extended, and a new greenway bridge is to be constructed across the River Shannon in Athlone.
€10 million is to be put towards the Midleton-Youghal Greenway in Cork, with €9 million allocated to the Waterford-New Ross Greenway.
An expansion of the Great Western Way in Mayo will receive €5.15 million, while the TII in Galway-Athlone has been allocated €8.1 million and the Blessington Loop in Wicklow will receive €6.4 million.
Greenways in Kildare, Kerry, Offaly, Limerick, and Longford will also receive funding next year.
Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan said that the funding will provide a “step-change in the way in which we fund walking and cycling”.
“We will contribute a significant amount to the Great Southern Greenway in Limerick to support the work of the County Council in bringing the Greenway up to a modern standard,” Ryan said.
“This will ensure that cyclists will have a quality experience all the way from Rathkeale, Co Limerick to Listowel, Co Kerry.”
In Offaly, an extension of the Grand Canal Greenway from Daingean to Edenderry will be funded.
Ryan said the extension would mean that “by the end of next year it will be possible to cycle the Greenway the whole way from Edenderry to Lough Boora, over 50km worth of cycleway”.
Funding is to be put towards refurbishing the Longford Canal and providing improved infrastructure along the cycleway.
“We will also support the refurbishment of the disused New Ross to Waterford Railway as part of the Greenway connecting New Ross to Waterford City which incorporates the Kilkenny Greenway,” Ryan said.

“This cycleway will ultimately form part of an extensive cycling and walking network across the South East region and provide an environmentally friendly alternative for commuters into Waterford and New Ross.”
In Athlone, a Greenway bridge is to be constructed across the River Shannon as part of the Galway to Dublin Greenway.
Minister of State for Road Transport Hildegarde Naughton said that that the funding would “go a long way in delivering a safe and sustainable environment for active travel in our villages, towns and cities”.
“This investment will support even greater numbers enjoying our outdoors by cycling and walking for school, work and leisure,” Naughton said.
“We are also supporting the roll-out of a new Safe Routes to School Initiative. This programme will seek to accelerate the delivery of improved walking and cycling infrastructure to schools; enhance sustainable access onto school grounds; and expand the amount of cycle parking available at schools.”

Most kids have got with the programme. They now know not to hug their granny and not to share their sweets. They remember to wash their hands and to keep their distance but, inevitably, many of these children are starting to falter.
A different school life
Junior Infants often fall a little in love with their teachers but this hasn’t happened this year as all the teachers are masked up. These Junior Infants have not had the warm welcome from a comfy teacher that most of us enjoyed and have learned instead to live in a cold and complicated world where smiles are hidden and sharing is no longer caring; sharing is apparently killing your friends. 
I launched Level 5 with my kids by making fairy buns (sure what else would I be doing?) but then, unbeknownst to me, my eleven-year-old took it upon himself to sneak a bun into school for his best friend.
His friend was afraid to eat the bun and ceremoniously – and appropriately – gave it back to my little boy and washed his hands. Strange days when a fairy bun is akin to a thread to health and well-being.
The kids who are in secondary school are also having a weird and disconnected experience as they wear masks all day. New friendships are difficult to form when we are all trying to limit contact.
Extra-curricular activities have stopped. Birthday parties are a small muted affair. Halloween was all but cancelled and Christmas is looking a bit precarious. 
Long-term implications
We are now moving into a situation where there will be a significant long-term psychological impact on this generation. Children are learning to fear other people and are becoming understandably germ-phobic.
The extraordinary reliance on screens to get us through this crisis will have a long-term impact. College kids already hate their online classes and many will drop out. 
There is an estimated 50% unemployment for the younger generation who are already under the cosh of the financial implications of the bank bailout during the global recession and are now on course to inherit the financial burden caused by this pandemic. 
They can’t get a job to pay for college by working in bars or restaurants. Few of them will ever be able to buy a house. This is the first generation – ever – that expects to be poorer than their parents.

My food addiction: How group therapy helped me overcome years of bingeing and purging
But it is not only financial stress and isolation that are causing distress – the intergenerational fallout from the pernicious idea that young people’s parties are killing their grandparents is creating a weird animosity – this time it isn’t brother against brother but teenager against granny.
The teenagers are told that they are selfish for wanting to meet their boyfriend or their girlfriend and that they are lucky to be able to have the technology to get an education from their bedroom.
But they aren’t lucky; they’re suffering. They feel isolated, bored and anxious; they are losing friendships; their parents’ small businesses are going bankrupt; their education is a turgid affair and their reliance on technology is becoming an uncontrollable beast.
It’s hard to keep your spirits up when you feel lonely, disconnected and frightened. Human connection keeps us mentally strong and this is why we need it; the famous ‘Blitz spirit’ during World War II was nurtured from a sense of community.
An end in sight
It has been shown that mankind can handle almost anything so long as we have a reason ‘why’. But now that even the medical experts are arguing about which is the best way to move forward when it comes to Covid-19, our reason why is becoming hazy. 
We need to centre our mental health into all future decisions as we can’t continuously squeeze all the fun out of life without some emotional fallout. We need our friends, we need our communities and we need to have celebrations that lift us out of the daily grind. 
When Covid-19 first struck, we were willing to do almost anything to fight it. The Spanish stayed in their apartments for months. The French closed down society. The Italians perhaps suffered the most in Europe and the haunting video clips from Italy encouraged most of us to follow the rules and do what we were told.
We did our best despite the challenges to our mental health because we understood that we were in the middle of a pandemic and needs must. Meanwhile Sweden rolled out a different approach and now, eight months later, few of us feel the same sense of clarity as we did last March.
Now we’re not so sure that we are in the middle of a pandemic – indeed many of us think that maybe we’re at the very beginning of one. Others believe we’re at the beginning of the end – who knows?

None of us can guess what lies in store for us in 2021 or even 2022. The alluring idea that we would ‘get Covid done’ – just like the British hoped that they would ‘get Brexit done’ – has faded away to a wisp of smoke.
We now realise that we are unlikely to get rid of Covid, and so we need instead to adjust our minds and centre our emotional health by learning to live alongside it.

PRESIDENT-ELECT JOE Biden signalled on Sunday that he plans to move quickly to build out his government, focusing first on the pandemic that will likely dominate the early days of his administration.
Biden named a former surgeon general, Dr Vivek Murthy, and a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner, David Kessler, as co-chairs of a coronavirus working group set to get started, with other members expected to be announced on Monday.
Transition team officials said that also this week Biden would launch his agency review teams, the group of transition staffers that have access to key agencies in the current administration to ease the transfer of power.
The teams would collect and review information such as budgetary and staffing decisions, pending regulations and other work in progress from current staff at the departments to help Mr Biden’s team prepare to transition.
“People want the country to move forward,” said Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, in an interview on NBC’s Meet The Press, and see Biden and vice president-elect Kamala Harris “have the opportunity to do the work, to get the virus under control and to get our economy back together”.
It is unclear for now whether president Donald Trump and his administration will co-operate. He has yet to acknowledge Biden’s victory and has pledged to mount legal challenges in several closely contested states that decided the race.
On Sunday afternoon, a bipartisan group from the last three White Houses urged the Trump administration to move forward “to immediately begin the post-election transition process”.
The call came from the Centre for Presidential Transition advisory board and was signed by officials from the administrations of Republican president George W Bush and Democrats Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.
“This was a hard-fought campaign, but history is replete with examples of presidents who emerged from such campaigns to graciously assist their successors,” members of the advisory board said in a statement.
Formal recognition of a new administration by its predecessor is necessary to free up money needed for the handover of power and trigger the transition process at government agencies. 
There were signs that leaders in Washington and abroad were preparing for a new administration.
Biden’s aides said the president-elect and transition team had been in touch with Republican politicians.
Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, one of Trump’s closest allies, opened a Cabinet meeting on Sunday by congratulating Biden, a former vice president and long-time senator.
“I have a long and warm personal connection with Joe Biden for nearly 40 years, and I know him as a great friend of the state of Israel,” Netanyahu said.

“I am certain that we will continue to work with both of them in order to further strengthen the special alliance between Israel and the US.”
Bush, the sole living Republican former president, also wished Biden well.
“Though we have political differences, I know Joe Biden to be a good man, who has won his opportunity to lead and unify our country,” Bush said.
Biden faces key staffing decisions in the days ahead. The 10-week transition period before Inauguration Day on January 20 has already been shortened by the extra time it has taken to determine the winner of Tuesday’s election.
The second Catholic to be elected president, Mr Biden started his first full day as president-elect by attending church at St Joseph on the Brandywine near his home in Wilmington, as he does nearly every week.
After the service, he visited the church cemetery where several family members have been laid to rest, including his late son, Beau.
Beau Biden, a former Delaware attorney general, died in 2015 from cancer. Before his death, he had encouraged his father to make a third run for the White House.
Biden said in a victory speech on Saturday that he would announce a task force of scientists and experts on Monday to develop a “blueprint” to begin beating back the virus by the time he assumes the presidency.
He said his plan would be “built on bedrock science” and “constructed out of compassion, empathy and concern”.

Biden’s senior adviser Ted Kaufman said the transition team would focus on the “nuts and bolts” of building the new administration in coming days.
Biden may not make top Cabinet choices for weeks. But he built his presidential run around bipartisanship and he has spent the days since Tuesday’s election pledging to be a president for all Americans. That suggests he could be willing to appoint some Republicans to high-profile administration positions.
Many former Republican officeholders broke with Trump to endorse Biden’s campaign. Biden’s selection of some of them to join the new government could appease Senate Republicans, who may have to confirm many of Biden’s choices for top jobs. The Republican Party could retain control of the chamber after two special elections in Georgia on January 5.
Still, too much across-the-aisle co-operation could draw the ire of progressives. Some already worry that unco-operative Senate Republicans could force Mr Biden to scale back his ambitious campaign promises to expand access to health care and lead a post-pandemic economic recovery that relies on federal investment in green technology and jobs to help combat climate change.
Biden’s efforts at bipartisan reconciliation could still be derailed by Trump’s refusal to concede the race.
Symone Sanders, a Biden campaign senior adviser, said that while several Republican politicians had been in contact with the president-elect in recent days, the campaign had yet to hear from Trump White House officials.
Republican Senator Mitt Romney said Trump had a right to pursue recounts and legal challenges. But he noted that those efforts would be unlikely to change the outcome and he urged the president to dial back his rhetoric.","Donald Trump has yet to acknowledge Joe Biden’s victory and vowed to mount legal challenges in several closely contested states that decided the race.",3,0,0,21768,"Nov 9th 2020, 6:49 AM"

1011,191,"Stephen Kenny: Ireland can't dwell on loss of Rice and Grealish against England",https://www.the42.ie/stephen-kenny-25-5260495-Nov2020/,"THURSDAY’S INTERNATIONAL FRIENDLY at Wembley may feature a couple of familiar faces, with Declan Rice and Jack Grealish included in the England squad for the game.
Grealish and Rice played for Irish at various underage levels for Ireland up to U21 level while Rice also played three times for the Irish senior squad before both decided to represent the country of their birth.
Stephen Kenny, however, is not spending any time wondering what might have been had the Premier League duo stuck with Ireland.
“They are obviously both very good players. I’m very happy with the players we’ve got. We’ve got a lot of talent coming through. We’re got a lot of young players, a lot of talent and we’re not far away from being a very good side. 
“I can’t worry about other players who could have been part of the equation. They are obviously good players but we can’t dwell on that and we have to look forward and see what other players are coming through and will emerge.” 
In an interview with Eamon Dunphy last year, Kenny spoke of his belief that Rice and Grealish would still be involved with Ireland had they been promoted to the senior set-up earlier as a result of better co-ordination with the underage ranks.

When he was asked today what he could do to prevent Irish underage players defecting to England in the future, he was less specific and spoke in broad terms about the issue he identified last year. 
“I can’t make promises that I may not be able to fulfill. What we can do is try to make the environment at all ages and levels as professional as possible, and make sure there is a clear pathway between U15s and the senior international team. 
“To make sure that if players are exceptional they move up the ages quicker to accelerate their development. I think that’s very important. If players can play at U21 level at 17 and they excel, well then they can become first team players soon enough.

“Really that’s how I see it. Try and create an environment that players can really identify with, an identity for the Irish team. To be fair, all the players really love playing for Ireland at all the age groups.
“There can be some misinformation nowadays that players are not as committed. That is not what I experienced when I came in. I found that when players were left out of squads they were genuinely devastated. They were desperate to play.” 
Thursday’s friendly with England prefaces the closing Uefa Nations League games with Wales and Bulgaria, and answered a question as to whether he would be experimenting in the first game by pointing out the number of players he has picked in his five games thus far. 
“We have been experimenting. We have used a lot of players in those early games that will stand us in good stead in the World Cup qualifiers in March. Jayson Molumby has made his debut, Jason Knight, Dara O’Shea, Aaron Connolly, Adam Idah too, so there have been a lot of players who have come in and got experience which we will reap the benefits of in the World Cup qualifiers in March. 
“There is no point blooding them then, in the campaign. Certainly they are getting an opportunity now and some have shown they are very capable and will be part of the future for Ireland, for sure.” 
With Seamus Coleman fit having missed the October internationals, Kenny talked of how he may fit both into the same team, something he sees possible not only in a 3-5-2 formation but also a 4-2-3-1, the system Ireland used for much of last month’s Euro 2020 playoff with Slovakia. 
Matt Doherty played on the left-sided centre back for a lot of the game against Wales, that was obviously due to a lot of injuries, and Seamus has played on the right side of a back three for Everton. They can both play along the right side, though maybe not in a 4-3-3. When we played 4-3-3 earlier, your wide players are supporting the striker, making runs across the line and being dynamic, playing narrow and so forth. 
“But in an orthodox 4-3-2-1 they can both play on the right, for sure.” 
The Irish squad are gathering in London today, where they will base themselves ahead of the England game. The only injury concern so far is Enda Stevens, who will be assessed having sustained a knee injury playing for Sheffield United against Chelsea yesterday.

Keane struck a 91st minute goal to clinch a sensational extra-time win for Cork and dump Kerry out of the 2020 championship at Páirc Uí Chaoimh.
The 20-year-old made his AFL debut for Collingwood in early August but McCarthy was eager to bring him on board once the Mitchelstown man was back in Ireland.
“It’s funny the way things work but I suppose we had no hesitation in bringing him in but Mark has huge interest in Cork football. He’s played underage all the way up and even when he’s been away he’s been interested in the team and stays in touch with us and the minute he was back he wanted to play.
“We brought him in and it was evident to me he was going to be an addition to us and the way it worked out today was great. The first thing is the player wants to play, that’s the first thing, and then the second thing is that we did our business properly with Collingwood.
“We sought permission from them for him to play and they gave it to us and we’re very grateful for it but ultimately, Mark has a huge interest in Cork football.
“I think he’s back about six weeks but obviously he needed to self-isolate when he was back. He’s back about six weeks. He’s back nearly as long as we’re back but obviously he couldn’t train with us the first couple of weeks.
“I suppose the goal at the end even shows, and I think it was Tommy Walsh actually inside under him as well, he’s a great target for long balls. He’s a good passer of the ball. He’s a great target man, great physical presence and, look, he has just added to the quality and depth to the group.”

The victory is a seismic one for this Cork squad, eight years after their last success over Kerry in a senior championship outing. McCarthy praised his players for their input.
“I think the thing about this group is that everybody who’s there, they’re 100% committed to Cork football and that hasn’t been the case over the last four or five years. People thought there were pastures greener and this group here, Cork football is their number one priority.
“I suppose Cork haven’t beaten a top eight team never mind a top tier team since I think 2012. So it’s brilliant to make the breakthrough and it’s great that the players got what they deserved and I think the manner of the win as well, that we were behind in normal time and got back and the way we won it as well is testament to the group.”
The focus will soon shift to the Munster final on 22 November against Tipperary.

“We never got too excited in days we were beaten, and there were very dark days, let’s be fair this team were beaten by 17 points two years ago, 15 by Tyrone, relegated to Division 3.

But obviously at some point their confidence was shattered from various games, so what I’ll say is we never get too excited either way.

Jeopardy! bills itself as “America’s favourite quiz show” and captivated the public with a unique format in which contestants were told the answers and had to provide the questions on a variety of subjects, including films, politics, history and popular culture.
Trebek, who became its host in 1984, was a master of the format, engaging in friendly banter with contestants, appearing genuinely pleased when they answered correctly and, at the same time, moving the game along in a brisk no-nonsense fashion whenever people struggled for answers.
He never pretended to know the answers himself if he really did not, deferring to the show’s experts to decide whether a vague answer had come close enough to be counted as correct.
“I try not to take myself too seriously,” he told an interviewer in 2004. “I don’t want to come off as a pompous ass and indicate that I know everything when I don’t.”
The show was the brainstorm of Julann Griffin, wife of the late talk show host-entrepreneur Merv Griffin, who said she suggested to him one day that he create a game show where people were given the answers.
Jeopardy! debuted on NBC in 1964 with Art Fleming as emcee and was an immediate hit. It lasted until 1975, then was revived in syndication with Trebek.
Trebeck won five Emmys as the host of Jeopardy! and received stars on both the Hollywood and Canadian walks of fame. In 2012, the show won a prestigious Peabody Award.","Alex Trebek had announced in 2019 that he had advanced pancreatic cancer.",6,0,0,26431,"Nov 8th 2020, 7:27 PM"

(After extra-time)
AFL PLAYER MARK Keane struck a goal with the last kick of the game to give Cork victory over Kerry in extraordinary fashion in the Munster senior football semi-fina today.
It clinched a first victory for Cork in eight years in a senior championship outing and dumped the Kingdom out of the 2020 race in an amazing late twist to a grinding battle in the rain on Leeside.
With Cork trailing by a point, Luke Connolly hoisted an attempt in the 91st minute from the left wing. His kick hung short where Keane was lurking inside and he outmuscled the Kerry defence before booting home a goal that clinched a remarkable win.
The stands may have been empty, the stadium enveloped in darkness and the torrential showers impeded prospects of free-flowing play, yet it was gripping stuff in normal time with outcome in doubt.
Kerry at last tapped into the scoring potential of their forward line in the closing quarter. Spillane and Sean O’Shea were the key performers as they contributed Kerry’s final four points of the game evenly between them.
Afer a monumental show of effort, Cork seemed set for defeat but they managed to dig out a draw. Connolly spun over a shot off his right and after Sean Powter was felled, Mark Collins nailed the 73rd minute free to leave the teams locked at 0-10 apiece.
Cork chalked up one point in the opening 18 minutes but those struggles preceded a stronger phase. They gained a real foothold around the middle and pinned Kerry back in their own half. Killian O’Hanlon and Ian Maguire were particularly prominent with that productive spell reflected in the last three points of the half. Mark Collins from a free, O’Hanlon from a ’45 and Kevin O’Donovan raiding from defence were all on target to nudge them in front 0-6 to 0-5.

The first half had been an arm wrestle in trying conditions on a greasy pitch. Kerry were 0-2 to 0-1 ahead by the water break and must have wondered how their advantage was so narrow. 
Brian Ó Beaglaoich, a late inclusion for Stephen O’Brien, cut clear for a glorious goal chance in the 14th minute but Michael Martin beat away his blasted shot. Ronan Buckley tapped the rebound over the bar but in general Kerry spurned point scoring chances with their threats of Sean O’Shea and Tony Brosnan unusally inaccurate as shots fell short.
Newcomer Maurice Shanley was policing David Clifford and the star turn from Fossa was the one forward on song as he rifled over two scores from play in the first half.
But Kerry’s shooting was poor compared to the usual high levels as they coughed up chances throughout. That allowed Cork to stay in contention and peg them back in normal time.
In extra-time the brilliance of Spillane in front of goal seemed destined to nudge Kerry over the line. They were 0-13 to 0-11 clear when he hooked over a shot in the 82nd minute.
Cork kept coming with Connolly trimming the gap as he stroked over a superb free from the left and then he provided an unlikely assist for Keane’s famous late strike.

The champions, fielding a four-man attack, took an early lead in a gripping Premier League contest at the Etihad Stadium when Salah struck after a foul by Kyle Walker on Sadio Mane.
City responded with a fine goal from fit-again Jesus but De Bruyne spurned the chance to put them ahead when he fired wide from 12 yards before the break.
Both sides had opportunities in the second half but neither could break through, meaning Liverpool dropped from first to third over the course of the weekend while City remained in mid-table.
Reds boss Jurgen Klopp had made a bold call by fitting the in-form Diogo Jota into his side alongside the feared front three of Salah, Mane and Roberto Firmino, and gave them all equal licence to attack.
Playing in what appeared a 4-2-4 formation, the visitors went straight onto the front foot. They created a chance within the opening minute as Firmino raced in on goal from a long ball but Ederson just did enough to put him off.
That set the tempo for the opening stages and Liverpool were rewarded for their aggressive and positive start with a penalty after 13 minutes.
There were few complaints when Craig Pawson pointed to the spot after Walker – derided as “an idiot” after the challenge by TV pundit Roy Keane – clipped Mane. Salah made City pay the price by smashing home from the spot.
Another rapid Liverpool break led to Salah teeing up Mane in the box but Ruben Dias blocked.
City eventually began to settle and get De Bruyne on the ball. It was the Belgian who created their first chance when he picked out Raheem Sterling at the far post but the England forward, in cutting inside to shoot on his right foot, allowed Alisson Becker to make the save.

City levelled just before the half-hour mark as De Bruyne fed Jesus with his back to goal. The City striker, starting for the first time since September, beat Trent Alexander-Arnold with a clever flick and turn and then poked past Alisson.
De Bruyne drove wide from distance moments later and then had an even better chance to put City ahead when City were awarded a penalty before the break. After a lengthy VAR review that involved Pawson going to the monitor, Joe Gomez was adjudged to have handled as he tried to pull his arm away from a De Bruyne cross. Liverpool contested the decision but escaped damage as De Bruyne rolled his shot wide.
Liverpool almost took advantage of the miss to score themselves as Ederson allowed an Alexander-Arnold shot to squirm from his grasp and roll towards the line, but he grabbed at the second attempt as Jota swooped in.
The second half began at the same breathtaking pace with Andrew Robertson and De Bruyne having shots saved at either hand.
Jesus then had a glorious chance from a Joao Cancelo cross but put a free header wide.
Liverpool suffered a blow after the hour when Alexander-Arnold dropped to the ground injured. He was replaced by James Milner and he may now be doubtful for England next week.
Perhaps inevitably, the frenetic pace dropped in the latter stages and both sides had to settle for a point.","Kevin De Bruyne was left to rue sending a spot kick wide.",1,0,0,32798,"Nov 8th 2020, 6:25 PM"

A total of more than 50,010,400 cases, including 1,251,980 deaths, have been recorded globally since the pandemic erupted in China in December last year.
Europe, with 12.6 million confirmed cases for more than 305,700 deaths, has once again become the epicentre of the pandemic.
Last week, out of the more than 3.9 million new cases recorded in the world, more than half (2.1 million) were in the 52 countries of the European continent.
In the last seven days, the European countries that registered the largest number of new infections were France with 381,000 new cases, Italy (223,000), the United Kingdom (160,000), Poland (159,000) and Spain (143,000).
The United States, which experienced a slight respite over the summer, has seen the number of daily infections top  100,000 cases for the last few days. 
The country is approaching 10 million confirmed cases and more than 237,000 deaths, or a fifth of all the infections detected in the world.

Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan said yesterday that the “commitment to the spirit of the public health advice shown by people across Ireland since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic is to be commended”.
“This includes wearing a face mask where social distancing is difficult, in shops and on public transport,” Holohan said.
“However, it is also vital that they are worn correctly and safely. Ensure you are fully covering both your mouth and nose with the face mask. Remember, visors do not offer the same benefits as face masks,” he said.
“I want to particularly highlight that it is very important that those who work in settings such as retail avoid the use of visors and instead use face masks. Face masks offer far better protection, and they should be worn by everyone who can wear them. Wearing one prevents someone who does not know they have Covid-19 from spreading it to another person.”
“They are a key element of our defence against this virus, alongside staying at home and avoiding meeting people outside your household.” ","Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan has said that is crucial to use face masks correctly, particularly in retail settings.",41,0,0,108213,"Nov 8th 2020, 5:50 PM"
1020,193,"Thai police use water cannon to stop pro-democracy march to palace",https://www.thejournal.ie/thai-police-water-cannon-march-5260272-Nov2020/,"THAI POLICE HAVE fired water cannons on pro-democracy protesters who were trying to march to the royal palace to deliver letters demanding reform to the unassailable monarchy.
Student-led rallies have rocked the kingdom since July, with protesters calling for the removal of government head Prayut Chan-O-Cha — a former army chief who came into power through a 2014 coup — and a rewrite to the military-scripted constitution. 
The boldest in the leaderless movement have also demanded reforms to the monarchy — a once-taboo issue — sending shockwaves through Thailand’s arch-royalist establishment.
Nearly 7,000 protesters — a police estimate — attempted to march from Bangkok’s historic Democracy Monument to the Grand Palace today to deliver letters to King Maha Vajiralongkorn, with security forces calling for them to stop.
As the marchers got closer, police briefly fired water cannons at them. The protesters reacted angrily, shouting: “Why did you use the water cannons against us?”
Authorities had warned earlier in the day that protesters were banned from breaching a 150-metre radius around the palace, and some 9,000 officials were deployed.
Police defended their brief use of water cannon late Sunday night, saying it was just “a warning”.
“Authorities had no intention to cause any harm,” deputy police spokesman Colonel Kissana Phathanacharoen said in a press briefing, adding that only “clean water” was used.
Today’s confrontation was the second time police have deployed water cannons against protesters.
Last month, a peaceful rally in downtown Bangkok saw protesters blasted with chemical-laced liquid as police bore down — images that shocked many in Thailand.
Since then, demonstrators have appeared prepared for any retaliation from authorities, bringing along umbrellas, goggles, and even hard hats.
The movement has also borrowed tactics from Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protesters, who shared tips on Twitter using trending hashtags on how to react to police crackdowns.
The youth-led movement’s direct challenge to the monarchy is unprecedented in Thailand, where King Maha Vajiralongkorn sits at the apex of power supported by a coup-happy military and its billionaire clans. 
Among the students’ demands are the abolition of a royal defamation law — which shields the monarch from criticism — a clear accounting of the palace’s finances, and for the king to “stay out” of Thailand’s turbulent politics.
The king last week addressed a reporter’s question on the non-stop protests across the capital, declaring “love” for all Thais and saying that “Thailand is the land of compromise”. 
But a protest leader today said the use of water cannon on marchers was not acceptable.
“We came to submit our letters,” Jutatip Sirikhan told reporters after the confrontation. 
“No matter what, we will not step back,” she said as protesters chanted “slaves to dictatorship” at security forces who watched on.

Organisers had brought along crimson-coloured homemade mailboxes — with the words “Royal Household Bureau” emblazoned across them — for protesters to submit their letters to the king.
Police allowed them to leave the mailboxes outside the Supreme Court, and most protesters dispersed around 9 pm local time.
Before the march to the palace, the rally at the Democracy Monument was peaceful with protesters chanting “Prayut, get out” and holding up a three-finger salute — a symbol of the movement.
They also threw flowers into a makeshift cardboard coffin carrying a life-sized mannequin with Prayut’s face. Some scrawled messages on it, including “go to hell”.
Earlier today, prominent pro-democracy figures called on the king to listen to the protesters.
“We hope you will change your behaviour once and for all and become a King of all people,” wrote lawyer Anon Numpa, one of the most recognisable faces in the movement.
“I hope Your Majesty will open your mind and reach out to dialogue with us to solve the crises together.”
The unprecedented demands to Thailand’s ultra-wealthy monarch have infuriated pro-royalist groups, and they have retaliated with counter-rallies.
A smaller group of the king’s supporters came out to the Democracy Monument holding portraits of King Vajiralongkorn, but they left after they were outnumbered by the protesters.","Student-led rallies are calling for the removal of Thailand’s head of government.",4,0,0,16292,"Nov 8th 2020, 4:45 PM"

Eta breached Cuba even as searchers in Guatemala were still digging for people believed to have been buried by a massive, rain-fuelled landslide.
Authorities have said that 15 people are confirmed dead and at least 109 are missing in Guatemala, many of them in the landslide in San Cristobal Verapaz.
Pope Francis spoke today about the population of Central America, hit “by a violent hurricane, which has caused many victims and huge damage, worsened as well by the already difficult situation due to the pandemic”.
Speaking to people gathered in St Peter’s Square, Pope Francis prayed that “the Lord welcome the deceased, comfort their families and sustain … all those who are doing their best to help them”.
The US National Hurricane Centre issued tropical storm warnings for southern Florida and the Florida Keys, and warnings were issued for central Cuba, parts of southern Florida and the Keys were put under a hurricane watch.
The Hurricane Centre said Eta was located about 60 miles (95km) southwest of Canagua, Cuba, on Sunday morning and was moving north-northeast at 12mph (19kph). Maximum sustained winds had decreased slightly to 60mph (95kph). The system was expected to approach the Florida Keys and south Florida late today or tomorrow. 
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency yesterday for eight counties at the end of the state as Eta approached, urging residents to stock up on supplies. South Florida started emptying ports and a small number of shelters opened in Miami and the Florida Keys for residents in mobile homes and low-lying areas.

Miami-Dade County declared a state of emergency on Friday night and also warned that a flood watch would be in effect through to Tuesday night.
Further south in the Keys, officials were monitoring the storm closely, but had no plans yet to evacuate tourists or residents. They urged residents to secure their boats and encouraged visitors to consider altering plans until Eta had passed.
“Residents need to monitor this storm and be prepared for high tropical storm force sustained winds and hurricane strength gusts,” said Shannon Wiener, Monroe County emergency management director.
Eta was once a Category 4 hurricane, and authorities from Panama to Mexico were still surveying the damage following days of torrential rains during the week.
In Guatemala, search teams first had to overcome multiple landslides and deep mud just to reach the site where officials have estimated some 150 homes were devastated.
In the worst-hit village, Queja, at least five bodies have been pulled from the mud. The indigenous community of about 1,200 residents consisted of simple homes of wood and tin roofs clinging to the mountainside.
In southern Mexico, across the border from Guatemala, 20 people died as heavy rains attributed to Eta caused mudslides and swelled streams and rivers, according to a Chiapas state civil defence official.
The worst incident in Mexico occurred in the mountain township of Chenalho, where 10 people were swept away by a rain-swollen stream – their bodies were later found downstream.","Fifteen people were confirmed dead and at least 109 were missing, many of them in a landslide, authorities in Guatemala said.",5,0,0,15512,"Nov 8th 2020, 3:36 PM"

Professor Philip Nolan, a leading member of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), warned today that strict limits will be needed on Christmas get-togethers.
Junior Minister Robert Troy failed to provide any clarity when asked about the remarks, saying the situation would be kept “under review”.
He said: “I can’t honestly say here today, in terms of what’s going to happen at Christmas.
“Only to say that the government with NPHET, with the public health advice, are keeping the situation under constant review to ensure that we can open up the economy as much as possible in December, and to ensure that we can have as good a Christmas as possible under the circumstances.”
He added:
Christmas will not be the same as previous Christmases, it can’t be the same as previous Christmases. This is a highly contagious disease.
Sinn Féin TD Kathleen Funchion told RTÉ’s The Week In Politics that the government had to provide more clarity to allow people to plan for the festive season.
She said: “People were told for the last number of weeks that they had to go into Level 5 to sort of save Christmas. Now we’re seeing that it’s going to be very restricted anyway.
“I think the vast majority of people understand that the regulations are in place for a reason and want to follow them.
But there does need to be a lot more in terms of planning and telling people what exactly it’s going to look like if they are going to restrict people in relation to Christmas and Christmas visits.
In an interview with the Sunday Business Post, Professor Philip Nolan warned that easing restrictions at Christmas risked a third wave of the virus in the new year.
He said: “If we go back to the level of social contact we had in August and September, we are storing up difficulty for ourselves in January and February.”
Dr Nuala O’Connor, the Irish College of General Practitioners’ lead adviser on Covid-19, said the focus this year will be on a “safe” Christmas.
She told Newstalk Breakfast: “I think we’ve all got to think carefully as a society how we’re going to manage Christmas this year.
“Christmas is really important in Ireland. What we have to do is try and focus on how we can have Christmas but in a safer manner.

“We now know how to get these virus numbers down and how to keep them down and it’s really about narrowing the amount of people we meet on a regular basis.
“We also need to focus on how we can meet people safely.
“Yes, Christmas will be a bit different because if we try to have it the normal way, if there’s too much getting together of people in closed, crowded, poorly ventilated indoor spaces, that’s exactly where this virus loves to spread.
“We have to start thinking positively and be creative and inventive on how we can get together safely and have that connection with friends and family.”

It took place 33 years to the day since the IRA’s “Poppy Day” bomb attack at the Enniskillen war memorial.
Eleven people who had gathered to pay respects to the war dead were killed and dozens more were injured in the no-warning blast in 1987 just minutes before the event was due to start. A 12th victim of the bombing died 13 years later having never woken from a coma. 
Relatives of some of those killed attended Sunday-morning’s event.
Stephen Gault, whose father Samuel was murdered, said the smaller numbers in attendance made it more poignant.
“It’s hard to believe that on this exact day 33 years ago that my father and other 11 innocent people were brutally murdered at this site,” he said.

“It’s very poignant. It made it hit home. It was smaller numbers but it doesn’t take away from the day.”
Gault praised Martin for attending.
“It was great the Taoiseach was able to come and carry on the tradition set a number of years ago,” Gault said.
“I personally think it’s greatly appreciated that he’s carried on that tradition, particularly as it’s a different Taoiseach this year from previous years.”
Enda Kenny became the first Taoiseach to attend a Remembrance Day service in Northern Ireland when he took part in commemorations at Enniskillen in 2012.
That move was symbolic of the greater recognition now afforded in the Republic of Ireland to those Irishmen who fought and died serving in the British Army in the First World War.
Other small-scale Remembrance Day events took place elsewhere in Northern Ireland on Sunday, including at the Cenotaph at Belfast City Hall, where Lord Mayor Frank McCoubrey led the commemorations.

The UK Foreign Secretary added he believed the government would be able to allay American fears and navigate the Northern Ireland issue to satisfy allies in the US following Joe Biden’s presidential election win.
It comes as Boris Johnson and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen agreed during a phone call on Saturday to “redouble efforts” to reach a UK-EU trade deal and signed off on talks continuing next week.
Downing Street said the Prime Minister had told his Brussels counterpart that there remained “significant differences” in the UK-EU negotiations, with the two sides continuing to be apart on their positions over fishing rights and a level playing field agreement.
The call follows two weeks of intensified talks between the UK’s chief negotiator Lord Frost and his European Union equivalent Michel Barnier ahead of further discussions between the pair in London next week.
Rabb told BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show: “We’ve been very clear we are absolutely committed to respect the Good Friday Agreement but our argument is, and it was good to have the opportunity when I was in Washington to explain, it is the EU who has put pressure on that with the approach it has taken.
“We want to resolve all those issues with the EU – obviously the negotiations are ongoing, there is a good chance of a deal if we get the flexibility from the EU on fisheries and level-playing field.
“I’m confident we will navigate all of those issues sensitively, correctly, and, as I said, we listen very carefully to our American friends, particularly on the Hill and in the Irish lobby – they feel very invested in the Good Friday Agreement, we understand that, and I pay tribute to what George Mitchell and Bill Clinton did – but it is not the UK which is putting it at risk, it is the approach of the EU.”
Asked whether a trade deal could be secured with the EU by the end of the week, the Foreign Secretary added: “I wouldn’t make assumptions, that is the one thing we know about the Brexit process.
“I spoke to David Frost yesterday, the issues are where they are. The Prime Minister has spoken to Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the Commission, and negotiations are ongoing.
“What I would say is that it still boils down to two basic issues. There is progress being made but we’ve got to see whether it is enough to get us over the line.
“There are some core interests at stake for the UK, points of democratic principle around control of our laws, control of our fisheries as an independent coastal state.

“I don’t think we can toss those aside. But if the EU shows the flexibility, the good will to meet us halfway, I am confident a deal can still be done.”
Johnson and von der Leyen’s conversation last month led to discussions being “intensified” before a fallout after the European Council meeting on 15 October briefly derailed the negotiations.
UK chief negotiator Lord Frost was in the Belgian capital to speak face-to-face with his European Union counterpart Barnier earlier this week as the deadline for doing a deal edges closer.
After Saturday’s phone call, Lord Frost tweeted: “Prime Minister Boris Johnson and commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke today about our negotiations with the EU.
“My talks with Michel Barnier will continue in London on Monday.”","He said he believed a deal with the EU could still be done if the latter shows ‘flexibility’ and ‘good will’.",6,0,0,18926,"Nov 8th 2020, 12:03 PM"

Jack Charlton’s Irish team were successful but freighted with more meaning than most football teams have ever been: styled as emblems of a new Ireland in which the world could see the tricolour flown in benign and friendly hands. 
The truth of that mythmaking remains open to debate, but Wembley ’91 proved these stories we told ourselves about that Irish team weren’t read widely elsewhere.
If we were moving on from the past, then some of those around us weren’t quite ready. 
The day began with 200 English fans attacking Irish supporters drinking in the Black Lion pub, a clash which left five injured and eight arrested.

Charlton, meanwhile, was returning to the turf on which he won England’s only World Cup but was barracked and booed, assailing by chants of “Judas.”
He was deeply hurt, muttering to Tony Cascarino in grievance on his way off, “‘I won the World Cup for this country.” 
High in the stands, Paddy Hill was supposed to be enjoying his first fortnight of notional freedom, recently released having spent almost 17 years in English prisons for a crime he did not commit. He was at the game with his son and Gerry Conlon, also recently released after a monstrous injustice of his own.
With the game level at 1-1 and drawing to a close, Paddy and co. left a couple of minutes early to catch a reserved taxi and were recognised by a group of England fans.
“When we came out there were a load of skinheads and they started chasing us”, he remembers today. “‘You fucking bastards, IRA animals’, etc, they were hurling abuse. It’s the one thing I will never forget about that match.”
They ran off, but as the night’s theatre at Wembley had shown, shaking off the past is a much more difficult thing.  
**********
Paddy Hill is one of the few Irish football fans to have missed the first half of the Charlton Years. If Charlton’s team broadened and nuanced what it meant to be Irish, Hill missed out as a victim of a narrow view of the same. 
He and five others - Hugh Callaghan, Gerard Hunter, Richard McIlkenny, William Power and John Walker – had the grave misfortune to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, travelling to meet the wrong people while carrying the wrong passport. 
Five of them were born in Belfast – John Walker was from Derry – and all were living in Birmingham when bombs exploded in the Mulberry Bush and Tavern in the Town pubs on 21 November, 1974. 
21 people were killed and another 182 injured in what was then the deadliest post-war attack in Britain. The IRA did not immediately claim responsibility, but this attack came amid their bombing campaign in Britain and a scarred country demanded accountability. 
That evening, the men who would become known as the Birmingham Six had a drink at New Street Station before all but Callaghan boarded a train headed for Heysham Port. They were catching a ferry back to Ireland for the funeral of James McDade, a member of the IRA who blew himself up while planting a bomb in Coventry a week earlier. 
None were members of the IRA, but those on the train knew McDade and his family from their youth, so went to pay their respects. All five carried Mass cards. 
The bombs had detonated by the time they reached the port, where they were detained and, having been subject to a forensics test, were handed over to the West Midlands Serious Crime Squad with Callaghan later arrested at his home. The five on the train did not tell police why they were going back to Ireland, which was later used against them.
All six men were innocent, but were savagely beaten and tortured by police to force a confession.

One policeman shoved a gun in Hill’s mouth, telling him that if he didn’t sign a statement, he would pull the trigger on the count of three. Hill refused, and then heard “one, two, three”…click.
Hill was struck with the gun instead, and lost some teeth.
Following similar ordeals, four of the men signed statements that implicated all six. 
“The police told us right from the beginning, and I’ll never forget their words. ‘We know you didn’t do the bombings. We don’t give a fuck who did them. We have your statement and that’s good enough for us. It keeps the public off our gaffers’ back and our gaffers off ours.’” 
They were charged with murder and conspiracy to cause explosions, and put on trial. The conviction hung on two pillars: the forensics and the false confessions.
Hill was supposedly implicated in the forensics, on the basis of a flawed “Griess test” which was later proven to fail to distinguish between nitroglycerine – used in explosives – and nitrocellulose, an innocent and everyday chemical found in soap. 
The confessions, meanwhile, were signed under extreme duress and were thus wafer-thin, but were nonetheless permitted as evidence. One of the statements, for instance, claimed the bombs were planted in white plastic bags, with later independent forensics showing the bombs were in fact held in leather bags. 
In spite of the flimsy evidence, on Friday 13 August 1975, all six were found guilty and sentenced to life in prison. 
“When we were sent down to Lancaster Prison and we came down the stairs, the governor stood there, and there were tears on his cheeks”, reflects Paddy. “He said, ‘I feel ashamed to be any part of this judicial system. What happened in that court was a disgrace.’” 
They applied for appeal, but that was dismissed in March ’76. They also launched a civil suit against the West Midlands Police over the injuries they suffered in custody, but an appeal against it by the police force was upheld by Lord Denning because of the potential implications if the Birmingham Six were found to be telling the truth.
Had it been successful, members of the police would have been found to have committed violence and perjury with the confessions involuntary and thus the conviction wrong, something Lord Denning said would be “such an appalling vista that every sensible person would say, ‘It cannot be right that these actions should go any further’.” 
And, for years, nothing did go further.
Hill continued to agitate for justice, writing thousands of letters to politicians, lawyers, and journalists seeking support.
Few responded and fewer still offered support. Hill became exasperated at the Irish government, later beseeching Charles Haughey to raise their case at the European Court of Human Rights and publicly state their innocence. Haughey said the better course of action was to pressure the British Home Secretary to reopen the case. 
Tanaiste Peter Barry was sent over to make a similar argument, again stressing the best route to justice was through diplomatic channels. A furious Hill grabbed him by the lapels and then walked out. 
“You can’t go to them cap in hand, you have to stand up to them”, reasoned Paddy.
He would later admire that pluck and obstinacy in Charlton’s football team. 
In the mean-time, he had the tiny relief of being able to follow football in prison. It was usually better on the radio: some games were shown on the communal television, but lock-up being around 9pm meant the first half of an evening game was watched live with the second half recorded and watched the following day.

Curiously, his only crisp memories of following football in prison are the sad ones. He can still vividly remember lying on the floor of his cell listening to reports of the Bradford Fire and, later, the Heysel tragedy, while years later he watched the Hillsborough disaster unfold on television, breaking down in the arms of Eric Tomlinson, the only other Liverpool fan he knew in prison. Hill later joined the Hillsborough Justice Campaign. 
There are no memories of Charlton’s Ireland as he was too busy working on his case because, happily, there were a few flinty and righteous souls willing to listen.
Fr. Dennis Faul campaigned for the release of The Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four, Civil Rights lawyer Gareth Pierce agreed to represent Hill, and journalist and soon-to-be-MP Chris Mullin publicly threw doubt on the men’s guilt, first on Granada’s World in Action TV series in which he pointed out the flaws in the forensics used to convict Hill, and then in a book, Error of Judgement. 
Meanwhile, Conservative MP Sir John Farr also pushed for action in the House of Commons. Jeremy Corbyn had voiced his support in the past, but Hill says he was too easily written off by the establishment. The words of a Conservative knight of the realm were less easy to dismiss. 
They were finally granted an appeal in 1987, which they lost. It dragged on for six weeks and gained huge media attention, however, with Amnesty International among those monitoring, who had to that point knocked back an annual letter from Hill pleading for help. 
“I knew we had cleared the last hurdle after all the publicity of the ‘87 appeal. That was the last hurdle.” 
The momentum of publicity – aided by the 1989 release of the Guildford Four – resulted in another appeal in 1991, at which the limitations of the forensic evidence and the unreliability of the confession statements were made clear.
Supposedly contemporaneous notes taken on an interview with Richard McIlkenny were shown to be written retrospectively, filled with inconsistencies.
The Birmingham Six finally walked free on 14 March 1991.

“I’m angry”, says Hill today.
“I’ll always be angry in respect of the Birmingham Serious Crime Squad. I had a hard time explaining to my mother that I don’t hate every policeman. In fact, on my journey, I met some wonderful police officers. Same with prison officers. I’ve met some no-good bastards on the way but I’ve met a hell of a lot of good ones. But I am bitter against the West Midlands Serious Crime Squad. 
“First they tell you they know you’re innocent, but then the bastards turn around and torture you for the next three days? Even now I can’t get it out of my mind. I think it about it all the fucking time.”
**********
Hill was at Wembley in 1991 thanks to his appearance on the Late Late Show a week after his release. Asked by Gay Byrne what he was looking forward to now that he had been released, Hill said the following upcoming game if only he could get his hands on a couple of tickets. 
The FAI duly rang RTE and offered him tickets. During an ad break, Hill joked that “Big Jack might sort us out”, which Byrne misheard as “the big cheque might sort us out.”
The Birmingham Six were granted compensation ranging from £800,000 to £1.2 million, but it was nowhere near enough. After almost 17 years in prison, they were released right back into the world without any kind of reintegration.
The way they released us is as big an injustice as the way they took us off the streets. They threw us out. Don’t get me wrong. If you told me the day I got out of jail that I wouldn’t be able to handle the outside world I would have laughed in your face. After what I’d been through for 16-and-a-half years? It’s like living in a killing field in prison. You never know what’s going to happen. The tension…you live on your nerves. 
“They just us spilled us onto the street and they threw some money at us. We weren’t equipped to handle money. The world had travelled so far and so fast and everything became so expensive. Before I went away I used to take my ex-wife, God rest her soul, to the pub and I’d get a pint, her a light ale and 20 cigarettes and I got 5p change out of 50p. When I came out, it was three pounds something a pint. Everything had gone so far.
“I hit the wall in 1992. I promised I would give the first year of my life campaigning, but I’m still doing it today. The second year, I hit the ground. I wanted to go back to jail. 
“I honestly wanted to go back. I was happier in prison than I was outside. I had been used to the rhythm of that for so long. I felt so lonely out here. I didn’t feel a part of anything.
“It has eased off, but you hear this great cliche that time is a great healer. Bullshit. Time doesn’t fucking heal anything. If you’re lucky, you learn to handle it a bit better each day. 
“I’ve learned to handle it. I realised years ago we weren’t going to get any help from the government.”

In 2010 Hill won the right for the NHS to provide him with counselling, and was given a month as an in-patient at London’s Nightingale Hospital. It didn’t suit him. The fact that patients weren’t allowed out after 9pm made it a pseudo incarceration that dragged him back to the past.
Hill is living in Scotland now, and applied for further counselling through his local NHS board, only to be told there was nobody qualified to treat his level of trauma. 
It’s too late for me. I have learned to manage it myself for the last 30 years. I have come to terms with it. I suffer from depression, I have level four PTSD, which is higher than a lot of soldiers. We needed counselling immediately afterwards. Once they released us: that’s when we needed it. A psychiatrist told me I was like someone in the trenches at the first world war. I’m afraid to go to sleep as I may not wake. I only sleep for two to three hours, and then I’m awake. I still have the nightmares, sometimes I wake up screaming. 
“Sometimes I end up throwing off the bed clothes and punching the wall. There will be other times when I’m watching television or listening to the radio and I’m okay, and then a few minutes later, I’m sitting crying my fucking eyes out like a child. 
“That’s still happening and I’m 75 fucking years of age. And I don’t know what I’m crying about.” 
**********
Hill didn’t put a full stop at his campaigning within a year of his release. In 2001 he founded the Miscarriages of Justice Organisation, which pledges to give a voice and support to others who have been falsely convicted of crimes. 
He also continues to offer support to the families of those killed in the Birmingham bombings, as they seek to bring those responsible for the atrocity to justice.
A 2016 request on behalf of three of the victims’ families to reopen the inquest into the bombings was granted, and in April 2019 the inquest found a botched IRA warning call led to the deaths of 21 people. Last month, British Home Secretary Priti Patel agreed to consider opening a public inquiry into the atrocity, and will meet the relatives of victims. 
The bombings remain the biggest unsolved murder in British history.
Football, meanwhile, remains a decent diversion for Hill, and he will be tuning in when Ireland return to Wembley in altogether more prosaic circumstances for a friendly international game next Thursday. 
Since his release he has struck up a friendship with Martin O’Neill, who invited him to Celtic games when he was in charge at Parkhead. Neil Lennon has kept the invitation open. 
Hill didn’t take O’Neill up on offers to go to Irish games when he was in charge, though says the FAI have always remained helpful. 
“I don’t want freebies all the time. People would put out the red carpet for me and a lot of the time it’s embarrassing. I don’t want to be made a fuss of.
“Some people look upon us as some sort of fucking heroes.
“Heroes for what?”

1032,189,"'Warmest congratulations': Leaders from Ireland and around the world welcome Biden election",https://www.thejournal.ie/world-leaders-congratulate-joe-biden-5259938-Nov2020/,"WORLD LEADERS HAVE welcomed Joe Biden’s election as US president as a chance to enhance cooperation on climate change, the coronavirus pandemic and other issues after four years of Donald Trump’s rejection of international alliances.
Trump had yet to concede defeat, but Western and Asian allies expressed hoped for a fresh start following his “America first” trade policies, withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and attacks on Nato and the World Health Organisation.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin offered his congratulations to Biden following his win.
Martin said that he wanted to offer the “warmest congratulations to Joe Biden on his election as the 46th President of the United States”.
“Ireland takes pride in Joe Biden’s election, just as we are proud of all the generations of Irish women and Irish men and their ancestors whose toil and genius have enriched the diversity that powers America,” Martin said. 
This is a particularly special day for the people of County Louth and of County Mayo who count President-elect Biden among their own.
“Joe Biden has always been a stalwart friend and supporter of Ireland, including of the prosperity, stability and opportunity made possible by the Good Friday Agreement, to which he has pledged his ongoing steadfast support.
“I also wish to congratulate Kamala Harris on her election as Vice-President and recognise the tremendous significance of her election to the role,” he said.
“I am greatly looking forward to working with the new Administration in the period ahead in progressing international peace and security.”
“I also intend to work closely with the new Administration and the United States Congress to pursue comprehensive immigration reform, an issue that is so important to tens of thousands of Irish people making a significant contribution to America.” 
President Michael D. Higgins said that “I have conveyed my best wishes to President-elect Joe Biden, wishing him and the American people every good fortune for his term in office and congratulating him, and congratulating Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on her historic achievement”.
“Sabina and I, and the staff at Áras an Uachtaráin, have the warmest memories of Joe Biden’s two visits to us,” Higgins said.
Abroad
In Asia, a region on edge about the strategic ambitions of China’s ruling Communist Party, the elected leaders of Japan, South Korea and Taiwan invoked “shared values” with Washington and expressed hope for close relations.
“I look forward to working with you to further strengthen the Japan-US Alliance and ensure peace, freedom, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond,” said Japanese prime minister Yoshihide Suga on Twitter.
President Moon Jae-in of South Korea said he looked forward to working together “for our shared values”.

There was no immediate official reaction from Beijing, which is mired in conflicts with the Trump administration over trade, security and technology.
But Chinese social media users welcomed the change. A post on the Sina Weibo microblog service, signed Gong Teng Xin Yi, said: “Congratulating Biden, the old friend of Chinese people on winning the election.”
After Trump said he won “by a lot,” the Communist Party newspaper People’s Daily responded on Twitter, “HaHa”.
President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan, the self-ruled island Beijing claims as part of its territory, expressed hope to “further our friendship”.
Biden had congratulated Tsai on her re-election in January, saying Taiwan is “stronger because of your free and open society”. Washington has no formal relations with Taiwan, but Mr Trump raised the profile of informal contacts by sending Cabinet officials to the island, an act that irritated Beijing.
There was also no immediate reaction from Russian president Vladimir Putin, who was friendly with Trump. Other leaders who supported Trump, including President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, congratulated Biden, indicating they rejected Trump’s claim the election wasn’t over.
Most Western allies welcomed a fresh start with Washington. Many have been dismayed at Trump’s criticism of decades-old military and economic alliances.
“We want to work in our cooperation for a new trans-Atlantic beginning, a New Deal,” said German foreign minister Heiko Maas on Twitter.
Others expressed hope Biden might revive co-operation on health, climate and other issues following Trump’s rejection of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and pressure on Canada, Mexico, South Korea and other partners to renegotiate trade terms.
“I look forward to working with President-elect Biden, Vice President-elect Harris, their administration, and the United States Congress as we tackle the world’s greatest challenges together,” said Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, who was the target of personal insults from Trump.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia told reporters he looked forward to a “great partnership” with Washington. He cited challenges including the coronavirus and “ensuring a free and open” Indo-Pacific region, a reference to China’s disputes with its neighbours over control of vast tracts of ocean.
“American leadership is indispensable to meeting these challenges,” Morrison said.

“Though we have political differences, I know Joe Biden to be a good man, who has won his opportunity to lead and unify our country,” Bush said.
“I want to congratulate President Trump and his supporters on a hard fought campaign. He earned the votes of more than 70 million Americans – an extraordinary political achievement. They have spoken, and their votes will continue to be heard through elected Republicans at every level of government,” he said.
Bush said that the “fact that so many of our fellow citizens participated in this election is a positive sign of the health of our democracy and a reminder to the world of its strength. No matter how you voted, your vote counted”.
“President Trump has the right to request recounts and pursue legal challenges, and any unresolved issues will be properly adjudicated.
The American people can have confidence that this election was fundamentally fair, its integrity will be upheld, and its outcome is clear.”
Prime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan said he looked forward to working together to end illegal tax havens and on peace-making in Afghanistan.
Other leaders who sent congratulations included German chancellor Angela Merkel, French president Emmanuel Macron and Egyptian president Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi.
Embattled Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro and his US-backed rival, Juan Guaido, both congratulated Biden and Harris. Maduro said Venezuela, which is under crippling US sanctions aimed at forcing him out of office, was “ready for dialogue and understanding” with the United States.
The election outcome drew mixed reviews in Iraq, where Biden is remembered as a champion of the US invasion in 2003. Still, Iraqi president Barham Salih described Biden as a friend and trusted partner.
Congratulations also poured in from leaders who got along with Trump but ignored his claims the election was not over.
The Philippines’ Duterte, who had said Filipino-Americans would “get the best deal with Trump”, expressed hope for enhanced ties based on “shared commitment to democracy, freedom and the rule of law”.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates, who was close to Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, extended his best wishes to Biden and vice president-elect Kamala Harris on Twitter.
Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, who has been known for public displays of bonhomie with Trump, shared a photo of himself with Biden and offered his congratulations “on your spectacular victory!”.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, another Trump ally, said he looked forward to “working closely together on our shared priorities, from climate change to trade and security”.

Harris’s election inspired calls in parts of Africa for more women in government.
“The time has also come to give our women the chance to occupy such a high office in our country and even the number one position,” said a Nigerian cabinet minister, Festus Keyamo, on Twitter.
Others expressed hope Biden will help to heal divisions in American society and global politics.
“He seems open to accepting people’s different viewpoints and wants to move forward in a united manner,” said Mika Goto, a nursery school employee in Tokyo.
Silence
While outspoken disappointment was scarce, several prominent leaders who have maintained warm relations with Trump’s administration kept silent.
That included President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia. Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he would wait “until all the issues are resolved”.
Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose Twitter profile photo shows him sitting beside Trump, described Biden as a friend of Israel and said he looked forward to working with him and Harris to “strength the special alliance” between their countries. In a separate statement, he thanked Trump for raising US-Israeli relations to “unprecedented heights”.
Many people, particularly in nations with turbulent politics, took Biden’s win as improving the outlook for respect of democracy.
Among them was Tanzanian opposition leader Zitto Kabwe, who was arrested and charged with terrorism-related offences after his country’s bruising presidential election.
“This victory symbolises the hope for democracy at a time when many other parts of the world are seeing that light diminishing,” KMr abwe said.
The outcome inspired disbelief in Slovenia, the homeland of first lady Melania Trump. Prime Minister Janez Jansa was the only leader who congratulated Trump even before all votes were counted and showed support after Biden’s win was announced.","Taoiseach Micheál Martin offered his congratulations to Biden following his win.",43,0,0,26971,"Nov 8th 2020, 10:05 AM"
1033,219,"The unluckiest Leinster player to never win an Ireland cap",https://www.the42.ie/chris-pim-5259703-Nov2020/,"CHRIS PIM IS surrounded by his past, pictures frozen in time, medals showing their rust, a wage slip that sums up the chaos of rugby’s first years of professionalism. Time fuzzes the memory, so Pim isn’t 100 per cent sure which month the invoice refers to.
In any case, the devil is in the detail. He was due to be paid £50 (Irish punts) a game by Old Wesley before a club official crossed that figure out, doubling his wages with a stroke of his red pen. Better still Pim’s win bonus was topped up by an extra £50. These were the early years of the Celtic Tiger, after all.
Pim's first payslip as a pro.
Rugby had gone pro but a stench of amateurism lingered in the air. As Leinster captain during their inaugural Heineken Cup season, Pim received the princely sum of £2,091 rising to an astronomical £2,847 a year later.
The wage of Leinster's first captain in the pro era.
Nonetheless Dublin throbbed with possibility in those years. A wet Wednesday in Milan was where it all kicked off; Niall Woods scoring a late try to record Leinster’s first ever Heineken Cup win. “Most of us just saw it as an adventure and a bit of craic,” Pim says. “To be honest, the first thing that came into my head was that this was just another rugby idea that wouldn’t last.”
Well he was wrong about that. The maiden voyage saw Leinster fly out of Dublin on a Tuesday afternoon, Pim gathering the pack together in the departure lounge just after check-in. “Right lads,” he said, “we are professional now, we have to take this seriously. We need to find out what the backs moves are.”
He got short shrift from his audience. “Pimmy, the backs don’t even know what their bloody moves are. Just calm down and go and buy me a coffee. We’re due to board soon.”
Things were slow to take flight. For the second game of that campaign, word reached the Leinster camp that opponents, Pontypridd, were on a £2,000-a-man bonus to reach the semis. After murmurings of discontent, each Leinster player discovered a £300 voucher for ‘gear allowance’ nestling in their kit bags.
The appeal of buying more boots and socks must have had a motivating impact because before you knew it they were in a European semi-final, Cardiff blocking their path, Lansdowne Road booked for the expected bumper crowd. Seven thousand, three hundred and fifty people showed up. “Well, that was big back then.”
It was a different era but the rugby Leinster played was sporadically glorious and gung-ho, the toughness of Pim, Dean Oswald and Victor Costello in the back row reinforced by the world class abilities of Neil Francis at second row. “When Franno was interested, and at the races, he was class, absolute class,”Pim says. “His head wasn’t always in the game but when he was on, he was on. An amazing athlete, I’ve a huge amount of time for him. I’d have picked him on my team every week.”
Victor Costello goes on the charge against Cardiff.

Jim Glennon, the then Leinster coach, thought the same way. He had Franno and a young Malcolm O’Kelly at lock; Shane Byrne and Paul Wallace – two future British and Irish Lions – in the front row; Woods and Conor O’Shea in his back three.
Except in the week of their semi-final, problems arose. The Irish international team were due to fly out to the United States and pressure was put on Glennon to omit the prospective Ireland tourists from his side. He wasn’t long telling them where to get off.
Against this backdrop, there were even more debates about money. “It was bloody awful, all this stuff going on in the background,” Pim says. “I remember some player saying, ‘let’s strike’. I looked at him and said, ‘are you having a laugh? This is a chance in a lifetime. We might never get to another European semi-final again’.”
If he’d a pain in the head from all the arguments, he’d a pain in his back from an unsupervised stint in the gym. “I was working as a sales rep at the time – so, thinking I was clever, I decided, ‘okay, European semi-final week, I’ll take the week off work’.”
Great idea until his back went into spasm after a weights session. “I am not exaggerating but I got 15 injections in my back that week. I went out onto the pitch, could not feel any pain but couldn’t move. They scored a try down the blindside – my fault. We lost the game on the back of that.”
Regret is unavoidable, but context is needed. He was too modest to mention the fact he also scored a try that day, self-deprecatingly suggesting the only reason he became provincial captain was because the international scene had passed him by.
“Look Jim (Glennon) plucked me from obscurity, possibly because he felt I was not going to be distracted by doing the Ireland thing. You see back then Ireland was the priority, Leinster the vehicle to get you there.
“I tried to make Leinster an entity in our own right so that people would be proud to play for us. Jim was fantastic; he kind of drove that. And it was great; I loved it. Franno came back in from the cold, he’d been having rows with Leinster. But he came and played for me, for want of a better expression.”
There were great days, a pushover try against Munster at the Shannon clubhouse end of Thomond Park, being the pick of them. “People used to say Leinster’s pack were soft,” Shane Byrne once said. “Try telling Dean Oswald or Chris Pim they’re soft.” “The hardest man I ever played with,” was Nick Popplewell’s glowing reference of Pim, his former schoolmate.
Source: Tom Honan/INPHO
Like Popplewell, Pim’s rugby journey started out in Newtown School, Waterford but his education intensified when he joined an Old Wesley side that was old school in every sense of the word. “First night at training, I drove all the way up from Portlaoise (his home). We ran four laps of the pitch and that was it; training over.
“And I went apeshit, shouting ‘I just drove 52 miles for that’. Phil Orr, a British and Irish Lion, was one of a posse of players staring in disbelief at this young upstart. “They threw my clothes out of the changing room,” Pim laughs.

He had to learn fast. University brought him to Scotland, where he signed for Edinburgh Accies, his time there coinciding with a golden era in Scottish back-row play, his weekends spent going up against the Calders and John Jeffrey. “As a rugby nut, growing up watching Rugby Special, it was like stepping out of a comic book; a dream becoming reality.”
Back then, players could flip between serious athletes and absolute messers in the blink of an eye. “Edinburgh Accies were the posh boys going down the country and these country lads from Kelso, Hawick, Selkirk, were intent on teaching us a lesson; I got that with Old Wesley as well and to a certain degree with Leinster. And I absolutely loved it. I’m a country boy myself. The more stick I got, the better I played. I certainly didn’t mind being told I was soft. Bring it on. Tell me I’m soft after 80 minutes.”
The gendarmes in Paris tested him for longer than that, telling him he was going to a cell for the night in February 1985. By this stage he was with the Scottish University side, dressed in a kilt, holding his Irish passport in one hand and an ornamental till in the other.
“Well you see, our match (against the French university XV) had been postponed because of a frozen pitch, so we ended up in the bar a little earlier than expected. To cut a long story short, it was a great night, a lovely pub, and someone thought we should get a souvenir from the place.
Pim delivers a pass for the Barbarians against East Midlands in 1996.

“We noticed this fantastic looking till on a shelf in the corner. ‘Wouldn’t that look cool on the bus?’ we said.” Well, the answer is obviously no – but as George W Bush memorably said, ‘when I was young and irresponsible, I was young and irresponsible’. The entire team organised the operation, look-outs posted on each door of the pub.
“And Muggins here was the designated carrier of the till. I got 50 yards down the road, said to myself, ‘this is far too heavy’ so I started walking back to the pub, the barman escorting me for the final yards of the journey. “All was good humoured,” says Pim. Unfortunately, the local bobbies thought otherwise. “They bucked me into the back of the van and the next thing I knew I was in a cell, all on my own, not a slightest clue what to do. These were pre-mobile phone days. No one spoke English. They just looked at me in bafflement, an Irish passport holder wearing a kilt. They kept me there for a good few hours, then – and this shows you how long ago this was, at 2pm the next afternoon, on the station’s black and white TV, the Scotland-France match appeared on the telly. That’s when they threw me out because they knew then I wouldn’t get to the game. That was my punishment.”
Significantly, missing out on internationals would become an enduring problem.

Chris Pim was heading home. He had his degree from Edinburgh University when he arrived at his parents house in Portlaoise, his mother waiting at the door. She had a white envelope in her hand, IRFU written in bold across the top. It was 1988. “You are invited for a trial at Lansdowne Road,” Pim read. “Your kit will be provided. Bring your boots.”
Four different times he received that type of letter, mainly to be a possible lining out against the probable XV but on one occasion he was asked to tog out in the other dressing room. They even took his suit measurements, assuming he’d be capped. “Eric Elwood missed six kicks at goal that day; Ken O’Connell came on as a replacement for the possibles and scored a try from an overthrow at the line-out.
“F**k, I said to myself. I could see it drifting away from me.” My wife Louise had gone shopping. Noel Murphy (the then Irish team manager) telling her, ‘go off and choose a nice dress there girl for the post-match dinner’.”
Louise went to Grafton Street but it was O’Connell who went to Paris, Pim the only one of the probables not to get picked. “Obviously it was my goal; all the hardship, everything was geared towards playing for Ireland. But as I look back now, and I know this might sound really twee, but I am probably a better person for not having won that cap.”
He was a tough fellah, a fitness fanatic but also a student of the sport, who’d a thirst for knowledge. He wanted to see how he could improve so he arranged a sit down with Gerry Murphy, the then Ireland coach. “This is not slagging anybody – I don’t want to slag anybody – but on two different occasions I arranged to meet Gerry for a cup of coffee in Bewleys on Westmoreland Street and twice he didn’t show up.
“Whereas now, it’s a knock on the door of the coach’s office and you walk in. But back then, the coaches weren’t available for you to have a conversation. It was different times for sure.”
Yet he loved it.
Across an hour’s conversation, Pim uses the following words and phrases to describe his time in rugby: fun, fantastic, hilarious, memories that’ll last a lifetime. Regret isn’t ever mentioned, not in terms of missing out on a cap, not in terms of missing out on a golden handshake.
He played in an era before rugby was chic, got to play for Hawke’s Bay in New Zealand, coming up against a young winger at Manawatu called Joe Schmidt in one game; 13 All Blacks who lined out for Auckland in another. “I went f**king psycho for 80 minutes, running around knocking guys over; I loved it.”
There was interprovincial success as Leinster captain; a runners-up medal in the All-Ireland league with Wesley; an invitation to play for the Barbarians. “I got to see the world through rugby; now I’d hate to spend my 20s stuck in Donnybrook. I wouldn’t change a thing.”  
Not even one thing?
“Honestly, no,” he says, pointing to the pictures on the wall behind him, a photo of him gliding past Martin Johnson, a framed autographed shirt from his day as a Barbarian. Cap or no cap, his career was a celebration ………. not a commiseration.","It is 25 years since rugby turned professional – the same year a new tournament called the Heineken Cup was born.

Seven times an All-Ireland winner as a player, the Fingal Ravens defender was listed as one of Dessie Farrell’s selectors in the match programme of last night’s Leinster SFC quarter-final against Westmeath.
Dublin have lost plenty of experience following the recent departures of Diarmuid Connolly, Jack McCaffrey, Eoghan O’Gara, Bernard Brogan and Daly.
Farrell was evidently keen to keep Daly on board in some capacity. His know-how has been retained in the dressing room as Dublin look to defend their provincial and All-Ireland titles in this most unusual of championships. 
The Sky Blues will need to win five games in the next six weeks if they’re to land the Sam Maguire on 19 December.
They overcame the first obstacle last night with minimal fuss.
“We’re happy with our performance,” said Farrell. “I thought Westmeath kicked some fantastic scores. We knew beforehand they had a bit of firepower and were capable of doing a bit of damage if we weren’t on the money but thankfully we were well focused and our heads were in the game and we got the result.
“Defensively, I think they were very well-organised. I think we did reasonably well to pick them apart for some of our scores. Goal opportunities weren’t going to be too plentiful with the way they set up and how well structured they were.
“We probably should have got one near the end and maybe should have been a little more clinical. We’re always looking for goals.”

It set-up a Leinster semi-final showdown with either Laois or Longford in Croke Park next weekend.
And the games will keep coming thick and fast with the provincial decider fixed for the same venue the following weekend. Following that, the Leinster champions will have two weeks to prepare for the All-Ireland semi-final against Ulster opposition and another fortnight before the final if they make it.
Rather than the usual two or three-week break in between championship fixtures, the week-on-week grind will bring new challenges for the Dublin squad and backroom team. 
The tight turnaround between games means using the usual in-house matches as opportunities for players to play their way into contention won’t be an option this season.
Among the big guns to remain rooted to the bench against Westmeath were Kevin McManamon, Paul Mannion, Cian O’Sullivan and Philly McMahon, while Michael Darragh Macauley didn’t make the squad as he nears a return from injury.
Farrell must walk a tightrope in keeping the team fresh, managing fatigue and injuries while dishing out enough game-time to maintain the match fitness of his veterans.
They’ll breeze through Leinster, but the Dublin boss will need all the experience at his disposal for a potential last four clash against the Ulster champions – most likely Donegal – on 5 December.

“You’re not going to get much time to practice,” he stated after the 0-22 to 0-11 win.
“It’s about recovery and obviously we’ll review the performance take a look at who we’re going to play the next day and that will be it and we’ll be ready to go again.
“It’s a big challenge and we spoke about this earlier. That’s definitely weighed heavily on some individuals’ minds and obviously not just with our squad; it’s the same for everybody. It’s a challenge to try and break-in. All you can do is what you can do.”
Westmeath boss Jack Cooney observed that not much has changed for Dublin under their new manager. 
“Certainly the hunger is still there, the organisation, athleticism and the ability, obviously that’s not in question. I think they’re a very formidable team.
“It’s difficult for them because they have a run of games now every week so if they want to win the championship, the All-Ireland, they have to go the whole way to the 19 December.
“So it’s about managing fatigure, managing injuries, load and all that so there’s an awful lot of things to take into consideration. I think that Dublin team need to be ready at the right time. They won’t be far off it .” 
After the Lake County sealed survival in Division 2, Cooney faced the tricky scenario of preparing his team for a championship that, realistically, was always going to end at the first hurdle last night.
“When the fixture was scheduled initially, we really set ourselves up as win, lose or draw this game, it was about the next game. It was about showing a bit of character to respond from possibly a defeat like this you could say, but we were denied that opportunity.
Westmeath boss Jack Cooney.

“So when we came back in September, our main focus was on the first league match. So we literally only prepared two weeks for this Dublin match because we wanted to maintain Division 2 status at least and that’s a good platform for us to develop and progress from.
“Because you don’t make up the big gap on the likes of Dublin and these overnight, a couple of weeks or one season. I think it has to be a real long-term plan. So that’s the way we went about it. 
“We were delighted we held our Division 2 status and we can develop from there. We set ourselves different targets, different performance indicators for today.
“We actually did very well on some of them which is good, the likes of turnovers – I’d say we turned over Dublin more than a lot of teams, I know conditions and time of year and all that.
“We wanted to try and put a couple of goals past them, I think we created a couple near the end when it opened up and I don’t think we gave them a real clear cut (goal chances). They never really opened us up.
“Now I know you can say that’s lacking a lot of ambition to go on and win a game but we thought they were very, very realistic achievable goals to go after in a game like this.”

A garda spokesman confirmed late last night that the eight garda members were suspended earlier yesterday, as a result of an ongoing investigation, which is being led by an Assistant Commissioner, Special Crime Operations (SCO).
The suspensions come after lengthy enquiries by a team of officers attached to the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.
The probe is focused on claims that gardaí did not pursue Garda enquiries into alleged road traffic offences and public order allegations against a number of parties.
“Further to an ongoing investigation led by the Assistant Commissioner, Special Crime Operations (SCO), involving personnel attached to the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (GNBCI), eight members of An Garda Síochána have been suspended,” a Garda spokesman said.
“This element of the investigation is focused on corruption in public office.“
“As this is an ongoing investigation, An Garda Síochána will not be commenting on the rank or the location of the members of An Garda Síochána who have been suspended,” the spokesman added.
Last October, mobile phones and documents were seized from a number of gardaí, as well as GAA players and officials.

1038,269,"Opinion: Stink bugs, hairy mollies and hedge mustard - local nature in a pandemic",https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/irish-nature-year-book-5255063-Nov2020/,"AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST Jane Powers explores the significance of nature during the Covid-19 pandemic. An Irish Nature Year is an illustrated day book filled with plants, animals, birds and creepy-crawlies from all over Ireland. Although our worlds have gotten smaller, she says you don’t have to go too far to explore and admire the natural world that exists right under your nose.
MY PHONE PINGS and a WhatsApp pops up from a friend: “What are these guys?” There’s a photo of two distinctive, chunky insects. Their name describes them perfectly: they are green shieldbugs, with well-formed, ornate bodies, like minuscule heraldic shields.
They make good specimens for studying with kids, as they move slowly and are sturdy enough to cope with small, prodding fingers. Also (fun fact!) some shieldbugs send out a foul pong when they are upset, which gives them the nickname of stink bug.
A while later, another message comes in. Another friend: “Found this hairy yoke on the path when we were out for our walk in the park.” The size of a finger and covered in orange and brown fur, it is a fox moth caterpillar.
These moth larvae come out on warm autumn and winter days to sun themselves and feed on brambles and other plants. They are one of several caterpillars known as “hairy mollies” in Ireland, a group that has lots of folklore attached to it: “When the hairy molly crosses the road, rain is near” was a Tipperary saying.
In other counties, the unfortunate creatures were caught and used as cures for the whooping cough. In Co Mayo, for example, the advice was: “tie the little animal in a red cloth and put it around the person’s neck who is bad with the cough.”
Since our first lockdown in spring, my phone has been dinging and pinging with more than the usual “What’s this?” messages with pics of birds, creepy-crawlies and plants, all wanting names.
For me, the ubiquity of nature is a silver lining to this pandemical cloud of illness, hardship and claustrophobic constraints. Nature persists in all its strange and beautiful glory even though our lives may be restricted and our movements hampered.
Nature finds a niche
You don’t have to get out into the country or move beyond your 5km zone to find heaps of different flora and fauna species. Nature finds a niche in even the most inhospitable parts of our landscape.
The cracks in the paving are inhabited by colonies of plants perfectly suited to the situation: wall barley, hedge mustard, groundsel and sow thistle, to mention a few. Look up and you’ll see buddleja growing out of chimney pots.
Also known as the butterfly bush, the purple-flowered shrub was introduced from China in Victorian times, but it soon jumped from the garden to our built landscape.
Find a patch of ivy and you’ll see that it is buzzing with life. Its curious flowers, which bloom in autumn and winter, are one of the best nectar sources and are visited by bees, wasps and flies.
Ivy’s shiny, waterproof leaves offer shelter to innumerable creatures. Sparrows, dunnocks, robins and wrens roost overnight in it, brimstone and holly blue butterflies and queen wasps hibernate in it. The caterpillar of the swallow-tailed moth is another inhabitant, but it is impossible to spot, as it takes on the shape of a dead twig.
This last feat, that of mimicry, is a trick that nature is particularly good at: it gives us hoverflies that look like bees or wasps, caterpillars that resemble twigs or bird droppings (yes!), and butterflies with “eyes” on their wings that scare off potential predators.
The magic of aphids
One of my favourite and most devious bits of trickery involves certain aphids. Aphids, or greenflies as they are commonly known, are often “farmed” by ants for the waste plant sap that they exude.
#OPEN JOURNALISM No news is bad news Support The Journal Your contributions will help us continue to deliver the stories that are important to you

The liquid, which is known as honeydew, is sweet and full of energy. So, colonies of aphids — like herds of insect dairy cows — are often protected by ants, who even carry them to newer pastures or into their nests.
Some aphids, however, turn the tables on their shepherds in a really nasty way. They are able to imitate the creamy blobbiness of ant eggs, fooling the ants into carefully minding them and placing them among their own larvae. When the coast is clear, the aphids pierce the skin of the ant grubs and suck out their vital fluids.
This, my friends, is the kind of spectacularly clever thing that is going on every day right under our noses. The unexpectedness of the natural world is one of the reasons that I wrote my book, An Irish Nature Year.

US PRESIDENT-ELECT Joe Biden has promised to unite Americans and to heal divisions after what he called a clear and “convincing” victory over Donald Trump.
The Democrat is projected to win the presidency and become the 46th US president after widening his lead in Pennsylvania at around 4pm Irish time yesterday.
In a speech at his campaign base in Wilmington, Delaware, the 77-year-old pledged to start work immediately and said his administration would bring a the country together.
“This is the time to heal in America,” he told supporters at an outdoor rally shortly after 1am Irish time.
“I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide, but unify, who doesn’t see red states and blue states, but only sees the United States, and work with all my heart with the confidence of the whole people, to win the confidence of all of you.
“For that is what America I believe is about. It’s about people. And that’s what our administration will be all about.”
Biden also acknowledged the disappointment of Trump supporters, but reached out to those who voted for his Republican rival.
“They are not our enemies. They are Americans,” he said.
“Let’s give each other a chance. It’s time to put away the harsh rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again, listen to each other again.”
He added: “Let this era of demonisation in America begin to end here. I sought this office to restore the soul of America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class, and to make America respected around the world again.”
Biden was upbeat as he addressed the socially distanced crowd, racing to the podium after an introduction by vice president-elect Kamala Harris to the sounds of Bruce Springsteen’s ‘We Take Care of Our Own’.
“Folks, the people of this nation have spoken. They’ve delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory,” Biden said.
The president-elect said his work would start with getting the Covid-19 outbreak in the US under control, and pledged to name a group of leading scientists as “transition advisers” on Monday.
“I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic,” he said.
Biden also said his administration must “restore the soul of America” and make the country set an example for the rest of the world.
“We will lead not only by the example of our power, but by the power of our example,” he promised.
The former vice president paid particular tribute to the African-American community, pointing to its role in selecting him as the Democratic nominee to challenge Trump.
And he heaped praise on his running mate Kamala Harris, whose election as the second person of colour and first woman to vice president he said has been “long overdue”.

‘America’s democracy is not guaranteed’
In her speech before Biden’s appearance, Harris began by quoting the late Georgia Senator and civil rights leader John Lewis, saying that “democracy is not a state; it is an act”.
“America’s democracy is not guaranteed. It is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it, to guard it and never take it for granted,” she said.
“And protecting our democracy takes struggle, takes sacrifice. But there is joy in it, and there is progress, because we the people have the power to build a better future.”
Harris said that the “very soul of America” was at stake during the election, and thanked the Biden campaign’s staff for bringing so many people out to vote.
She paid tribute to her own mother, who moved to the US from India at the age of 19.
“She believed so deeply in an America, where a moment like this is possible. I am thinking about her, and about the generations of women – black women, Asian, white, Latina, Native American women – who throughout our nation’s history have paved away for this moment tonight,” the vice president-elect said.
Harris also praised American women in general, from those who fought for their right to vote over a century ago those to those who voted in this year’s election. And she thanked Biden for helping to make her the first woman to become US Vice President, pledging to be a trailblazer for others.
“While I will be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last,” she said.

1040,213,"The Fed, the Senate and stimulus: How might the election shape American responses to the economic crisis?",https://www.thejournal.ie/us-election-federal-reserve-5258033-Nov2020/,"THERE IS A tired old saying that when America sneezes, the world catches a cold.
As clichés go, it might seem a bit on the nose in the middle of a pandemic.
Unfortunately, it also happens to be a truism, given the importance of the United States to the global economy.
That’s why investors, central bankers and economists all over the world will have been watching this week’s US general election with keen interest against the backdrop of a global economic crisis.
As if there wasn’t enough news coming out of the States this week, the Federal Reserve — the country’s central bank — on Thursday held a regularly scheduled meeting of its Open Markets Committee (OMC); the bank’s main monetary policy decision-making body.
When it meets and announces its findings, policymakers from every corner of the planet tend to sit up and take notice.
Ultimately, the Fed decided this week to keep monetary policy unchanged for the time being.
There were, however, a couple of interesting comments in a post-meeting press conference from Jay Powell, the chairman of the central bank.
Although he was quick to steer the discussion away from the election, Powell sounded warning for US lawmakers. “Fiscal policy can do what we can’t, which is to replace lost incomes for people who are out of work through no fault of their own,” Powell said, calling government spending measures “absolutely essential”.
(For anyone who needs a quick refresher on Leaving Cert economics, monetary policy, broadly relates to the efforts of central banks to achieve policy objectives through control the money supply, interest rates etc. Fiscal policy relates to government spending, borrowing and taxation).
Indeed, Powell has been increasingly vocal in his calls for Washington to spend more to help support the recovery with most of the money from the massive stimulus measures passed in March about to dry up.
Run-off election
Despite months of negotiations, the White House failed to reach an agreement with congressional Democrats on a new stimulus package before Tuesday’s presidential election.
Roughly speaking, the Democrats want a $2 trillion package while Republicans would only settle for $1 trillion, having passed the $3 trillion pandemic-related HEROES Act in May.
Results this week could complicate matters further.
It looks likely that the Democrats have held onto control of Congress, albeit with a slimmer majority.
In the Senate, they needed to pick up three seats to secure a 50-50 split, which looked unlikely early on in the week.
That split would allow Vice President-elect Kamala Harris to act as tie-breaker in any Senate vote on the stimulus or other measures until, at least, the 2022 mid-term elections.
As of today, it looks like the Democrats look to have picked up one of the three needed.
However, in two Senate races in Georgia, no candidate won enough votes to surpass the percentage required by the state’s laws to be declared the winner.
That means two races are heading for a run-off election on 5 January in which Republican and Democratic Candidates will compete in a straight head-to-head contest to determine a winner.
For President-elect Biden and hopes of fresh stimulus, a lot will hang on those two races.
If Georgia goes his way, it’s expected Biden will push for measures with a final price-tag closer to $3 trillion.
Preliminary agreements have already been reached in Congress on some of the terms of the new stimulus measures, which include $1,200 direct transfer payments to families.
On top of that, Biden wants to hand out “additional stimulus” cheques to families and monthly social security checks by $200 per month. But without the Senate, it’s likely his plans will be significantly watered down by Republicans.
There’s also the possibility that the GOP could look to rush through stimulus over the next three months while Trump is still in office.
Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicated on Wednesday he wants to quickly approve new legislation in the “lame duck” session, marking the final weeks of the current Congress.
But in the past, he has favoured only limited programmes and he seems increasingly swayed by the arguments of the ‘fiscal hawks’ in his party.
Whether Trump would sign off on a deal during that period, is another story altogether.
His economic adviser Stephen Moore told the Washington Post on Thursday that “Trump does not want the last thing he does in office [to be] a $2 trillion debt spending bill. We want Biden to own that, not Trump”.
Rock bottom
On the economic policy front, what’s going on in the US should actually be familiar to us here in the eurozone.
“It’s become very clear that monetary policy alone is at the end of what it can do,” on both sides of the Atlantic, says Conor O’Toole, Senior Research Officer at the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) in Dublin.
“It just cannot do any more. It’s been incredibly accommodative. It is providing all the funding it can through both standard and non-standard measures. But what has to happen now is that the government steps in with fiscal responses.”
But why exactly?
Like the European Central Bank (ECB), the Fed has slashed interest rates, which are currently at or very near rock bottom.
With no room to manoeuvre on interest rates, the Fed like the ECB, has to rely on ‘non-standard’ policy mechanisms to keep money flowing into financial markets and effectively prop up the economy.
Like the ECB — which has been literally printing money and using it to buy up lots of the extra debt issued by eurozone governments since March — the Fed is snapping up about $80 billion worth of US government ‘treasuries’ (bonds) every month in a bid to keep borrowing costs low for the American government.
Again, like the ECB, the Fed has also been purchasing not just public but corporate debt on a huge scale, a policy which has helped keep stock markets buoyant since the start of the crisis.
‘Quantitative easing’ of this kind also keeps money pouring into financial institutions, keeping them in ‘liquidity’ so they can continue to lend to businesses and individuals.
That’s all well and good, says O’Toole but monetary policy has its limits — and both the Fed and the ECB have stretched it about as far as it can go.
While monetary policy can lead the horse to water, so to speak, — lowering borrowing costs for governments so it can raise debt and spend it on stimulating the economy — it can’t make it drink.
That’s where fiscal policy comes in, says O’Toole. “That’s where the government spending needs to take place and that’s what they can’t agree on in the States.

“But they’re going to have to because it’s badly needed,” he says.
Mirror image
Faced with the same issues, Powell’s opposite number in the ECB, Christine Lagarde, has been humming a similar tune since the start of the pandemic.
Lagarde is practically blue in the face from telling European policymakers to get a massive fiscal spending package on-stream as soon as possible.
That package — the €750 billion EU recovery fund agreed upon, in principle, by EU leaders in July — is still winding its way through the bloc’s decision-making process, delayed, in typical fashion, by a disagreement between political leaders about how it will work.
In lieu of that, individual member states have launched massive fiscal spending initiatives to boost their respective economies.
“Ireland’s a clear example of that,” says O’Toole with the government having announced its “biggest ever budget, a massive amount of spending and a huge government deficit probably in the mid €20 billions”.
“But it’s the right thing to do,” he says.
“To be perfectly honest in the short term, governments need to borrow whatever they need to undertake spending both on the healthcare side, and also to support households and firms.”
So monetary policy can create the conditions for that sort of government action, but it can’t put money into the hands of citizens or businesses.
But what can the Fed do if it’s already stretched to its limits?
It could do what the ECB is likely to do in December — increase the overall firepower of its purchasing programme.
But above all else, says O’Toole, Fed policymakers have to “make sure that they don’t walk back prematurely” on the aggressive emergency actions undertaken in recent months.
“They have to continue to provide whatever liquidity assistance is needed, so that the American economy can come through the public health phase of this particular crisis.”
Interest rates aren’t even that important right now, he believes.
He explains, “The most important thing is the unconventional measures… providing the appropriate level of firepower to the fiscal authorities to undertake spending.
“To me, like, it’s a mirror image of what we need the ECB to do in Europe. We need the ECB to give the individual member states the capacity to do the fiscal spending right. That is its most important job over the next 12 months.
“It’s the same in the States.”

Garfield was a skilled metal worker and was the only person Bell would use to make his prototypes. This relationship continued while Garfield was in office.
After Garfield was shot, Bell used a metal detector to try to find where the bullet was lodged.

Bell and Garfield were in university together. Bell, too busy crafting inventions to attend lectures, relied on Garfield's notes to pass his exams.
Garfield was the first person Bell called after inventing the telephone, however Garfield did not answer (because he didn't have a telephone, obviously).

The Democrat became president-elect this afternoon after securing the state of Pennsylvania, giving him the required 270 electoral college votes.
Ballina has been decked out in the famous stars and stripes in anticipation of his success.
Ballina local Joe Blewitt, a cousin of Biden, praised the president-elect’s approach compared with that of Donald Trump. 
“Joe Biden is talking about policies, he’s meeting with all the health officials and he’s setting up a plan,” Blewitt said. 
“The other man is still talking about himself. That was always the case with him. It wasn’t about the people, it was about himself.”
Blewitt, a heating and plumbing contractor, was invited to the White House in 2017, when Biden was awarded the congressional medal of freedom from then-president Barack Obama.
He is hoping he will be able to make it over again for the inauguration.
He said: “Hopefully we can go back over in January.”
The pair are in regular contact too, with Blewitt remarking: “They’re sound, they’re good people and he’s a really nice fella. He’s good to talk to.”
The festival atmosphere in Ballina on Saturday was a mark of how much Biden’s victory means to the town.

“He was here when he was vice president and the hype when he was here the last time was unbelievable. They’re so proud of him.
“Now he’ll be the President of the United States, they’re delighted, they’re absolutely delighted. To think one of their own is one of the most powerful men in the world,” Blewitt said.
Businesses all over the town, many of them closed due to lockdown restrictions, were all decked out in posters and American flags, while locals sipped champagne in celebration.
It was especially sweet for Beryl McCrainey Slevin, a California native who has lived in Ballina for over 15 years.
Her hope is that Biden will be able to reunite her homeland after a divisive four years under Trump.

She said: “I’m really, really hopeful. I’m hoping that after this election we can really work on building alliances with everyone in the country.
“We are all American and the ideals of America are so important globally, that I think it’s really important that we come together once again as a nation and continue the work of building the American dream for everyone.”
She added: “For me personally, it will bring back dignity to the White House. Hopefully it will bring about the necessary changes in terms of systemic racial problems that we’re having and have had historically in America.
“I also feel very strongly that Joe Biden is in a place now that he’s ready to do serious justice reform, police reform nationally.”
She met with Biden when he visited Ballina while serving as vice president and is looking forward to his return.

“The town just went bananas. It was just so exciting to have him here. Everybody was out, the children were out, schoolkids were out to greet the plane over at Knock.
“Really for all of Co Mayo it was amazing, but in particular for Ballina. You feel like he’s one of us, he’s one of our own” she said.
She added: “They were just warm, wonderful people. I’m excited for the town and the future of the town.
“I’m excited for America, even though I live here. It’s the country of my birth, and you always want the best for home. Absolutely, a double win.”
Meanwhile, Joe Blewitt is not ruling out the possibility of a Joe Biden plaza in Ballina – similar to the one built in Moneygall to honour Barack Obama when he visited his ancestral home.
“Yeah, we’ve got messages coming in now, where are we going to put it? It’s great craic” he said.
Biden’s great-great-great-grandfather Edward Blewit emigrated from the town almost 200 years ago, having worked as a brick-maker and as a civil engineer helping to map Ireland.
Ten of his 16 great-great grandparents were also born in Ireland.
A mural of Biden, which overlooks the main square in the old market town, was recently created by local artists Smiler Mitchell and Leslie Lackey.
After the unveiling, Biden pledged to revisit the town if he wins the election.","“He’s a really nice fella. He’s good to talk to.”",121,0,0,39913,"Nov 7th 2020, 7:11 PM"

Coupled with his victory in Nevada, that win put Biden at 290 to Trump’s 214, with the challenger expected to pick up more from Georgia where votes are being tallied.
In a statement, the former vice president said he was “honoured and humbled by the trust the American people have placed” in him and his Vice President-elect, Kamala Harris.
“In the face of unprecedented obstacles, a record number of Americans voted. Proving once again, that democracy beats deep in the heart of America,” he said.
“With the campaign over, it’s time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation. It’s time for America to unite. And to heal.
“We are the United States of America. And there’s nothing we can’t do, if we do it together.”
By contrast, President Trump, who has made a number of baseless, unsubstantiated allegations about mass voter fraud since Tuesday’s election, remaining bullish, repeated a number of his most serious claims.
In a statement issued while the President was golfing at his club in Virginia, he accused his challenger of trying to “falsely pose” as the winner with the assistance of the media.
“The simple fact is this election is far from over. Joe Biden has not been certified as the winner of any states, let alone any of the highly contested states headed for mandatory recounts, or states where our campaign has valid and legitimate legal challenges that could determine the ultimate victor,” Trump said.

Trump said that “beginning Monday,” his campaign will “will start prosecuting our case in court to ensure election laws are fully upheld and the rightful winner is seated”.
He alleged that the Biden campaign “wants ballots counted even if they are fraudulent, manufactured, or cast by ineligible or deceased voters.”
No evidence has been presented to support these allegations.

Biden will be the 46th president of the US after securing the state of Pennsylvania and its 20 electoral votes, pushing him past the 270 needed to win the presidency.
Irish leaders have offered their support and well wishes to Biden after the announcement of his projected win.
President Michael D. Higgins said that “today, I have conveyed my best wishes to President-elect Joe Biden, wishing him and the American people every good fortune for his term in office and congratulating him, and congratulating Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on her historic achievement”.
“Sabina and I, and the staff at Áras an Uachtaráin, have the warmest memories of Joe Biden’s two visits to us,” Higgins said.
“The bonds between the peoples of Ireland and the United States are close and strong, and I look forward to our two countries working together to rebuild the much-needed trust in the methods and institutions of national and international solidarity and cooperation,” he said.
That solidarity is indispensable, if we are to address the urgent challenges of our time, including such diverse issues as the need to address the cause and consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change, global poverty, hunger, migration and the digitisation of our economies, all issues on which the President-elect has expressed a commitment.”
“On behalf of the people of Ireland, I wish President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris every success in the years ahead,” Higgins said.

“I know many Irish people will be breathing a sigh of relief at Joe Biden’s victory. The last four years have been hard to watch as American democracy declined. The racist appeasement, sexist rhetoric and attacks on the free press from President Trump have all been deeply disturbing,” O’Callaghan said.

“The election of Joe Biden signals a much-needed change in direction. Kamala Harris is set to smash a number of glass ceilings by becoming the first female Vice President, as well as the first Black and South Asian-American Vice President. This is a moment of significant progress to be celebrated,” he said.
Joe Biden’s win in the presidential election was solidified in the last hour after he won the state of Pennsylvania.
After the result of a batch of 3,000 votes were announced this afternoon in Pennsylvania, Biden increased his lead to 49.6% in the state over 49.1% for Trump.
Pennsylvania’s 20 electoral college votes put Biden at 284 to Trump’s 214. The benchmark for a win is 270.

1050,186,"What exactly does US President-elect Joe Biden plan to do?",https://www.thejournal.ie/what-does-joe-biden-plan-to-do-5258115-Nov2020/,"BIDEN’S MAIN MESSAGE along the campaign trail was majorly focused on getting the coronavirus pandemic under control in the US and healing the country’s deep divisions. 
But before the pandemic hit, he had laid out more substantial plans like addressing health care disparities, toughening gun control, overhauling policing, providing free community college, erasing student loan debt, investing in green energy and improving the nation’s infrastructure.
The US president-elect also rolled out plans that include a $700 billion investment in research and development in US tech firms and purchasing American goods, $2 trillion on a green energy ‘jobs and infrastructure’ plan and $775 billion in spending on care for children, older people and those with disabilities. 
From battling the coronavirus to rejoining the Paris climate agreement and immigration reform, the Biden presidency, he says, will change course on multiple fronts.
Covid-19
Biden says he will immediately put a national strategy in place to “get ahead” of the virus and end the pandemic crisis. That means a nationwide mask mandate and a plan that allows for free and widespread Covid-19 testing, boosting of US medical equipment manufacturing and making any future vaccine “free to everyone, whether or not you’re insured”. 
Having accused Trump of undermining his own health experts, Biden has pledged to keep respected White House coronavirus task force member Anthony Fauci on board. 
He also says he wants to “take the muzzle off our experts” and cancel the process to withdraw the United States from the World Health Organization, which Trump initiated in July.  
Economy 
Effectively reopening the economy is another immediate priority, says Biden.
The Democrat, relying on his experience wooing lawmakers from both political parties, will demand Congress agree on a huge coronavirus relief package to assist struggling families and ravaged small businesses. 
In July, Biden unveiled his “Build Back Better” strategy, a $700 billion blueprint to create millions of jobs. Financing would come through tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans and on major corporations. Biden has also pledged to invest heavily in renewable energies.
Climate Change 
Biden has long called for comprehensive action to combat climate change in the United States, battered by growing numbers of hurricanes and wildfires in recent years. 
“The first thing I will do, I will rejoin the Paris accord,” Biden promised during his debut debate against Trump, who exited the landmark global agreement in 2017. “Because with us out, look what’s happening. It’s all falling apart.”
Biden says he would also convene a climate summit of the world’s leading polluters to “persuade” them to make more ambitious pledges to reduce carbon emissions.
Biden has adopted an ambitious $2 trillion climate change plan including a “clean energy revolution” that aims to achieve net-zero emissions economy-wide no later than 2050.
He also promised to quickly reverse several of Trump’s rollbacks of regulations on environmental standards.
Judicial reform
Biden has promised to quickly appoint a bipartisan national commission that would have 180 days to study the judicial system – which the Democrat said is “getting out of whack” – and propose reforms. 
He has said he is “not a fan” of expanding the US Supreme Court beyond its current nine members.  But other Democrats have expressed a clear preference for the move now that Trump’s third nominee to the bench, Amy Coney Barrett, has been confirmed, cementing its six-three conservative majority.

Biden, who authored numerous tough-on-crime bills when he was a senator, has also called for sweeping criminal justice reform.
His plans include creating a grant programme that encourages states to reduce incarceration and crime, ensuring housing for formerly incarcerated individuals and strategies to reduce repeat offending. 
Immigration 
Biden promised a substantial set of immigration reforms prior to winning the White House.
He announced he would immediately create a federal task force to reunite more than 500 children who were taken from their parents by the Trump administration at the US-Mexico border. 
He said he will also rescind the travel bans that prohibit foreign nationals from several majority Muslim countries from entering the United States.
One of his more controversial steps could be action on the millions of undocumented people living in the United States.
“Within 100 days, I’m going to send to the United States Congress a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented people,” Biden said in his final debate with Trump, on 22 October. 
He also pledged to let children who entered the country with their parents illegally – a group of about 700,000 young people known as Dreamers – to legally stay and take steps toward US citizenship.

From Sharpies to 'dumped ballots': The misinformation being shared about voting in the US
Will he get any of it done? 
Democrats appear to have retained control the House — albeit with a very thin majority — but much of Biden’s agenda could come down to the Senate. 
Democrats needed to pick up three Senate seats to secure a 50-50 split, which looked unlikely early on in the race.
That split would allow Vice President-elect Kamala Harris to act as tie-breaker in any Senate votes until, at least, the 2022 mid-term elections.
Today, it looks like the Democrats look to have picked up one of the three needed. However, two crucial races in Georgia are heading to run-offs, which means a result won’t be decided until 5 January.
If the Democrats lose those run-offs, Biden will face a much different balance of power than he did with Barack Obama back in 2008.
But while Obama came into power with a significant House and Senate majority, Democrats still underwent months of legislative wrangling with Republicans in the minority. 
Biden’s aides have said that the overlapping crises — the pandemic, the economic downturn and the demand for criminal justice reform — lend an urgency to reform that did not exist when Obama was in office, but because of the steep cost of his proposals, Biden may face resistance from most Republicans, and some Democrats, because of the steep cost of his proposals.

Many in the Biden camp are hopeful that his decades of experience on Capitol Hill and reputation as a deal maker will help him broker compromises and build coalitions on both sides of the aisle.
However, these collations will no doubt bring competing pressure from progressives and moderates, and a possible split within the Democratic party on key issues such as climate change and education.

Tánaiste Leo Varadkar recently told his party colleagues that Biden will be positive for Ireland as someone who has a genuine personal attachment to the country beyond “just a golf resort”.
He said Biden has shown an interest in Brexit and its impact on Ireland, particularly what it means for the Good Friday Agreement.
Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and the Democrats have been strong on upholding the Good Friday Agreement before any talk of a UK-US free trade deal begins.  
Under Trump’s presidency, work had already begun on a post-Brexit US-UK trade deal. Biden has previously shown disdain for Boris Johnson – describing him as a “physical and emotional clone” of Trump – so the future of that trade deal is uncertain for now.

Brexit aside, the Biden presidency is unlikely to be much different than Trump’s, Frank Barry, Professor of International Business & Economic Development at TCD previously told TheJournal.ie.
There are talks of Biden tinkering with the margins of the corporate tax regime that Trump instituted in 2017 -  which took on board many aspects of Democratic Party proposal -  but Barry believes the Biden administration won’t change much except raise the corporation tax rates somewhat “because Trump’s was an absolute giveaway to corporations”.
However, Barry said another leaked Biden tax proposal may prove devastating to Ireland and its relationships with multinationals.
Part of the Biden proposals that was leaked was to essentially to impose a minimum tax on American multinational companies abroad. Barry said that rather than calculating the minimum tax liable on these companies overseas, they have to be calculated as a minimum tax per location, “so, that would really damage us”.
“The way it is at the moment is multinationals can essentially ‘mix’ the tax they pay in a high tax jurisdiction with the taxes they pay in a low tax jurisdiction like Ireland, and that’s what they have to balance against the US minimum tax clause.”

“However, it is also vital that they are worn correctly and safely. Ensure you are fully covering both your mouth and nose with the face mask. Remember, visors do not offer the same benefits as face masks,” he said.
“I want to particularly highlight that it is very important that those who work in settings such as retail avoid the use of visors and instead use face masks. Face masks offer far better protection, and they should be worn by everyone who can wear them. Wearing one prevents someone who does not know they have COVID-19 from spreading it to another person.”

Joe Biden has been projected to win the presidency and become the 46th president of the United States after widening his lead in Pennsylvania against Donald Trump, securing the state’s 20 electoral votes and surpassing the necessary 270 to win.
Harris, Biden’s running-mate, will join him in the White House as the first woman elected Vice President in the country’s history.
Harris (56) has already blazed a trail as California’s first black attorney general and the first woman of South-Asian heritage elected to the US Senate.
But winning the vice presidency, a heartbeat away from leading the United States, is the most significant barrier she has broken yet.
If 77-year-Biden chooses to serve only a single four-year term in office Harris would be favoured to win the Democratic presidential nomination in 2024. 
That could give her a shot at continuing to make history – this time as the first female President of the United States.
“My mother raised me to see what could be, unburdened by what has been,” Harris wrote on Twitter last month.
Since being tapped as Biden’s running mate in August, she has slammed President Donald Trump on his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, but also his racism, and handling of issues like the economy and immigration.
Background

Harris was born in California in 1964 to parents who immigrated to the United States – her father from Jamaica and her mother from India. 
Her diploma from the historically black Howard University in Washington was the start of a steady rise that took her from prosecutor, to two elected terms as San Francisco’s district attorney and then California’s attorney general in 2010.
However, Harris’s self-description as a “progressive prosecutor” has been seized upon by critics who say she fought to uphold wrongful convictions and opposed certain reforms in California, like a bill requiring that the attorney general probe shootings involving police.
“Time after time, when progressives urged her to embrace criminal justice reforms as a district attorney and then the state’s attorney general, Ms Harris opposed them or stayed silent,” law professor Lara Bazelon wrote in the New York Times last year.

However, Harris’s work was key to forging a platform and profile from which she launched a successful Senate campaign in 2016, becoming just the second black female senator ever.
Her stint as attorney general also helped her forge a connection with Biden’s son Beau, who held the same position in the state of Delaware, and died of cancer at the age of 46 in 2015.
“I know how much Beau respected Kamala and her work, and that mattered a lot to me, to be honest with you, as I made this decision,” Biden said during his first appearance with Harris as his running mate. 
A veteran campaigner, Harris appears charismatic but can quickly pivot to her prosecutorial persona of relentless interrogation and cutting retorts.

Harris also clashed with Biden during the first Democratic debate, chiding the former senator over his opposition to 1970s busing programmes that forced integration of segregated schools.
“There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public school, and she was bused to school every day,” she said.

Harris was selected as Biden’s running mate in August this year. At the time, Donald Trump said he was “a little surprised” by the selection. 
Trump said Harris “was very disrespectful to Joe Biden” during the Democratic primaries, and said “it’s hard to pick somebody that’s that disrespectful”.

The dogs sniff wipes that passengers have used. It seems they are able to detect traces of the virus days before people develop symptoms and with close to 100 per cent accuracy.
But this is not the main story about dogs and Covid. Without dogs, and indeed cats (I confess that I am not a cat person) I think the toll of despair and depression would have been much higher these past months, particularly among older members of the population (myself included) and those living alone. 
We hear it so often when referring to their dog, people say ‘I would be lost without Fido’, and we nod in agreement.
But there is a lack of recognition and celebration of the important work that dogs do. Dogs are not frontline workers; they cannot look after us and save our lives during a pandemic. But, for many people, they are central to their mental health and well-being.   
Dogs have been useful to humans for thousands of years. In the early stages, dogs and humans hunted together and then, when the move to farming took place, dogs were used for protecting homes, farms and livestock, catching vermin and searching for food. 
Over the years, dogs have been bred to carry out specific tasks. For example, the Glen of Imaal Terrier was bred to hunt badgers; Cocker Spaniels to raise Woodcock. But the uses of dogs have changed.
Cockers are now used to sniff out drugs and, more recently we have learned that Bernese Mountain Dogs are used in Áras an Uachtaráin as diplomatic icebreakers.
From worker to companion
From the beginning, one of the most common uses which humans have had for dogs is as companions and family members. An indication of this is a 12,000-year-old grave in Israel in which a dead woman was found cradling a puppy.  
It used to be that keeping dogs as pets were the preserve of aristocrats. Then, with the industrial revolution, a new urban bourgeoisie began to emerge who treated dogs as luxury items that brought them social distinction.
Over the last two hundred years, this idea of having a dog as a pet has spread throughout the world.
Ireland is no different when it comes to dogs; there are 455,000 of them in this country; one for about every second household. We all either have a dog or know someone who is devoted to one. A recent opinion poll showed that 94 per cent of owners saw their dogs as members of the family.
Over half (54 per cent) would consider ending a relationship if they thought their pup did not like the partner they picked. Over half (56 per cent) said that when they came home, they said hello to their dog first before their loved ones. And just under half (47 per cent) said they found it harder to leave their dog for a week than their human partner. 
A major commitment
Dogs are a burden. They have to be cared for, trained, fed, groomed and walked. And they have to be greeted, petted and talked to. And they are costly. They are particularly costly in 2020, it seems. It is estimated that in the UK, so far this year, the cost of a puppy from the more popular breeds, doubled.
A report on the situation in Ireland during the summer indicated the demand for popular breeds of puppies was so high that prices had increased by up to 800 per cent, from €350 up to €2,700 for a cockapoo or labradoodle, or four times more, from €500 to €2,000, for a Labrador pup. 
Pepe, Tom's dog
Source: Tom Inglis
And dogs are expensive to keep. A study a few years ago suggested that the annual cost of keeping a dog was €2,500. That could be the cost of a family might spend on an annual holiday.  
But look at what they give back. They are a source of companionship, consolation and comfort, particularly in these times. In a world of confusion and uncertainty, they are a major source of meaning and fulfilment. We become attached to them. They bring so much love and it is good to love. 
Unconditional love
In an ideal world, humans would all love one another. We would not be dependent on dogs for love. But love is an emotion. It is not rational and reasonable. People love different things. They fall in and out of love. Humans may be sophisticated, but emotions make them fragile.
This is one of the reasons why we love our dogs. They don’t do emotions. They don’t play at being hurt, sad or resentful. When they are happy, they show it.

She brought me through many tough times, particularly the death of my wife Aileen. When Pepe and I looked into each other’s eyes, I felt a strong sense of bonding, as if we shared the same sense of loss and, at the same time, appreciated the beauty and magic of life and our attachment and commitment to each other.  
Pepe
Humans become attached to all sorts of things. They love and care for them. Often it is unconditional love. Many of us love our partners, parents, children and friends. But many of us also love our dogs and talk to them as if they understand us.
And in these times, when you can’t be with the ones you love, it is okay to love your dog and, equally significant, for that love to be recognised and appreciated.
So, there should be no shame in loving a dog. As well as being great companions, dogs are a source of inspiration. They live in the moment. They live in an enchanted world. They take delight in it.
They do not try to master and control it. They are stoical about the conditions of their existence. There is much that we can learn from them.

UK PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have agreed during a phone call today to “redouble efforts” to reach a trade deal and signed off on talks continuing next week.
Downing Street said the Prime Minister told his Brussels counterpart that there remained “significant differences” in the UK-EU negotiations, with the two sides continuing to be apart on their positions over fishing rights and a level playing field agreement.
The call follows two weeks of intensified talks between the UK’s chief negotiator Lord Frost and his European Union equivalent Michel Barnier, with Johnson and von der Leyen paving the way for further discussions between the pair in London next week.
“Prime Minister Boris Johnson today spoke with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen for a stock take on the progress in the negotiations between the UK and the EU,” a Number 10 spokeswoman said.
“The Prime Minister set out that, while some progress had been made in recent discussions, significant differences remain in a number of areas, including the so-called level playing field and fish.
“The Prime Minister and President agreed that their negotiating teams would continue talks in London next week, beginning on Monday, in order to redouble efforts to reach a deal.
“They agreed to remain in personal contact about the negotiations.”
Briefings between the two leaders are regarded as key moments in the cross-Channel bartering.
Their conversation last month led to discussions being “intensified” before a fallout after the European Council meeting on 15 October briefly derailed the negotiations.
Ireland’s Europe minister Thomas Byrne, speaking before the phone call, cast doubt that the conversation would lead to white smoke on agreeing a deal, saying discussions are still at a “technical level”.
“I personally don’t expect that there would be major progress today but at the same time I think it is very good that the top two are talking – I think that’s really positive but I don’t think we would expect ‘a moment’ at this particular point,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
UK chief negotiator Lord Frost was in the Belgian capital to speak face-to-face with his European Union counterpart Michel Barnier earlier this week as the deadline for doing a deal edges closer.

After talks finished on Wednesday, Barnier briefed MEPs and EU diplomats that “very serious divergences” remain, with only 54 days left until the end of the transition period. 
He said the main stumbling blocks continue to be around the “level playing field” aimed at preventing unfair competition on areas including state subsidies, fisheries policy and the governance of any deal.
After the phone call,  Frost tweeted: “Prime Minister Boris Johnson and commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke today about our negotiations with the EU.
“My talks with Michel Barnier will continue in London on Monday.”
He previously said progress has been made during two weeks of intensive negotiations but “wide divergences remain on some core issues”.
Minister of State for European Affairs Thomas Byrne said earlier today that he doubted the conversation between von der Leyen and Johnson would make a significant difference in the EU-UK trade talks.
“I personally don’t expect that there would be major progress today but at the same time I think it is very good that the top two are talking,” said Byrne, speaking on the BBC Radio 4 programme Today.
Byrne doesn’t believe that the chief negotiators should be sidelined and that heads of state shouldn’t be engaging to achieve a deal.
“No, Ursula von der Leyen, Michel Barnier… they speak on behalf of all Europeans, individual member states don’t – that’s the way the European Union works,” said Byrne.","The briefing is seen as a key moment in the discussions after negotiations derailed in October.",9,0,0,22852,"Nov 7th 2020, 11:28 AM"

The new restrictions will include people travelling for essential reasons after the new strain of coronavirus spread to humans from mink in Denmark.
Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan has confirmed the move. 
“People will have to self-isolate for 14 days no matter what. People coming from Denmark, there isn’t huge numbers, but we are following the health advice, similar to what’s going on in the UK,” said Ryan, speaking on RTÉ’s Saturday with Katie Hannon.
The strain has not been reported on Irish mink farms, and both the Heath Surveillance Protection Centre and National Virus Reference Laboratory have confirmed that no cases of the mutation have been reported in Ireland.
There are currently three Irish mink farms, and the Department of Agriculture confirmed that no mink have been imported in 2020.
The Department of Agriculture also has said that it will be carrying out testing on all three farms to see if the virus is present in Irish mink. 
According to the Department of Health, the HSE will be carrying out serial testing of all mink farm workers as well as their household contacts.
Denmark was forced to cull all of their mink, due to the mutated strain spreading from animals to humans. 
The mutation “could pose a risk that future (coronavirus) vaccines won’t work the way they should,” said Denmark’s Prime Minister, Mette Frederiksen.

As the worlds largest producer of mink fur, Denmark has 1,080 mink farms, with Covid-19 being detected on 207 of them.
According to the World Health Organisation, on 5 November, health authorities in Denmark reported 12 cases of Covid-19 that were caused by a mink-associated strain of the novel coronavirus.
Eight of these cases had links to mink farms, while the remaining four were from the local community.
Lab tests conducted then found that this strain may have reduced response to neutralising antibodies from Covid-19, according to the WHO.

Director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory Cillian De Gascun has said that a specific limitation on the number of close contacts could help to keep transmission low after Level 5 restrictions are eased next month.
Speaking on Saturday with Katie Hannon on RTÉ Radio One, De Gascun said that the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) is considering how to prevent a rise in Covid-19 transmission after the current restrictions are lifted.
“Nobody wants to go through rolling Level 5 restrictions on and off. That’s not really helpful for anyone,” De Gascun said.
He said that public health officials “may need to look at a situation whereby there’s a limited number of close contacts that we can have in a weekly period”.
NPHET would need to consider the “specific numbers” of close contacts that might be allowed in a week under such a restriction.
“The challenge is identifying what that number of close contacts is going to be because we want the R0 to ideally be below one, and the problem is if we’re looking at say, for argument’s sake, three close contacts versus four close contacts, that could flip the balance of an R0 from below one to above one,” De Gascun said.
We need to focus on what we want to prioritise as a society and then what we can do from a discretionary perspective.”
De Gascun said that a limit on close contacts would not necessarily eliminate social settings such as pubs and restaurants.
“We’ll have to look at what the high-risk settings and low-risk settings are,” he said. 
“It all comes down to wanting to live as much of our life as we can in a safe way while also preventing the cases increasing dramatically as they did in October

“We want this to be beneficial and we want to get the benefit out of this and we don’t want it to be a waste of time.
When we come out of the six weeks, we can’t do what we did in August and September, because obviously that didn’t work.”
“Therefore, what we will be doing from a NPHET perspective over the next couple of weeks in conjunction with colleagues in the HSE and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre is looking at how we can be better in December and January,” De Gascun said.

US President Donald Trump, who appears to be on the verge of having lost Tuesday’s election to challenger Joe Biden, has applied a “maximum pressure” policy and punishing sanctions against Iran since his 2018 withdrawal from a landmark nuclear agreement with Iran.
“We hope the three-year experience will be a lesson for America’s next administration to abide by laws and regulations and return to its commitments,” Rouhani said in a televised speech.
“Our people have faced economic terrorism for the past three years.”
Rouhani said Iran would “continue its resistance and patience until the other side bows before laws and regulations”.
He said he hoped that that “those imposing sanctions realise their path was wrong and that they will not achieve their goals in any way”.
Iranian officials have said they will focus on the policies of the next US administration rather than who becomes president.
Tehran has also stressed that a possible US return to the nuclear agreement would have to be accompanied by compensation for damages caused by the withdrawal and a “guarantee” it will not be repeated.
Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Tuesday that the US election would have “no effect” on Tehran’s policies towards Washington.
Biden has said he plans to embark on a “credible path to return to diplomacy” with Iran if he wins the presidency and raised the possibility of returning to the 2015 nuclear deal, negotiated when he was vice president under Barack Obama.

Had he stayed in the Premier County, he reckons he would have been consigned to a life of the small fish trying to make it in the big pond.
But at 23, he left his home in Killenaule and followed his heart up to Derry where his wife is from, and put down his roots there.
At the time, he was playing football for the senior county team and won an All-Ireland B medal with that side. He had also hurled at U21 level for Tipp. 
A trial with the senior team, he reckons, wouldn’t have been beyond his reach. But he relocated to the North before he could find out.
He didn’t play any hurling for the first year of living in Derry, and actually lined out for the county team before commencing his club career with his local Banagher outfit.
“I played county before I played club up here which is mad,” he tells The42.
Up here, if they hear you’re from a hurling county, they’re on your case straight away.”
What followed was an impressive career which yielded an All-Ireland B hurling medal to go with the one he earned back in Tipperary. There are also back-to-back Ulster SHC titles in his cabinet, the first of which came during the 2000 season after finally edging out their rivals Antrim.
That first Ulster success led the Oak Leaf County to venture out of the province for the first time in 92 years. They were paired with Offaly in the All-Ireland quarter-final, a  heavyweight hurling side of the 90s who had captured the Liam MacCarthy Cup just two years before that.
O’Dwyer scored two points that day as Derry just came up short in causing a stunning upset at Croke Park, losing out by six points to a more experienced side.
“We weren’t confident or any of that kind of stuff,” O’Dwyer recalls about the day they took on Offaly as massive underdogs.
“We were actually hoping we’d put up a good show and as it turned out, we actually had a great day. We played fierce well as a team.
We stayed the night before and got a Garda escort in and we wouldn’t have been used to that. It was a great weekend, really enjoyable. We didn’t get carried away with it either.
“We had mass and the escort in, and it’s only then when you see the supporters going in that you’re like, ‘This is bigger than what we’ve been doing.’
There were several household names buttressing the Offaly side that took to the field that day. Michael Duignan, Johnny Pilkington and Johnny Dooley were all among the starters while Brian Whelahan and Joe Dooley were both sprung from the bench.
The Faithful needed reinforcements as Derry soon proved to be a stickier prospect than they anticipated. The teams were level at the hour mark of the game and a shock Derry win was a real prospect.
Johnny Dooley told the Irish Independent this week that the tightness of the game was “nightmare stuff”. He added that the crowds that were arriving for the second quarter-final between Tipperary and Galway were showing their preference for Derry while Offaly supporters travelled in low numbers that day.
O’Dwyer is confident that Derry capitalised on every chance that was presented to them, and points to some key individual performances that illuminated their display.
Geoffrey McGonigle bagged two goals while Michael Collins and Kieran McKeever also stand out in O’Dwyer’s memory. Ollie Collins was their “talisman,” but he was forced off with injury.
But even with all the momentum that was behind them, O’Dwyer was never fully confident of a Derry win.

“We were level with 10 or 15 minutes to go, you’re thinking we could kind of pull this off. But at the end of the day, at that level, you always felt Offaly would have enough to pull away, and they did in the end. They beat us by six points.
“But we gave them a good game, we had a good squad that year. That team had been building up.
“Ollie Collins was our main player. Having your best man coming off was a blow.

“I probably didn’t have time to think if we could win it or not. We were under that much pressure and you were hoping that you might get a lucky chance or whatever. Dooley kept scoring and he was causing mayhem.
In the moment, you’re just trying to do the best you can. We were flat to the mat for the whole game. Everything was going 100 miles per hour.”
After a tense fight for much of the contest, Offaly’s experience prevailed as they stretched their advantage throughout the concluding stages of the game.
They went on to contest the All-Ireland final later that year where they were emphatically dispatched by an emerging Kilkenny outfit.
As for Derry, O’Dwyer insists that there were no feelings of regret after the final whistle. They came down to Dublin determined to bring a fight to the pitch and they delivered on that promise before having “a right good night”.
Even if they did manage to win, Cork would have been waiting for the Ulster champions in the semi-final and O’Dwyer suspects they would have lost that tie by a much bigger margin.
And there were other strong teams lurking about at that time that Derry managed to dodge.
“Offaly was probably the best team to suit us,” says O’Dwyer. “Tipperary and Galway played the other quarter-final, and if we got either of them, they’d probably have roasted us.
“Offaly wouldn’t have been as mobile an outfit. They’re good skilful hurlers, but they wouldn’t be as mobile. We were quite a big team and we were all very mobile. That helped us with Offaly, we were able to get stuck into them and get on top of them.
“It would have been nice but I think Derry got a boost anyway for that period of time. The problem was they beat Cork in the semi-final and I don’t think we would have come anywhere close to beating Cork. We could have ended up getting a right hammering off Cork and that would have put us back into a flash in the pan.”

O’Dwyer says he started that Offaly game at full-forward but was moved out to the corner where he was picked up by All-Ireland winner, and star Birr defender, Simon Whelahan.
All-Ireland senior quarter-finals don’t normally include Derry, and O’Dwyer wanted to make sure he had a memento from the occasion.
“I started on [Kevin] Kinahan and then I moved into the corner on Whelahan and we had a right old time. He had marked me a couple of times in the league and I swapped with him. For us, you’re not going to get that many chances to swap in an All-Ireland quarter-final so I actually said it to him.
I kept it and it’s something I will always keep. It’s one of the only jerseys I have kept.”
20 years on from that famous clash, Offaly and Derry are reunited for the first time in a hurling championship fixture this weekend. It’s not at Liam MacCarthy level anymore however, as both sides are competing in the Christy Ring Cup these days.
The wheel turns of course, and there are some connections between those squads from 2000 with today’s panels. Michael Duignan’s son Brian is hurling for the Offaly seniors, while Kieran McKeever’s son Odhrán is on the Derry squad.
O’Dwyer’s son Johnny is also involved with the Derry team. 
Looking at how the result will fall this time around, O’Dwyer is leaning towards another Offaly win, but just like in 2000, Derry won’t relinquish anything easily.
“Offaly are nowhere near the team they used to be,” says O’Dwyer. “They’re way back. Derry aren’t too bad. They still don’t have all the players they should but they’ve more than they had five or six years ago. Derry’s panels change depending on how the football is going.
“They’re solid, a big strong team. I wouldn’t imagine they’ll have enough for Offaly but we’ll see.”

Giammattei said an army unit had arrived in the northern village of Queja to begin rescue efforts, amid fears that most of the residents had been killed.
A preliminary report indicated that “150 homes have been buried with 100 people dead,” he said.
Giammattei added that another mudslide in the northeastern department of Huehuetenango, on the border with Mexico, had left 10 dead.
“We calculate that between the dead and the missing, unofficial figures show about 150 dead,” said Giammattei, updating the country’s death toll from the 50 fatalities he had reported on Thursday.
He called the situation in Queja “critical,” with heavy rain continuing to fall and setting off new mudslides, while roads are still blocked.
Some 2,500 people in the impoverished Mayan indigenous area had lost their belongings in the deluge of mud.
Flash-flooding risk
Eta tore through Central America, leaving death and destruction in its wake since it first rocked Nicaragua as a Category 4 hurricane.
Two days later it exited Honduras as a tropical depression, although forecasters warned it could again strengthen into a tropical storm as it heads towards Cuba.
Cuba began taking measures on Friday to soften Eta’s impact, ahead of the storm’s expected arrival on Sunday.
Despite Eta having lost power, the US National Hurricane Center continued to warn of “life-threatening flash flooding” over portions of Central America.
The storm brought heavy rain that caused deadly flooding in Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Panama.
Two people died in Nicaragua, where Eta tore through impoverished coastal areas and swept away whole villages.
In Honduras, 10 people were killed by landslides and floods, authorities said, warning there could be more victims.
Thousands remain stranded in Sula Valley, the industrial hub of Honduras, and some have been appealing for help through the media.
“We need a boat or helicopter. We haven’t had food in two days, there’s about 60 people here with children,” a woman told Today program on Friday from Ciudad Planeta. 
The Honduran government said Friday that 16,000 people had been rescued from Sula Valley.
In Panama, the damage was concentrated in Chiriqui province, on the border with Costa Rica, where the storm destroyed homes, roads, bridges and crops.

Eight people have died, Security Minister Juan Pino said, and the toll could rise with dozens missing and heavily damaged areas inaccessible.
“We are just starting with this titanic task,” Pino said. 
In Costa Rica, a 71-year-old American and his Costa Rican wife died when a landslide buried their home in the southern canton of Coto Brus, on the border with Panama.
Around 1,400 people in the south and Pacific coastal regions were taken to shelters after heavy rainfall saw rivers break their banks and flood vast areas.
A fisherman was killed on Thursday in El Salvador, where authorities evacuated 1,700 people whose homes were at risk from flooding, the civil protection agency said.
As the surface layer of oceans warms due to climate change, hurricanes are becoming more powerful and carrying more water, posing an increasing threat to the world’s coastal communities, scientists say.  
Storm surges amplified by rising seas can be especially devastating.

1069,199,"'I got very emotional on the field afterwards. I just felt, 'Is this me gone now?'",https://www.the42.ie/2010-all-ireland-football-championship-5257378-Nov2020/,"HERE’S HOW IT looked back then.
Cork had been crowned All-Ireland champions. Down came up just short in that September final. Kildare were only two points shy at the semi-final stage. Roscommon celebrated a Connacht win before making a last eight exit.
Meath won silverware in Croke Park. Sligo and Limerick lost deciders, Louth were defeated as well in the most luckless and controversial fashion possible. All four provincial winners lost their quarter-finals.
It was the year after the period where Kerry and Tyrone carved up seven titles, the year before Dublin’s blue wave came crashing across the Gaelic football landscape.
The 2010 championship, a summer of action that stands as an outlier in the Gaelic football narrative. An array of storylines that look more novel and compelling with every passing season.
Of the five counties that have contested an All-Ireland final since, only Dublin played in August that year. Kerry and Tyrone were toppled on a seismic July evening. Mayo were stunned by Longford and Donegal cast aside by Armagh on the same June day in the qualifiers.
And the outlook now for those in the 2010 leading pack?
Cork have only been to an All-Ireland semi-final once since then, in 2012 the year of their last Munster victory. Down and Kildare haven’t returned to the last four stage or won their provincial championship.
Roscommon have lived up to their end of the bargain, successful in two recent Connacht finals and All-Ireland last eight regulars.
Cork’s Colm O’Neill, Down’s Mark Poland, Kildare’s Johnny Doyle and Roscommon’s Karol Mannion were all central characters in 2010.

Mannion was the first of them to retire from the inter-county game when he called it a day in January 2014, Doyle did likewise three months later. Poland departed in November 2017, O’Neill was forced to go due to injury by July 2018.
Tomorrow their four counties set out on the 2020 championship road. November is an odd starting point as Cork entertain Kerry, Kildare meet Offaly, Roscommon host Mayo and Down travel to Fermanagh.
All still avidly follow the local fortunes, forced to support now from the couch instead of the stand. The Gaelic football climate has undergone major change since 2010, yet a decade on the group can appreciate that summer spent in the national sporting limelight.

Pre-Championship mood
Mark Poland: “That year there was an awful buzz back around the county because Wee James had come in. I hadn’t been about the previous years. I’d been there before in 2005. It was one of the few times where every top club player in Down was available.
“And Marty (Clarke) was back from Australia. He added something massive to the whole setup. It gave our forwards more freedom as well, he was the one that got the attention.”
Karol Mannion (Roscommon): “After 2005 a lot of the senior players weren’t asked back. The panel became very young and we went into a pretty bad period. 
“We’d come off a bad year with Mayo hammering us in Connacht, then we’d a couple of injuries in that 2010 league and ended up going down to Division 4. We lost to Sligo in the very last game, they beat us easy in Markievicz. It wasn’t a good time.”
Colm O’Neill (Cork): “Finishing off in 2009 being beaten in the All-Ireland final, we were obviously gutted. When you’re going back to pre-season you’ve only one thing on your mind, it’s righting the wrong. But you’re back the same as everyone else in the competition at square one.”
Early Provincial Days
Mannion: “I got into the Roscommon panel at the end of 2001, had played in one Connacht final in 2004. So in 2010 we’d a great opportunity to get there, just get through London and Leitrim.”
O’Neill: “We played below in Killarney, a sweltering hot day. It was the second year in a row we drew with them, we went back to Cork and Kerry beat us after extra-time. We were going into the unknown then, you weren’t even thinking about the bigger picture.”
Poland: “We got to the league final, didn’t perform against Armagh but I think it was a blessing in disguise. We’d Brian McIver and Paddy Tally along then too. Brian didn’t suffer any fools, he wasn’t happy with that league performance.
“If we had won, I think we might have gone into the Donegal game with a different mindset. I’m not saying our season took off then, Tyrone turned us over in the Ulster semi-final.”
Johnny Doyle: “We played really great football that night, kicked some fantastic scores but Louth were just better. 
“I just licked my wounds very quickly. Kieran (McGeeney) was very good at getting you ready for the next competition. Before he arrived the All-Ireland series was nearly like a hangover cure and we failed miserably most years up to that.”

Mannion: “We’d the game against London, three weeks to Leitrim and four weeks to a Connacht final. After the league a number of key players came back from injury. We were training well, had the two wins and galvanised us a group. We were getting great guidance from Fergal and his management team. That was a key factor.
The Backdoor
O’Neill: “We drew Cavan at home in the qualifiers. I’ll never forget that game, the conditions were awful. Wexford game, the same. It was a pure slog, the standard wouldn’t have been hectic.
“But the qualifiers is all about getting over the line and into the bowl for the next round. You could see after those two games, we were starting to build a small bit of momentum.”
Poland: “The Offaly one we scraped through by the skins of our teeth. There’s a big story around that, everybody in Down knows. The bus driver actually had us heading for Mullingar that day. I just remember sitting on the bus and seeing signs for Mullingar and thinking, ‘Right boys where are we going to here?’
“We only arrived in Tullamore 20 minutes before throw-in, things were a wee bit chaotic. That day really showed the mettle of the team. Next day out we let loose in Breffni Park against Sligo. From that day we didn’t look back.”

Kildare faced Antrim but the game was overshadowed by the sad passing that week of Dermot Earley Senior, the father of the Lilywhites inspirational midfielder. The funeral took place on the morning of the game.
Doyle: “The big thing for us, and again it’s a selfish thing, was Dermot going to play? Dermot was such a massive part of our team. 
“I know Dermot very well on a personal level. I remember going down to the house and chatting.
“I said, ‘Look it whatever you decide you want to do, is the right thing to do. Don’t be worrying about us’.
“He rang me later on that night saying he was talking to his Ma and that’s what his Da would have wanted him to do was to play. Knowing Dermot and Dermot Snr, and what representing your county, what being part of something bigger than yourself, it was a huge part of what they were.
“We’d paid our respects when we met in the Curragh for the wake in the Army Church. We were ushered in the side door, I remember standing waiting and it was a who’s who of the GAA. You were pointing out there’s Páidí Ó Sé and there’s Tony Hanahoe and there’s Larry Tompkins.
“The crowd in Newbridge for the game was just phenomenal. I do remember saying, Whatever else happens, we’re not leaving here as losers’.

“And by God we were close to losing that game. At least we got another day out. If we’d lost that, it could have left a big dent on us as players.”
Reaching The Quarter-Finals
O’Neill: “Limerick would have felt at that time they’d Cork’s number. That night in the Gaelic Grounds, for the heart of the supporters it wasn’t the best.
“Limerick were a top team then. Johnny McCarthy was a tough competitor, at the time one of the best man markers in the country. Ask any lad and he’d say that about him. To win a game after extra-time builds a bit of resilience and a bit of fight.
Doyle: “We got a bit of momentum after the Antrim draw. Sometimes when Kildare were expected to win was their toughest days. We didn’t do the favourites tag really well. We put in a really good performance up in Derry, I’d suffered a few tough defeats up there.
“We’d come off a victory and were in a happier place than Monaghan were coming off a provincial final loss. I’d a terrible game. Ronan Sweeney got a goal for us, we did well to get over that day.”
Silverware At Last
18 July: Roscommon 0-14 Sligo 0-13 – Donie Shine scored 0-10.
Mannion: “During the 2000s Sligo were a great team to watch, some brilliant players that you would admire. I loved watching Eamonn O’Hara play, some of the defenders as well, Charlie Harrison and Ross Donovan.
“We were in good shape when we got to that Connacht final. In fairness you couldn’t but think, ‘Jeez we’ve beaten Galway and Mayo, this is a huge opportunity’, when you were from Sligo. We were gone to Division 4 and we were under the radar. It was certainly set up for us. A lot of the times when that was the case, it doesn’t work out. We nailed the performance on the day. We kept tabs on their best players.
“Donie’s role, you can’t understate what he did for Roscommon to win that game. It was a dream performance to watch a team-mate do that. His first Connacht final as a 22-year-old to do that. I’ll thank him until I end up in the grave, it was great to have him on the team that day.”

Quarter-Finals
31 July: Down 1-16 Kerry 1-10; Dublin 1-15 Tyrone 1-13.
1 August: Cork 1-16 Roscommon 0-10; Kildare 2-17 Meath 1-12.
Poland: “It was the first time I’d played in Croke Park in a championship game. You were going in with a mentality of, ‘Am I going to get a chance to play here again?’.

“I actually over lockdown watched the video of it. The hunger and work rate from our forward line set the tone early on.”
O’Neill: ”It’s a results business. The plan is to go out play great football and put up a big score but sometimes that’s not always possible. The qualifiers is all about dogging it out and that quarter-final was the same focus for us.”
Mannion: ”We’d one night of celebration after the Connacht final but we knuckled down again. We decided we wanted to have a cut off it, the minors from ’06 would have been very much to the fore in wanting to push it on.
“We were leading five-ten minutes into the second half, but they just hit us where it hurt. They were a mature team and could turn the screw on teams like ourselves who were developing.”

Doyle: “We started that match pretty poor, lost Dermot early, he did his cruciate. James Kavanagh got an unbelievable goal, coolness personified. That was Jimmer, he’d such ability. We just got a couple of vital scores to pull away.
“I hadn’t kicked well the previous game and I put in savage hours kicking frees trying to get it right. The first one I got, I’d kick it with my eyes closed normally but it was a greasy ball and I kicked it wide. I swear to God, I could have dug a hole and got into it at that stage. Thankfully I got another couple of chances and they flew over.”
Poland: “The ball just fell to me early on (in the first minute). It was the one opportunity and I wasn’t going to let it go by easily.
“There’s actually a funny story to it. One of my friends from Longstone had a bet placed on me that day for first goal. He was late getting into the ground, walked in not knowing anything until half-time.
“Then he was like, ‘Here who actually did score the Down goal?’
“He couldn’t believe it. I think it was 22-1. He was a happy man in Dublin that night.”

Last Four
22 August: Cork 1-15 Dublin 1-14
O’Neill: “One of the games that stands out for me throughout my whole career. The atmosphere, the noise, the colour. The conditions were perfect, the crowd was humming. It was just pure championship. 
“It was thrown at Dublin that they couldn’t get past the line and discipline would have been thrown at them as well. They were probably in a comfortable enough position, gave away a sloppy penalty. A lot of stick was dished at them after that game, we came from behind, and pipped them at the end.

29 August: Down 1-16 Kildare 1-14
Doyle: ”Once we knew we were playing Down, Kieran knew them and James McCartan very well. There was talk that it was going to be a Kildare-Cork final, he’d to quench that very quick. I certainly didn’t let it grow legs in my head. I was 32 so I’d a bit of experience.”
Poland: ”It’s one game everybody seems to bring up to me. It was a really warm, hot day. The red and black, and the white around the stadium. The way the game went, the excitement at the end was crazy. The buzz coming off the field that day, it was unbelievable.” 
Doyle: “You’ll win nothing without a bit of luck. Losing Dermot was massive. To me in ’09, he was in the top three footballers in the country. 
“The Benny Coulter goal, look it, it is what it is. No disrespect to Benny, he went hard for the ball as he always did. The disappointing thing is that the week before Kildare got a fine and Aidan O’Rourke got a two-match ban because he came onto the field too many times. They were quick to find out but a square ball decides whether you’re in an All-Ireland final or not.
“Even the Rob Kelly shot at the end, to me the ball was picked off the ground in the square. Should we have had a penalty?”

Poland: ”I know Kildare ones hark back to Benny’s goal but I think Pat McEnaney evened the game up as well, Callaghan took about ten steps for his goal. You’d always feel for the likes of Johnny Doyle, fellas that were so close to playing in the ultimate game of anybody’s career. But I definitely do think over the 70 minutes we were the better footballing team.”

Doyle: “You can’t get too bogged down. You’d be talking to people even now, they’d say we would’ve won the All-Ireland. I’m sure Cork would have had their say on that too. That Eamonn Callaghan goal, technically he took too many steps. We’ll always talk and maybe it makes us feel a bit better as well that we could have won it. You park those and move on.”
Battle For Sam
O’Neill: ”Thinking back the conditions were very tricky at times, there was a good bit of rain. When you get to those positions in finals, people only remember the winners. They’re just there to be won and thankfully we got over the line.”
Colm O'Neill celebrates after Cork's victory.
Source: Cathal Noonan
Poland: ”The end of the first half, we were four or five up and Cork got a free around the middle of the field. Somebody said or did something and the ref brought it up. Donncha O’Connor knocked it over and it seemed to give Cork energy. From speaking to Wee James, being involved in the minors this year and chatting about it, he said that too, that point seemed to lift them in some way.
“When they started to claw us back in the second half we were making mistakes. That’s the really frustrating thing looking back. But look, Goulding never missed a free kick that day either too, he punished every indiscretion. You have to appreciate that skill too. Looking back you can’t begrudge them one either, they’d been beaten in two finals.”
2010 Reflections
Mannion: “Roscommon have sporadically won Connacht titles, we have come with teams every ten years or so. It’s a very hard thing to come by. I was there so long with Roscommon, it was so hard to win anything that when you finally win something, I was so happy to get it. I thought I might never win one.”
Doyle: “The Down defeat was a harder one to take on a personal level because I was 32. You’re thinking, ‘Jesus will I ever get the opportunity again?’
“I got very emotional on the field afterwards. I just felt, ‘Is this me gone now?’ I’d given everything I had to Kildare and I wouldn’t change it, I loved it. I’d been in jobs that didn’t suit the football, so I got a new job. It was my life. You’re just thinking how close we were.”

Poland: “In 2010 we thought that was the way it was always going to be for years ahead. But obviously that wasn’t the case. I remember in 2012 we got beaten in Ulster final, we were one of the few teams that came through the six-day turnaround. Then we got Mayo in the quarter-final and probably we were a wee bit naive, they trounced us that day.”
The 2020 winter championship
O’Neill: ”I do think the trajectory Cork are on is an upward curve. There’s been two All-Ireland underage successes which is not something not to be sniffed at. But there’s a huge battle ahead of them  this weekend and the big question is can they close the gap?
Mannion: “It’s been brilliant since I finished up to see how good Roscommon have been. Enda Smith, his first year was my last year. Enda and his generation, a good group, extremely dedicated and they had the class as well to push Roscommon on. Getting to the next level now is their ambition.
Poland: “I’ve got a brother (Conor) on the team. It was strange initially when the boys were just gone back to training but now the football’s on TV, the buzz they’re getting. Getting out of Division 3 was a massive thing. Teams like Down could get on a run, you just don’t know. Hopefully on Sunday they can get over the line.”
Dublin’s Dominance
O’Neill: “You could see that day in 2010 they were starting to come. James McCarthy, Paul Flynn, Bernard Brogan were just coming into their prime. They’d the U21 teams after them. When Jim Gavin came in, it was total discipline and a mindset that got them over the line. You see how dominant they’ve been since.”
Source: James Crombie/INPHO
Mannion: “The game has moved on a lot from 2010, the margins between the top teams and everyone else are widening. It is going to be harder for a team a tier below the top level to upset it. You’ve Dublin, then Kerry, they’re going to be very hard to catch.”
Poland: “It’s scary how far Dublin have got ahead of other counties and how far teams like Down have dropped back. My last game was against Monaghan in 2017. I remember having it in the back of my head that if we win this game, we play Dublin in the quarter-final.
“I’d the idea it could be my swansong. But was also thinking is this going to be a good thing for the long-term development of the younger players? They were so far ahead of the pack. You have to hold your hands up and be honest.”
Doyle: “If you were asked to pick six teams to win the All-Ireland, you probably wouldn’t be able to name them. There’s not as many teams in the mix now.
“I wouldn’t take in any way from Dublin, what they’ve done is phenomenal. To win five-in-a-row, I never thought I’d see the day.
“But you’d love to see somebody else come in and shake it up.
“Or three or four teams to challenge to make the All-Ireland series more competitive. That’s what made 2010 that bit different.”

I don’t know if my face would have agreed with them at 6 am while en route to make scones this morning… nippy.
And as we face into the unknown that is winter with Covid-19, the question of food sustainability and security is more pertinent given the year that was.
Considering the environmental and animal welfare clouds over the agricultural industry and the effects a pandemic can have on food supply, as a chef and restaurant owner, I have to ask myself if I’m doing enough to contribute positively to the environment.
We can probably all recognise now that change is needed and some changes indeed are happening in food worldwide. If you doubt this shift, just consider the juggernaut that is the plant-based industry. 
That’s not to say I’m going all out as a vegan here as that’s a more personal topic depending on your point of view but if I’m to help the environment as a chef then there are three factors for me – what suppliers to support, what my customers require and then matching those with cost and viability.
Every little helps
Individually, it may be easier than you think to make food choices that are kinder to the planet. Your wallet and body will thank you and help you feel like you’re reducing our footprint on the earth.
It should be noted that I say all this as a card-carrying, Irish Angus-loving carnivore who will be buried with a block of Kerrygold so I am in no way questioning or judging eating habits – merely ruminating on this most timely of topics.
So how, as modern chefs and restauranters, do we keep farmer, picky-eater, meat eater, veggie, vegan, salad dodger and omnivore happy? It’s quite the smorgasbord of palates to cater for.
There’s a simple answer – consider eating meat and fish a little less often and spend a little more on locally sourced, free-range produce from our amazing butchers and fishmongers. It’s a win-win, right?
That’s the ideal, but don’t forget that on these winter evenings, a hearty vegetarian dish is the tastiest and healthiest thing, and so easy. Plus, environmentally, you’re on the (vegan) pig’s back.
Try to eat locally and seasonally as much as possible, in the globalised world we all love our Avo Toast but it’s a schlep for those fellas to get here in January.

Libertarian candidate Shane Hazel was able to get enough votes so that neither Mr Perdue nor Mr Ossoff was able to clear the 50 per cent threshold needed for an outright win.
Thousands of absentee ballots and in-person votes cast early needed to be counted after Election Night passed, forcing a long and tense wait before the race could be called.
The contest will be one of two in Georgia in January that is likely to settle which party controls the Senate.
Democrat Raphael Warnock and Senator Kelly Loeffler, the Republican-appointed last year, will also compete in a run-off on the same day.
Nationally, the Senate stands at 48-48.
But Republicans lead uncalled races in Alaska and North Carolina, so the ultimate balance is likely to come down to what happens in the Georgia run-offs.
Both sides promised unlimited funds would flow to the campaigns and onto the airwaves, and they predicted an all-star cast of campaigners for a state that in recent weeks drew visits from Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris and former President Barack Obama.

The race between Mr Ossoff and Mr Perdue, a close ally of Mr Trump, has been characterised by sharp attack adverts but relatively moderate political positions.
Both candidates pivoted to the middle vying for a state Mr Trump won handily four years ago, but where swaths of suburbia have shown signs of disillusionment with the president.
Mr Perdue sought to cast his opponent as backing a “radical socialist agenda,” while Mr Ossoff portrayed Mr Perdue as a “corrupt” Washington insider who has been part of a botched pandemic response.","Two Senate races in the battleground state did not meet the required results to declare a victor.",0,0,0,18088,"Nov 7th 2020, 7:28 AM"

Two senior administration officials confirmed that Meadows had tested positive for the virus, which has killed more than 236,000 Americans so far this year.
Meadows travelled with Trump in the run-up to Election Day and last appeared in public early on Wednesday morning – without a mask – as Trump falsely declared victory in the vote count.
He had been one of the close aides around Trump when the president came down with the virus more than a month ago, but was tested daily and maintained his regular work schedule.
It marked the latest case of the virus in the West Wing, coming less than a fortnight after Marc Short, vice president Mike Pence’s chief of staff, and other aides tested positive for the virus.
Trump, first lady Melania Trump, and at least two dozen others tested positive for the virus in early October, after Trump held large gatherings of people not wearing face masks, including the ceremony announcing the nomination of now-Justice Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.
Trump has repeatedly said that the nation is “rounding the turn” on the pandemic.

Speaking from a stage in Wilmington, Delaware, he spoke of winning the election with historic support while acknowledging that no final declaration has been made yet. 
“The numbers tell us a clear and convincing story,” he said.
“We’re going to win this race with a clear majority with a nation behind us.”
He claimed he is going to win Georgia, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Nevada – all states still being counted but where he has leads.
24 hours (ago), we were behind in Georgia, now we’re ahead, and we’re going to win that state.
24 hours ago, we were behind in Pennsylvania and we are going to win Pennsylvania. Now we’re ahead, we’re winning in Arizona, winning in Nevada, in fact our lead just doubled in Nevada.”
“We’re on track to 300 electoral college votes, and look at the national numbers.”
With counting still ongoing, the Biden/Kamala Harris ticket has broken voting records.
“We’ve gotten over 74 million votes, that’s more than any presidential ticket has ever gotten in the history of the United States of America.
And our vote total is still growing. We’re beating Donald Trump by over four million votes and that’s a margin that’s still growing as well.”
He hailed the Democratic party for winning Arizona and Georgia back from Republicans, and for rebuilding the Blue Wall in the mid-west that “crumbled just four years ago”. 
In a defence of the electoral process, he said that tallies “aren’t not just number”.

“I know watching these vote tallies on TV moves very slow and as slow as it goes it can be numbing.
But never forget the tallies aren’t just numbers, they represent votes and voters, men and women who exercised their fundamental right to have their voice heard.
“And what’s becoming clear each hour is that a record number of Americans of all races, faiths, religions chose change over more of the same. They’ve given us a mandate for action, on Covid, the economy, climate change, systemic racism.”
He said that he and Harris had held meetings with scientists today to start their work around the pandemic. He cautioned that America could see daily cases skyrocket, and that there could be a situation where 200,000 cases are being reported each day.  
Today, 125,000 positive cases were reported. 
Finally, Biden appealed for calm and patience while the counting continues. 
“I know tensions can be high after a tough election like the one we’ve had,” he said. “But we need to remain calm. Patient. And let the process work out as we count all the votes.

1075,180,"New travel traffic light system kicks in on Sunday - here's what you need to know",https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-traffic-light-system-5256583-Nov2020/,"AFTER MONTHS OF uncertainty about international travel, it’s hoped a new EU plan will help jump start the aviation sector in a safe way. 
The new EU traffic light system was signed off at EU level on 13 October.
Previous to this, there was mainly an adhoc system in place, with many countries deciding their own rules and regulations. 
While the majority of the EU countries opened their borders in June – allowing for tourists to go away on holidays or people to travel for business – Ireland took a stricter approach than many.
The Green List permitted travel for non-essential reasons to a very limited (and, it turned out, ever dwindling) set of locations. That system has since been scrapped in favour of the new EU-wide system.
So what is this new plan?
The EU traffic light system for international travel will come into effect in Ireland from tomorrow.
Under the plan, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control will publish a weekly map of the EU using a three-stage colour system (green, orange and red) to indicate the level of risk in each area.
Levels will be determined by a variety of epidemiological factors including the 14-day incidence per 100,000 population and the level of positive tests.
The updated map is published weekly on Thursdays.
If you are arriving from a green region, what does that mean?
Currently, there are no green countries on the list, but people arriving into Ireland from EU green regions do not have to restrict their movement for 14 days. 
Okay, what if you are arriving from an orange region?
The government has agreed that the requirement for those arriving from orange locations to restrict their movements can be waived if they have a negative Covid-19 PCR test result up to three days before arrival.
Transport Minister Eamon Ryan has said that passengers will need to get the test of their “own volition”, stating that if they do not have a negative test, they will be asked to adhere to the advice of restricting their movements for 14 days following arrival.
And red countries?
The current requirement to restrict movement for 14 days following arrival from a red region remains but the government agrees that, as soon as practicable, this can be waived following a negative result from an approved PCR Covid-19 test taken five days after arrival, with travellers restricting movements until then.
Testing requirements for arrivals from red countries will be in place “in a matter of weeks”, according to Ryan.
What about children, do they have to be tested?
Children under 6 are to be exempt from testing requirements.
So what regions are currently green, orange and red?
The new ECDC map was published on Thursday, and will apply when the traffic light system kicks in for Ireland on Sunday. Regions currently listed as orange include Norway, Finland, and areas in Greece.
Most other areas are currently red.
What is the government’s advice on all this?
The Department of Foreign Affairs, which sets government policy on travel, states that Ireland is implementing the new traffic light approach to travel, which applies to countries in the EU and UK.
If you are considering travelling outside of Ireland, the Department of Foreign Affairs says it continues to advise against non-essential travel overseas, other than to countries that are part of the EU ‘traffic lights’ approach, where the advice is to exercise a high degree of caution (this includes Great Britain but not Northern Ireland). 
What about pre-departure testing at Irish airports? 
In terms of a testing regime in Ireland, transport minister Eamon Ryan has said the government wants to make sure that such a system does not impede on HSE capacity.
#OPEN JOURNALISM No news is bad news Support The Journal Your contributions will help us continue to deliver the stories that are important to you
SUPPORT US NOW
This week he told an Oireachtas committee that he is confident such a testing regime could be “done quite quickly”.
He said the government has been engaging with the DAA which has engaged with about 20 providers that can supply Covid-19 tests.
Ryan said he expects the private sector to provide the tests. Testing does not necessarily have to take place at their airports, he said, adding that there are considerations that it could take place elsewhere or that people could get their test prior to departure from a private operator. 
What does NPHET think about it all?
Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan has said international travel remains unsafe. 
If testing of incoming passengers is introduced here, the “most efficient” method to manage viral importation is to have a 5-7 day period of restricted movement with a symptom check and Covid-19 test on Day 5 after arrival, he said. 
“This approach can still miss up to 15% of the imported cases. I understand that Finland and Germany are among the countries that have signalled intentions to adopt this measure as part of their travel policies,” Holohan said this week.
However, government only appear to be adopting this approach for red region areas as of now. Ryan said this week that while they will engage with NPHET on the implentation of the traffic light system, and welcome its advice, it is the government that will be making the decisions around travel, not NPHET.
This plan relates to travel within Europe, what about the US?
In terms of travel between the EU and the US, the EU’s new protocol for rapid testing due shortly should give a harmonised approach to testing relating to travel.
Director for Aviation in the European Commission, Filip Cornelis, told the Oireachtas Transport Committee recently that while such measures will be rolled out in Europe first, he could see the scope of working with other countries that adopt similar protocols.
He said the US would be an “obvious candidate” but said there it is “still a little bit too early to take those steps as far as we are concerned”. ","It’s hoped the plan will help jump start the aviation sector in a safe way.",35,0,2,120365,"Nov 7th 2020, 12:05 AM"

“With a margin that small, there will be a recount in Georgia,” Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger told reporters in Atlanta.
Raffensperger, the top elected official overseeing elections, said that the presidential contest in the state “remains too close to call”.
Almost complete results as of this morning showed Biden leading by just over 1,500 votes in Georgia, where changing demographics and strong turnout from African-Americans have put in play a Southern state once seen as reliably backing Trump’s Republicans.
Georgia is equally critical as it is the only state holding elections for both its Senate seats this year, meaning it will determine which party is in control.
Under Georgia’s system, Senate races go to a runoff if no candidate receives 50% in the first round.
“The final tally in Georgia at this point has huge implications for the entire country,” Raffensperger said.
“The stakes are high and emotions are high on all sides. We will not let those debates distract us from our work. We’ll get it right and we’ll defend the integrity of our elections.”

Marge Vs The Monorail: An Oral History
It’s a classic Simpsons episode. 
With its grand scale, silly asides and abundance of absurdist humour, Marge Vs The Monorail represented a stark departure from the show’s established formula.
And while initial reactions were mixed, it’s now widely regarded as one of the show’s finest. 
This oral history from Vice take us through the origins of the episode and speaks to writers and showrunners from back in the day. 
“Every single word of the monorail song was unchanged from Conan’s first draft, which is impressive. My niche on the show in those days was to actually write the tunes to the songs. I wrote a bunch of songs, so I was assigned to set the monorail song to music. It’s sort of like, “Bum, bum, bum, bum. I think I’m done!”
It’s barely a song. It’s just sort of a rhythm and “Monorail! Monorail! Monorail!” The notion that Conan and I co-wrote that song is laughable.

SINN FÉIN HAS tabled a motion of no confidence in Leo Varadkar following controversy over the Tánaiste giving a copy of an agreement between the government and the Irish Medical Organisation to a rival GP group last year. 
The motion will be debated in the Dáil next Tuesday. 
In a statement this afternoon, Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald said this is “the right thing to do and it is the necessary thing to do”. 
Varadkar faced pressure following the news which broke in the Village Magazine last weekend.
Yesterday, Sinn Féin accused the Tánaiste of throwing Dr Maitiú Ó Tuathail, with whom he shared the document, “under the bus”. 
The issue of sharing the agreement was raised again by Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty during Leaders’ Questions yesterday. 
Mary Lou McDonald said: “The Taoiseach Micheál Martin has decided to take no action. The Opposition cannot sit idly by, so we have acted.”
She said this is “more of the old Fine Gael behaviour where it is about who you know and insiders getting access to the corridors of power”. 
A Sinn Féin spokesperson said earlier: “We took the decision due to the seriousness of this situation and the fact that the Tánaiste has faced no sanction nor has he given a credible account for his actions in providing confidential information to a friend.” 
This motion will allow the Dáil to say to the people that no one is above being held to account and that there are consequences when you act as Leo Vardakar has done.  
Commenting on this motion, a spokesman for the Tánaiste said Varadkar “dealt with all the issues in the Dáil this week”.
“This motion clearly shows that Sinn Féin isn’t interested in the truth. They’re only interested in political mudslinging attacking the Irish government at a time of national crisis and diverting attention from the unanswered questions about their receipt of public money in the North.”
Several party officials stepped down from Sinn Féin over a failure to return 
£10,000 payments from an emergency Covid-19 fund. 
In the event of a motion of no confidence, members of government parties are expected to vote with the government and the whip will apply.  
Earlier this week, Fianna Fáil TD Jim O’Callaghan outlined inconsistencies in Varadkar’s statement on the controversy, but said Varadkar’s resignation as Tánaiste and Business Minister would be “bad for the country”. 
#OPEN JOURNALISM No news is bad news Support The Journal Your contributions will help us continue to deliver the stories that are important to you
SUPPORT US NOW
Today, O’Callaghan indicated that he will vote in line with the government on the no-confidence motion. Fianna Fáil’s Marc MacSharry said that “presumably the party will consider the matter next week”.  
MacSharry recently said he was “beyond disgust and depression at issues of the last number of days”, telling the Taoiseach Micheál Martin that there was “palpable anger throughout the country” from party members to see Martin out “as chief flag flyer for Leo”. 
The Sligo TD accused Martin of dragging the party down to 11% in the polls, stating “you need to accept you are part of the problem. Not the solution. At the moment you are the problem. I am disgusted with your conduct”.
Chair of the Fine Gael parliamentary party Richard Bruton said it is “incredible” that Sinn Féin would “waste time engaging in narrow tribal politics on a motion that seeks to bring down the government”. 
“An Tánaiste Leo Varadkar comprehensively answered all of the questions put to him in the debate on Tuesday and apologised for the manner in which he sent the document,” Bruton said in a statement.

The Late Late Show, RTÉ One, tonight, 9.35 pm  
Tonight’s Late Late Show is dedicated to Irish companies who will be showcasing their wares and chatting about the tough times they’re experiencing.
But don’t worry there are still well-known guests if that’s why you’re here.  
Singer Niall Horan will speak to Ryan about how the music industry has been affected by Covid shutdowns and what measures are being taken to keep it afloat. 
Deirdre O’Kane will be discussing the changes in the comedy scene, the new challenges she and other Irish entertainers are facing, as well as her new show (more on that below). 
Diarmuid Gavin, Anna Geary, Kevin Dundon, and Roisin Murphy will also be on to showcase some of their favourite businesses from the worlds of outdoor and gardening, sports and fitness, food and beverages, and homeware.
Ryan says tonight will be a “nod of respect” to local businesses around the country, and a chance to encourage viewers to buy Irish “and keep our friends and neighbours in business”.

Locked down or not, the show goes on. Among the guests joining Graham tonight are Nicole Kidman, British boxing champion Nicola Adams, comedian Jason Manford, and actors Josh O’Connor and Emma Corrin who are playing Charles and Diana in the new series of The Crown.
Tonight’s musical guest is Kylie Minogue, performing her new single .

You can probably take a good guess at what has dominated the late-night scene in America this week.
None of the hosts are taking Trump’s reaction to the US elections results lying down – Stephen Colbert had to do it standing up. 
His monologue dissects Trump’s “sad and frightening” remarks in the White House briefing room last night.

Likewise, Jimmy Kimmel accused Trump of lying and tearing down American democracy and shared his views on the possibility of Trump running again in 2024. 
For the week that’s in it, Kimmel also some well-known names from the world of US politics to read some of the worst things ever written about them. And yes, some of them do come from @realdonaldtrump.

On Last Week Tonight, John Oliver used his last show before the election to look at bagpipe playing US Attorney General William Barr. Oliver discusses Barr’s attitude toward authority and executive power, how that attitude has influenced Donald Trump’s presidency, and what it could mean if Trump wins a second term (unlikely now).
Trevor Noah sent out Daily Show reporter Jordan Klepper to find out how New Yorkers were feeling on election day and what they’re doing to avoid jinxing the results.

On a lighter note, Seth Meyers answered some hard-hitting questions from comedian John Mulaney, like how Colin Jost and Scarlett Johansson’s wedding was and if he thinks he is good looking.
Meyers also had Tracy Chapman on for a timely performance of Talkin’ Bout a Revolution.

There has been a lot of love on Twitter for CNN’s John King and his ‘magic wall’ this election results week. 
King has been providing non-stop analysis of results with the help of his touch screens that filter vote counts by the state and county levels, picking him up plenty of fans along the way. 
Here he is in 2014 talking about how the magic wall’s first purpose was for military and intelligence use, and how he’ll never become a creature of Washington.

The actor said he plans to appeal against the ruling which earlier this week concluded that he assaulted ex-wife Amber Heard.
The 57-year-old sued The Sun’s publisher, News Group Newspapers (NGN), over a 2018 article which labelled him a “wife-beater”.
Depp wrote on Instagram: “My resolve remains strong and I intend to prove that the allegations against me are false.
“My life and career will not be defined by this moment in time.”
He added: “The surreal judgement of the court in the UK will not change my fight to tell the truth and I confirm that I plan to appeal.”
Depp said he had been “asked to resign by Warner Bros. from my role as Grindelwald in Fantastic Beasts and I have respected that and agreed to that request”.
He added he would like to thank “everybody who has gifted me with their support and loyalty”.
“I have been humbled and moved by your many messages of love and concern, particularly over the last few days,” he added.
A statement from Warner Bros said: “Johnny Depp will depart the Fantastic Beasts franchise.
“We thank Johnny for his work on the films to date.

The film is due for release in 2022.
Depp brought legal action against NGN over a column by The Sun’s executive editor Dan Wootton in 2018, which referred to “overwhelming evidence” that the actor attacked Ms Heard, 34, during their relationship.
Wootton asked how Harry Potter author JK Rowling could be “genuinely happy” that Depp had been cast in the latest film in the Fantastic Beasts spin-off franchise amid the allegations by Ms Heard.
In a ruling on Monday, Justice Nicol dismissed the Pirates Of The Caribbean star’s claim, saying NGN had proved what was in the article to be “substantially true”.","Warner Bros. said his part would be recast.",1,0,0,42527,"Nov 6th 2020, 6:18 PM"
1085,193,"Former astronaut takes Senate seat previously held by John McCain",https://www.thejournal.ie/mark-kelly-us-senate-5258219-Nov2020/,"RETIRED SPACE SHUTTLE commander Mark Kelly has won a US Senate seat in Arizona, defeating a Republican incumbent who succeeded John McCain.
Before his win was confirmed, Democrat Kelly (56) told supporters he was “confident that when the votes are counted, that we’re going to be successful in this mission”.
Kelly is the husband of former Democratic Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who survived being shot in the head in an assassination attempt during a constituent event in Tucson in 2011.
The former astronaut saw off a challenge from Senator Martha McSally, a trailblazing former fighter pilot.
McSally was aligned with President Donald Trump earlier this year but distanced herself from him in recent weeks in the southwestern state, where changing demographics and moderate conservatives’ frustrations with Trump helped Democrat Joe Biden win the state in the presidential race.
“The work starts now. And we desperately need Washington to work for Arizona,” Kelly told a small group of family and reporters gathered for his victory speech in Tucson.
“My top priority is making sure we have a plan to slow the spread of this virus, and then getting Arizona the resources our state needs right now.”

There were 35 of the Senate’s 100 seats up for election on Tuesday. Senators serve six-year terms and a third of the seats are up for reelection every two years.
Republicans held a 53-47 Senate majority prior to the election. As things stand, with 31 of 35 races called, the Republicans have 48 seats to the Democrats’ 46, while independents have two seats (51 is needed for a majority).
To date, Democrats have 210 seats to the Republicans’ 194; 218 seats are needed for a majority in the 435-member House. Members serve two-year terms.
Biden nearing victory
Democrat Joe Biden is on the brink of winning the White House after taking the lead in the potentially decisive state of Pennsylvania but Trump is showing no signs of being ready to concede and his campaign insisted the bitterly contested race is “not over”.
Pennsylvania, and its 20 electoral votes, would be enough to vault the 77-year-old Biden past the magic number of 270 votes in the Electoral College, which determines the presidency.

When can we expect to get results in remaining states?
With tens of thousands of votes remaining to be counted in Pennsylvania, many from heavily Democratic areas, Biden opened up a 9,000-vote lead over the Republican incumbent, according to real-time state election results.
Biden currently has at least 253 electoral votes and is leading in three other states — Arizona, Georgia and Nevada — where ballots from Tuesday’s bitterly contested election continue to be counted.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, welcomed what she called the “strong mandate” given to “President-elect Biden”. It is “a happy day for our country. Joe Biden is a unifier, because he is determined to bring people together,” Pelosi said.
While his reelection hopes may be fading, Trump is making it clear that he is not ready to accept defeat, launching unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud during an extraordinary White House appearance yesterday and claiming that he had actually won.
“This election is not over,” the Trump campaign’s general counsel Matt Morgan said after news of Biden’s lead in Pennsylvania broke.
“The false projection of Joe Biden as the winner is based on results in four states that are far from final,” Morgan said in a statement.
“Biden is relying on these states for his phony claim on the White House, but once the election is final, President Trump will be re-elected.”
Morgan alleged there had been “improperly cast” ballots in Georgia, where a recount is expected, and Nevada and claimed Republican vote-counting observers had been denied access in Pennsylvania.

The Biden campaign fired back at the Trump campaign’s refusal to admit defeat with a statement tinged with sarcasm.
“As we said on July 19th, the American people will decide this election,” it said. “And the United States government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House.”

1087,234,"Judge orders arrest of persons occupying controversial repossessed farm",https://www.thejournal.ie/strokestown-high-court-order-farm-eviction-5258200-Nov2020/,"A HIGH COURT judge has ordered the arrest of any person found in occupation of a Roscommon farm, which was the scene of a controversial eviction in 2018.
The orders were made by Ms Justice Leonie Reynolds against three named individuals, and any other person found to be in occupation of the property at Falsk, Strokestown in Co Roscommon.
She said she was satisfied to order the arrest of Michael Anthony McGann, who owns the property, former Garda Kevin Taylor of Dublin Road, Longford and Colm Granahan from Ballina, Co Mayo.
The court heard evidence from KBC, which previously obtained an injunction granting it vacant possession of the farm, that the three remain on the property.
The judge said it was clear that individuals were engaged in “a consorted effort to undermine an order of the High Court”.
The three individuals, along with any other person found in occupation, are to be brought before the court by the gardaí to answer their alleged contempt, the judge directed.
She said she was making the orders “with regret” but the court had to “bring some finality” to the long-running action.
The judge said orders of the court must be complied with. The Gardai could use all reasonable force necessary to enforce the court’s order, she added.
The farm has been the subject of proceedings involving siblings Michael Anthony, David, and Geraldine McGann, and KBC Bank, which secured orders allowing it repossess the property.
Last month, the siblings were brought before the court, following their arrest by gardaí, to answer claims that they were in contempt of an order directing them to leave the property.
The three were released after they gave undertakings to leave their home, and remove their livestock from the farm.
However, KBC returned to court claiming it was unable to secure possession of the property due to the presence of several individuals on the farm.
Today, Rossa Fanning SC for KBC said Mr Michael Anthony McGann, Mr Taylor, Mr Granahan and others were on the property.
He said a tractor had been parked in the front entrance to the property. A gate had also been padlocked, counsel said.
Counsel said that despite previously giving an undertaking not to return to the farm Michael Anthony McGann had gone back, and had said in a video posted on social media that he would “not be abandoning the property,”
Fanning said all those on the property were “well aware” of the High Court order directing all persons to vacate the farm.
He added that his client had a “whack a mole” problem regarding who was on the property at any given time.
As well as the three named individuals, persons appeared to be coming and going from the farm, he said.
KBC said it required an order allowing Gardai arrest any person found in occupation of the property.
Counsel said there was no evidence that either David or Geraldine McGann had breached their undertakings and the contempt proceedings against them could be adjourned.

There was no appearance in court by any of the McGanns, nor by any of the individuals alleged to be in occupation of the property.
KBC Bank obtained an order for possession of the farm several years ago arising out of a €431,000 debt on the property from a loan to its registered owner Michael Anthony McGann.
The McGanns were evicted in 2018 but the house was later the scene of an attack on security men employed to secure it.
The security men were forced off the property by a group of masked men and a number of vehicles were burnt.
The McGanns, who were not involved in the incidents, returned to the house.
KBC sought to have them jailed for contempt of court by failing to vacate after they failed to comply with an order made in March to vacate the farm.
Matters were put on hold due to Covid19. Last month, the three McGanns were brought before the court over their alleged contempt, before being released.
The matter will return before the court at a later date.","The judge said it was clear that individuals were engaged in “a consorted effort to undermine an order of the High Court”.",3,0,0,37565,"Nov 6th 2020, 5:13 PM"

1090,212,"'The day I don’t feel threatened, I’ll know it’s time for me to hang up the boots'",https://www.the42.ie/johnny-sexton-ireland-captain-7-5256656-Nov2020/,"IT SEEMS LIKELY that Andy Farrell won’t have to deal with another situation like the one presented to him by Johnny Sexton’s reaction upon being replaced last weekend.
Unless it’s by Sexton himself again.
“It’s not the first time, is it?” Farrell pointed out yesterday.
There simply isn’t another Irish rugby player like Sexton.
He belongs in an elite category as the only Irishman aside from Keith Wood to have won the World Rugby Player of the Year award, although Brian O’Driscoll should have received the honour in 2009.
As well as his ability, Sexton’s character is unique. They’re all serious competitors in professional rugby and none of us on the outside probably quite understand what goes into thriving or even just surviving at the top level of what is a brutally physical sport.
But Sexton has that little more edge, that little more ferocity in his desire to win, a sheer need to be successful that can spill out in an unedifying manner at times. 
When it’s channeled in the right way, Sexton’s personality is a driving force and a benchmark for those around him. But what makes Sexton the great player he has been can also be a major weakness – as it was last weekend.
To many people, his reaction was unacceptable from a captain but, publicly at least, Ireland boss Farrell has been happy to accept it. Sexton confirmed yesterday that he apologised to his head coach the day after the game in Paris, although Farrell was unwilling to go into detail.
“That will stay between me and Johnny, we’ve got a good relationship and a respectful one,” said Farrell. “Respectful is the word right at the top of that relationship. I’m more than happy with how things are going.”
Farrell certainly wasn’t willing to rebuke the 35-year-old as he looked to stress the quality of their coach-captain relationship, but one does wonder what might have happened if it was another player who had reacted in the manner Sexton did.
Sexton was replaced by Ross Byrne in Paris.

Would the Ireland head coach be willing to accept a less-established player so publicly questioning his decision?
“You’ve got to understand the person, everyone is different within this group, you know?” said Farrell when that was put to him.
“It’s his personality, it’s what gives him that winning edge. Of course, there’s always learning to go with that but everyone is different and you treat people differently as well.”
One could easily read that as ‘one rule for Johnny, one for the rest.’ It would be intriguing to get honest opinions from his Ireland team-mates about the incident, but Sexton himself said all is well on that front.

“I spoke to a few guys over the last couple of days, I don’t think it is a big deal,” said Sexton. “I have asked others to ask them as well, they don’t think it is a big deal.
“They’d probably not say that to my face anyway in terms of it is not a big deal if it was, so, look, I think it is a storm in a teacup. It was a split-second thing, it didn’t carry over into the dressing room after, it didn’t carry into the team get-together that night.
“It was just one of those things you wish you could take back but, unfortunately, you can’t and you live and learn.”
Of course, behind the issue of Sexton’s reaction is the fact that he was being replaced at all, with Ireland back to within eight points of the French and chasing what admittedly still looked like an unlikely comeback win.
In Sexton’s ceaselessly competitive mind, he was still capable of pulling something out of the fire for Ireland and he clearly couldn’t understand why Farrell was calling him ashore.
Sexton certainly hadn’t been error-free but his replacement, Ross Byrne, had a tough 12 minutes after coming on and it still seems clear that Sexton is Ireland’s best out-half by a distance.
Farrell and Sexton stressed they're keen to move on.
Source: Dan Sheridan/INPHO
Farrell has been spoken several times of the need to have competition for places in his Ireland squad but with Joey Carbery remaining sidelined indefinitely, there isn’t huge pressure on Sexton for his place.
Farrell has brought Billy Burns back into his squad in place of Jack Carty to offer another option at out-half, while the Ireland boss feels 21-year-old Leinster out-half Harry Byrne is better off playing regular Pro14 rugby for the time being.
Sexton himself disagrees with the notion that there is no competition for his place.
“Everyone feels pressure, everyone feels competition – you are playing, training, you have reps, it’s competitive, in games in training it’s competitive,” said Sexton.
“I think the day that comes out of me is the day I’ll pack it in and that’s my honest answer. If I don’t feel threatened, I’ll know that it’s time for me to hang up the boots because I have always felt like that.
“At times I probably shouldn’t have been threatened but it’s the way I deal with threats, it’s the way I’m wired and even looking at the younger guys coming through who aren’t even in the squad I’m always looking at them, not worrying about them, just making sure they are still driving me and that’s the same.”

ADAM MULDOON WAS “the light in any room” his sister said today in a powerful statement to the Central Criminal Court in which she pointed out that the man who stabbed her brother 183 times has shown no remorse for the “gruesome” murder.
In a second victim impact statement, Adam’s father Michael Bolger wrote that the family “can’t understand how anyone could be so callous and brutal to inflict such a death on such a sweet and innocent person.”
Philip Dunbar (20) was today sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of 23-year-old Adam ‘Floater’ Muldoon at Butler Park, Jobstown Park, Tallaght on 22 or 23 June 2018.
Dunbar stabbed Adam Muldoon 183 times in an unprovoked attack with a fold-up knife and then went to a friend’s house where he boasted that he had “slaughtered Floater” and “put him out of his misery” as he “begged for his life”. He was found guilty of murder by a unanimous jury verdict at the Central Criminal Court earlier this week.
Adam Muldoon’s younger sister Katie delivered a powerful statement to the Central Criminal Court today saying that Adam had struggled from birth having been diagnosed with cerebral palsy.
He struggled to fit in, his sister said, and despite facing obstacles throughout his life, particularly following his mother’s death, he kept fighting. “He was the light in any room,” she said.
When Adam and Katie’s mother died, Katie said the family became separated and Adam moved to Tallaght where other teenagers would take advantage of him. But he “overcame every challenge independently”, she said, and would “have a giggle with anybody. He really wouldn’t hurt a fly.”
The day he was murdered, she said, her life crashed. On the day she was supposed to be celebrating her 16th birthday her family held a wake for her brother. She felt powerless and “everything has been downhill from there”.
“My heart aches,” she said, as she thinks of Adam’s final moments and the fear he must have felt. She imagines her brother crying for her help.
“Hearing how he begged for his life haunts me,” she said. At times she couldn’t even say her brother’s name as it would cause her to have a panic attack. She said that her physical and mental health began to suffer, adding: “There was no good left in the world. Everything was just dark.”
She said her brother didn’t deserve such a “gruesome” death and said the family had to endure a trial because Dunbar pleaded not guilty and then continued to lie. She added: “His lack of emotion shows he has no remorse for what he has done.”
She thanked the people of Tallaght who had given evidence that helped secure Dunbar’s conviction.

A second statement was written by Adam’s father Michael Bolger and read to the court by Det Garda Nuala Burke. He said the family was “devastated ” by his death and “can’t understand how anyone could be so callous and brutal to inflict such a death on such a sweet and innocent person.”
He said that Dunbar had caused “unimaginable despair, grief and heartache.”
Det Garda Burke also told the court that Dunbar has a number of previous convictions under the Theft Act, for possession of drugs and for Road Traffic Act violations.
Mr Justice Paul McDermott said the deceased’s life and the challenges he faced had been brought to the forefront by the “eloquent” statements made by his family. He sentenced Dunbar to life imprisonment backdated to 24 June 2018 when he first went into custody.
Counsel for Dunbar, Giollaiosa O’Lideadha SC indicated that his client intends to appeal the murder verdict.
Outside court Superintendent Ian Lackey said the family and friends of Adam Muldoon had been suffering since Adam’s “senseless murder”. He said he hopes the verdict and sentence handed down will offer them some comfort.
He also thanked the people of Jobstown who helped Adam during his life and who also came forward to provide the evidence that convicted his murderer.

Israel’s army demolished the homes of nearly 80 Palestinian Bedouins in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday. Israeli bulldozers razed the village — including tents, sheds, portable toilets and solar panels — near Tubas in the Jordan Valley.
Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh accused Israeli troops of having “completely demolished the village of Homsa al-Baqia, leaving around 80 people homeless”.
The branch of Israel’s army responsible for civilian affairs in the West Bank, COGAT, said it had destroyed structures “built illegally in a firing zone (military training area) in the Jordan Valley”.
The Jordan Valley falls in the West Bank’s Area C that is fully controlled by Israel’s army, which has occupied the West Bank since 1967.
Under Israeli rules, Palestinians cannot build structures in the area without permits, which are typically refused, and demolitions are common.
In a statement today, Coveney said: “Destruction of private property such as this is clearly prohibited under international humanitarian law.
“The eviction of families and demolition of their homes is a brutal and violent act. These most vulnerable of people should be protected by the occupation authorities, not subject to further injustice,” he said.

Ireland’s Representative Office in Ramallah visited the site of the demolitions today, the Minister added, along with other diplomatic representatives.
“Ireland, the EU, and the wider humanitarian community are ready to support those impacted. However, I reiterate my call on Israel to cease this practice and live up to its responsibility to protect local communities,” Coveney said. 
This week’s destruction of the Humsa Al Bqai’a community is a further acceleration of confiscations and demolitions this year, despite previous commitments from Israeli authorities not to target Palestinian residential structures during the Covid-19 pandemic.
“It is deeply disappointing that Israel continues to carry out these reprehensible acts which are a grave breach of international humanitarian law,” said Coveney.

The Co Galway-based businessman, who is a practising Roman Catholic claims that as a result of the state implementing what are known as Level 5 restrictions, he cannot leave his home and attend Mass.
He claims the measures, which were introduced last month and may expire on 1 December next, do allow certain religious activities to take place, including weddings and funerals.
However he claims the restrictions do not allow him or any other person who wishes to attend Mass or a similar religious service, which he claims is protected under the constitution.
This he claims is a breach of his constitutional rights to practice his religion. As a result, he has launched judicial review proceedings against the Minister for Health. Ireland and the Attorney General are notice parties to his proceedings.
The matter came before Mr Justice Charles Meenan today who said the proposed challenge related to measures included as part of the government’s Level 5 plan to combat the pandemic.
Those particular measures, he said, may expire on 1 December, which he said may render Ganley’s action moot, or pointless.
The Judge added that there was no likelihood of what is a complex case, if the state respondents choose to challenge it, being heard by the end of the month.
The judge, who directed that the application for permission to bring the challenge be heard on notice to the State, adjourned the matter to 8 December when circumstances can be reassessed.
The judge said he presumed the matter would be opposed by the State. However, it was free to come to court at any time to say that it was not opposing Mr Ganley’s action, the judge added.
In reply, Mr Ganley’s lawyers said the matter was urgent, and argued that similar restrictions regarding attending religious services could be re-imposed in the future.
In his action, Mr Ganley represented by Neil Steen SC, Darren Lehane SC instructed by solicitor Eamonn Cunningham of Gateley Tweed seeks various orders and declarations from the court.
These include an order that certain temporary regulations introduced as part of the government’s efforts to deal with the pandemic, namely Regulation 5(1) and (3) of the 1947 Health Act, are quashed.
He also seeks declarations from the court that the regulations challenged are incompatible with various articles, including Article 44 where the State acknowledges the right of persons to freely practise their religion, of the Constitution of Ireland.

In the alternative, a declaration that the regulations challenged does not prevent him from leaving his residence for the purpose of practising his religion, including participation in public worship. 
Mr Steen said the issue was extremely important for his client. It was accepted that the vast majority of religious services, including Catholic masses, have been cancelled by church leaders due to the pandemic.
The regulations, he said did not appear to prevent services like Masses, Catholic Priests cannot leave their homes to perform a mass nor can persons like Mr Ganley attend such services.
Counsel said that the constitution has express provisions protecting the freedom of religious practice. It is his client’s case that the specific regulations challenged, which were introduced by the Minister for Health, cannot interfere with those rights.
Counsel said that while it was accepted that the restrictions challenged might well be lifted by 1 December there was a concern that the restrictions could be re-imposed by the Government.
Counsel added that the case ultimately raised a net point and was very different to other challenges brought against government measures in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.

IT SHOULD BE a hectic week for Declan Hughes.
Fielding ticket queries for Connacht championship games, digesting the action watched in Carrick-on-Shannon last weekend and laying down the plans for the trip to Roscommon on Sunday.
In their pocket of south Mayo this is a landmark time.
Tommy Conroy made his provincial senior bow last Sunday, the first time that The Neale enjoyed such representation with Mayo seniors on championship day in over three decades. 
Hughes is club chairman and while there is a buoyancy to the local mood this week, it is tempered by the restrictions that will keep them all at home on Sunday instead of passing through the turnstiles at Dr Hyde Park.
“It’s strange. The whole lockdown thing makes it hard, you don’t even see him (Tommy) around the place. You can’t travel to games to support him. His parents, club supporters and underage kids would be travelling to Roscommon in other times. It’s a great club for supporting that type of thing.
“If it was summertime with a Connacht semi-final, Cong would normally be a very busy little village with tourists and that, he would see a lot of people around then. Then he’d be in the ground training with the senior team, the underage might be training before but there’s none of that meeting and greeting. There’s nobody up there, the gate is locked.”
It’s odd for them to reflect on where they were 12 months ago, locked in club combat and on the Connacht title trail. A historic intermediate success in Mayo was achieved in October 2019 for their club hard on the Galway border and the edge of Lough Corrib. A few miles further north is Lough Mask. The club draws from a pool consisting of three villages – Cong, Cross and The Neale. Their grounds are just over the wall from Ashford Castle.
When that provincial honour was on offer, they were pitted against neighbours over the water in Galway’s Oughterard, who bettered them that night in Castlebar by eight points and subsequently lifted the All-Ireland last January.
Confined indoors in this Covid-dominated winter, the progression of one of their own has generated some joy and spiked interest in football.
It has been helped by the strong goalscoring mood Conroy has been in of late, putting shots in the net against Tyrone and Leitrim the past two Sunday afternoons. He also took the Tyrone defence for three points and matched that tally the week before in a thumping win over Galway.
Inter-county championship recognition is cherished even if it is occurring behind closed doors in the depths of winter.
“I only mentioned it the other night when I was doing the Lotto live online from the clubhouse myself,” says Hughes.
“It was 1988, the last one to play championship out of the club was Eddie Gibbons, he came on as a sub (against Leitrim). It was Sean Luskin before that, (the last player from The Neale to start for Mayo seniors in 1983 against Roscommon).
“It’s a long time in the history of the club to be waiting for somebody else to come along. We had lads who played league football for Mayo since and underage but championship, no.”
Conroy’s progression was well-flagged as he reached all the various staging posts. In 2017 he kicked 0-4 from play in Croke Park as Ballinrobe CS claimed an All-Ireland title. Oisin Mullin, who also enjoyed a maiden start for Mayo last Sunday, was on that schools team with Darragh Canavan part of the opposing Tyrone ranks with St Ciaran’s Ballygawley.
If his minor campaign was short-lived in Mayo that year as they were convincingly beaten by Galway, then 2018 brought a journey with U20 side that went all the way to an All-Ireland final. They lost out there to Kildare but Conroy had nailed the two insurance points that clinched the semi-final win over Derry.

Other displays jumped out last year, 2-1 as the NUIG Freshers won an All-Ireland final in March and 0-3 as captain in July in a Connacht U20 final defeat. Recruitment from James Horan followed as he shook up his senior squad. January saw Conroy taste league football for the first time, hitting a point when introduced against Donegal. He was brought on for the Dublin, Monaghan and Kerry games, started against Meath and raised a single white flag in three of those appearances.

“He would always have been seen as a classy player,” says Hughes.
“A great eye for goal always and he was blessed with pace. His personality, he’s in college in Galway, works locally there in O’Connor’s Spar in Cong, he’s just like anyone else when you go in the door, a quiet lad, great mannered.
“He trains hard, you’d always see him doing extra. He’d know where he wants to improve, disciplined across the board. All the young lads look up at him.
“This year we’d our underage presentation in February and we’d Aidan O’Shea up to do it along with Tommy. Aidan O’Shea said that day it won’t be too long before Tommy will be down in Breaffy giving out the presentation for the kids down there.
“He carries himself and is a great ambassador for The Neale GAA.”

Conroy’s rise has mirrored that of his club. Lavelles were the original local team in Cong before the three villages merged to form The Neale club in 1944. Days of glory were thin on the ground for a long time but the last decade has brought the breakthroughs they long dreamed of.
John Morrin, now the Claregalway chairman, took over the team around 2000 and laid the foundations with better coaching and enhanced their levels of preparation.
The first adult title arrived at last in 2012, a goal from an injury-time free drew them level in the junior final against Ardnaree and they completed their task in extra-time.

Last October delivered that intermediate triumph over a Ballyhaunis team anchored by Keith Higgins. They didn’t add on the Connacht accolade but in the delayed 2020 season they made strides in a historic first attempt at the senior grade, escaping from the group stages and acquitting themselves well in a quarter-final loss to Westport.
Hughes was a selector in 2012, his brother Eoin the manager over the last few years. These are heady times for them.
“We’ve a project going on, we’re putting in an all-weather pitch. We’d a Mayor of the Parish fundraising campaign last year, it ran for six months, the three candidates from the different villages, they raised €164,000 between them. We need a second pitch with the numbers we have, there’s a lot of teams between ladies and mens from underage up. The club is going on in big steps, we’re putting a lot into it.”
Conroy’s climb to the Mayo senior ranks has brought them wider recognition. He has illustrated his worth to the club – the 2019 county intermediate final yielding a man-of-the-match award, firing 2-4 from play as he torched Sligo’s Geevagh in Connacht, a rampant early showing in that senior last eight game in August before Lee Keegan was sent back to stifle his influence.

Conroy’s presence imbues a sense of pride in a football community used to seeing those around them send players up to commit for the Mayo county cause.
“We were long enough looking at other clubs,” says Hughes.
“You’d be looking at Ballinrobe there they’d Donal Vaughan and before that Fergal Costello. You’d the Mortimers over the road in Shrule and Pat Kelly in Kilmaine. Enda Varley in Garrymore. You’d the Coens and a few more boys and the Connellys down in Hollymount.
“We were always looking over at these lads. We were junior as well trying to get up. Now we’re gone senior, we’ve a fabulous facility in Cong and we’ve Tommy on the Mayo seniors. I’m not boasting but it’s great to be there.”

Hughes’ own son Ronan featured for the Mayo minors in an All-Ireland semi-final against Cork last August. The 17-year-old set up his own sportswear business called Hughsey Sports and will appear on The Late Late Show tonight as RTÉ shines a light on small businesses in Ireland. He’s part of the current Mayo minor squad as well with Ronan Varley while another The Neale player Fergal Sweeney was a member of the U20s last spring.
That’s the weekend warm up act on TV, on Sunday all eyes will be trained on Roscommon with a Connacht final place at stake.
Hughes works in McGrath’s Quarry in Cong where there is a sizeable Galway contingent in the workforce. With Galway already in the decider, it could be a lively Connacht final build-up next week with a local forward involved if Sunday’s result goes to their liking.
“People are excited, I know they are. Everybody’s rooting for him. People are putting up messages. It’s great to see him playing and scoring.
“It’s a pity we can’t be there but it’ll come around again and Tommy will hopefully be playing for Mayo for years to come.”

1096,182,"When can we expect to get results in remaining states?",https://www.thejournal.ie/us-election-final-results-5257598-Nov2020/,"DEMOCRAT JOE BIDEN is now leading Donald Trump in the battleground state of Georgia as we draw closer to a result in the US presidential election
Victory in Georgia, which holds 16 electoral college votes, would take Biden over the 270 threshold of votes needed to win the White House.
However, with 99% of votes counted, Biden is currently just over 1,000 votes ahead of Trump in the state so it’s still too close to call.
If Trump loses Georgia, which has long been a Republican stronghold, he cannot win a majority of electoral college seats.
If the result is tight, a recount is likely.
Counting is also continuing in a number of other states.
In Arizona and Nevada, Biden is holding on to slim leads. If the Democrat wins two of those three states he would win the presidency.
The biggest piece of the puzzle is Pennsylvania, where Trump’s early lead is steadily draining away.
Biden currently is projected to have 253 of the 538 electoral college votes.
He has 264 with the inclusion of Arizona, which the Associated Press and, much to the president’s anger, Fox News have called in his favour but other major organisations have not.
As well as preemptively announcing victory in states where the results were not final, Trump said he planned to contest the election before the Supreme Court. It was unclear what legal action he might pursue as he has been unable to back up claims of fraud and voter suppression.
On Wednesday, Trump’s campaign filed lawsuits in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia, and said it would request a recount in Wisconsin.
Judges have denied or dismissed the lawsuits in Georgia and Michigan.
The Trump campaign filed a number of legal motions in Pennsylvania, including attempts to stop the vote count and allow Republican Party members observe the vote count.
Pennsylvania
In Pennsylvania Trump’s lead has dropped to about 18,000 votes. Biden is expected to take a sizeable number of postal votes across the state. An updated count is expected in the next hour or two.
If Biden took Pennsylvania, he would grab 20 more electoral college votes, thereby instantly topping the necessary 270 for overall victory.
The latest results show Trump’s lead in the state had shrunk to around 18,000 votes, with most ballots yet to be counted coming from Democratic stronghold Philadelphia. At least 293,000 ballots have yet to be counted.
We may get results in Pennsylvania late tonight, but it could run into tomorrow.

Mail ballots from across the state overwhelmingly broke in Biden’s direction.
There’s also a possibility the race here won’t be decided for days. If there is less than a half percentage point difference between Biden and Trump’s vote total, state law dictates that a recount must be held.
The count in Philadelphia was temporarily halted as officials rearranged part of the room where tabulation was taking place, resuming after what the city’s bipartisan board of elected officials said was a “brief pause”, as reported by NBC News.
Justin Clark, Trump’s deputy campaign manager and senior counsel, claimed the campaign had been denied access to count rooms in Philadelphia.
“This ruling [on Thursday] by the appellate court in Pennsylvania, it guarantees we’re going to be able to watch the ballots being counted in a corrupt place that is known for its shenanigans on Election Day and after.”
City officials have petitioned to appeal the ruling to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.
There’s no evidence of voter fraud in Philadelphia or elsewhere, and officials said poll watchers were not denied entry.
Nevada
Biden leads by over 11,000 votes, less than one percentage point, in Nevada, with more than 1.2 million ballots counted and about 190,000 left to go.
The next update on the count will be at about 8pm Irish time, but the count in this state could also take days to finish.

In Arizona Biden’s lead is about 46,000 votes ahead;at least 293,000 ballots have yet to be counted. An update is expected at 4pm Irish time. 
North Carolina
The race is too early to call here.
Trump held a nearly 77,000-vote lead yesterday, but up to 116,000 mail ballots are left to count, as well as about 41,000 provisional ballots statewide.
As long as those ballots are postmarked by 3 November, the state of the election, state officials have until 12 November to count them. And when it comes to mail ballots, Biden is again outperforming Trump.
Alaska
The solidly Republican state of Alaska has also not been called because it is only 50% counted and will not release absentee numbers until 10 November. Results here are not expected to impact the outcome of the election.

With mass limited to taking place online under Levels 3, 4 and 5 of Ireland’s coronavirus measures, the prospect of priests being fined or imprisoned for holding a service has been the focus of comment online, in the media and even in the Dáil chamber in recent weeks.

However, the Department of Health has confirmed to TheJournal.ie that there is no provision for this in the legislation that underpins the restrictions.  
Dáil debate
The topic arose during a 22 October Dáil debate on extending the length of time for which the emergency Covid-19 legislation will be in place.
Independent TD Michael McNamara said that “priests will be committing a criminal offence if they open the doors of their churches for mass”.
“Is the Government going to send gardaí after priests who decide to say mass? If the Government is thinking of that, I have one word to say, ‘Don’t’,” the Clare politician said.
In response, Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said that the government is following the National Public Health Emergency Team’s (NPHET) advice on places of worship. He dismissed McNamara’s comments on penalties saying: “Religious services are non-penal in that there is no penalty attached to them.”
After Donnelly concluded his remarks, McNamara made another contribution calling for the record of the house to be corrected. He argued that because saying mass in public was not deemed a ‘reasonable excuse’ for leaving the home under the restrictions, it could result in priests getting into trouble with the law.
The debate concluded without Donnelly responding to this remark.
Iona Institute
The Health Minister’s comments drew the attention of the Iona Institute which issued a statement with the headline ‘Clergy who hold acts of public worship can go to prison under new Covid measures’.
The statement offered further dissection of Donnelly’s comments in the Dáil, claiming that, under Article 8 of the regulations, the organiser of an event that breaches the restrictions, such as a priest that holds a public mass, can face penalties including a fine, imprisonment or both.
“It seems clear, therefore, that Minister Donnelly is incorrect in his interpretation of the new law, a minister of religion can potentially go to prison for holding a public act of worship,” the Catholic advocacy group said.
Quotes from this press release were published in pieces on conservative websites in various countries. Chunks of the text also appeared in numerous Facebook posts.
Department of Health
The Department of Health and a Covid-19 legal expert have dismissed the group’s claim, clarifying that events held for religious reasons could not result in sanctions.
“There is no penalty attached to religious events because they are not included in the definition of ‘relevant event’ for the purposes of Regulation 8,” the Department of Health said.
Regulation 8 provides for restrictions on the organisation of a ‘relevant event’. A ‘relevant event’ is defined at Regulation 4 as ‘…. an event held, or to be held, for social, recreational, exercise, cultural, entertainment or community reasons…’. A relevant event does not include an event held for religious reasons.
In response to McNamara’s comments, the department explained that the list of ‘reasonable excuses’ for leaving the home is non-exhaustive.

Oran Doyle, Professor in law at the Covid-19 Law and Human Rights Observatory of Trinity College Dublin, told TheJournal.ie that the inclusion of ‘religious’ in Section 31A of the legislation and its exclusion from Regulation 4 implies that religious events are not subject to the prohibition in Regulation 8 that was cited by the Iona Institute.
However, Professor Doyle added that it was “not satisfactory” that the legislation was so unclear.
“‘Event’ is defined by Section 31A, subsection 16 of the parent statute as a gathering of persons, whether the gathering is for cultural, entertainment, recreational, sporting, commercial, work, social, community, educational, religious or other reasons,” he said.

The Iona Institute said it does not find the government’s clarification very reassuring.
“The Government says the list of ‘reasonable excuses’ is not exhaustive. If they think holding public worship is a reasonable excuse then they need to say so clearly,” spokesperson David Quinn said.
The government’s five-level framework for combatting Covid-19 restricts indoor gatherings because of the higher risk associated with these activities. 
Ministers of Religion are permitted to travel to perform a service on-line, to minister to the sick, and conduct a funeral or wedding ceremony at all five levels. Churches and other places of worship can also remain open for private prayer at all the levels.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin met with Catholic archbishops last week to discuss public worship during Covid-19. There was no change to the restrictions following the meeting and all the parties agreed on the importance of ongoing constructive engagement.

With coronavirus cases surging across the country since mid-October, more than 100 million voters cast their ballot by mail or in person before Election Day – the highest number of early voters ever – as many Americans sought to avoid crowded polling booths.
The final election results have been partly delayed by the high number of mail-in ballots, which Trump alleges without evidence are fraudulent.

Shortly after 10pm (3am Irish time), a man was detained outside the Philadelphia Convention Centre where vote counting is ongoing. 
Local television channel 6ABC Action News reports that police received a tip that an armed group had driven from Virginia to Philadelphia, a drive of several hours, to carry out some kind of attack at the count centre. 
The group is possibly a family, the site reports. 
Police have recovered a weapon and seized the Hummer vehicle that the group travelled in. No injuries have been reported.
Pennsylvania is a battleground state which is yet to declare a winner in the presidential election. 
Since election day, US president Donald Trump has fired off tweets calling for ballot counting to be stopped, and contended without proof there has been voter fraud.
But his tweets have been masked by Twitter with notices telling people the claims are misleading.

Although it is the advice, it is currently not mandatory to restrict your movements if you’re identified as a close contact of a confirmed case. 
The current HSE advice says: “If you’re a close contact of a person that tests positive for Covid-19 you must restrict your movements (stay at home) for 14 days. Do this from when you were last in contact with that person.” If your test is negative, you still need to restrict your movements for 14 days or until a date given to you by the HSE.
Yesterday, 591 new cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in Ireland and chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said Level 5 restrictions “have succeeded in reducing community transmission of the disease”. 
He added: “Now is not the time to be complacent. We must keep driving down this disease- we must keep going.”
So, today we’re asking you: Should it be made mandatory for close contacts to have to restrict their movements?

SOME REPUBLICANS ARE breaking with President Donald Trump’s attempts to falsely declare victory in the election and claim without evidence that Democrats are trying to “steal” it from him.
Trump escalated those allegations last night, telling reporters at the White House that the ballot-counting process was unfair and corrupt, having uttered similar allegations late on election night.
The president did not back up his claims with any details or evidence, and state and federal officials have not reported any instances of widespread voter fraud.
Representative Adam Kinzinger, a Republican from Illinois, tweeted that the president’s claims of fraud were “getting insane”. If Trump had “legit” concerns about fraud they needed to be based on evidence and taken to court, Kinzinger said, adding: “STOP Spreading debunked misinformation”.
On Wednesday he had commented more forcefully on Trump’s claim Democrats were trying to “steal” the election, tweeting: “Stop. Full stop.”
“The votes will be counted and you will either win or lose,” Kinzinger told Trump. “And America will accept that. Patience is a virtue.”
Maryland’s Republican governor Larry Hogan, a potential 2024 presidential hopeful who has often criticised Trump, said unequivocally: “There is no defense for the President’s comments tonight undermining our Democratic process. America is counting the votes, and we must respect the results as we always have before.”
Learn more
“No election or person is more important than our Democracy,” Hogan said on Twitter.
However, two of Trump’s senate allies warned that Republicans may reject the legitimacy of vote results if they turn against the embattled president.
As a few Republicans distanced themselves from Trump’s unsubstantiated allegations of fraud in Tuesday’s election, Senators Lindsey Graham and Ted Cruz enthusiastically backed him in back-to-back appearances on Fox News.
“I’ll tell you the president is angry and I’m angry and the voters ought to be angry,” Cruz told the network’s host Sean Hannity, whose evening show is a favorite of Trump.
Cruz alleged falsely that Pennsylvania’s Democratic attorney general had ordered vote-counting in the state’s largest city of Philadelphia “until Joe Biden wins.”
“We need to get in there now,” Cruz said of voting centers.
Asked by Hannity if the Pennsylvania legislature could refuse to recognize the results and instead give the state’s electoral votes to Trump, Graham replied, “I think everything should be on the table.”
“Philadelphia elections are crooked as a snake. Why are they shutting people out? Because they don’t want people to see what they’re doing,” said Graham, who easily won reelection Tuesday in South Carolina despite a major push by Democrats.
Meanwhile, other criticism of Trump, though less direct, came from members of Congress. Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who spoke at a recent Trump campaign rally, said in a tweet that if any candidate believes “a state is violating election laws they have a right to challenge it in court & produce evidence in support of their claims”.
Rubio said earlier: “Taking days to count legally cast votes is NOT fraud. And court challenges to votes cast after the legal voting deadline is NOT suppression.”
Retired Republican senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, was more direct: “No Republican should be okay with the President’s statements just now. Unacceptable. Period.”
He added: “Fellow Republicans, don’t wait until the election is called to defend our elections and our democratic institutions. The time is now.”
Former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, a Trump ally who is an analyst for ABC News, said there was no basis for Trump’s argument. Christie called Trump’s attack on the integrity of the election “a bad strategic decision” and “a bad political decision, and it’s not the kind of decision you would expect someone to make … who holds the position he holds”.
The comments by the Republican politicians and other GOP leaders were rare, public rebukes of Trump, who has demanded — and generally received — loyalty from fellow Republicans throughout his four-year term. Most in the GOP take pains to avoid directly criticising the president, even when they find his conduct unhelpful or offensive to their values and goals.

Trump’s tweets yesterday declaring victory and calling for officials to “STOP THE COUNT” were seen by some as a test of how firmly he can keep Republicans in line as he tries to challenge the voting process in court.
Donald Trump leaves after his address to reporters. Looking worn and deflated, the incumbent president did not take questions from journalists.
Before Trump’s speech in the White House briefing room, several Republicans challenged his attempts to halt vote-counting in Pennsylvania and other battleground states.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Trump ally who won re-election Tuesday in Kentucky, told reporters that “claiming you’ve won the election is different from finishing the counting”. His office declined to comment after Trump’s address on Thursday.
Representative Will Hurd, a Texas Republican who did not seek re-election, called Trump’s comments about corruption “dangerous” and “wrong”. He said Trump’s remarks undermined the US political process and “the very foundation this nation was built upon”, adding: “Every American should have his or her vote counted.”
While Biden is close to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House, it was unclear when a national winner would be determined after a long, bitter campaign dominated by the coronavirus pandemic and its effects on Americans and the national economy.
GOP Senator Mitt Romney did not address Trump’s remarks directly, but sought to provide a reassuring note. Counting votes was often “long” and “frustrating”, Romney said.
If any irregularities are alleged, “they will be investigated and ultimately resolved in the courts”, Romney tweeted. “Have faith in democracy, our Constitution and the American people.”
Other GOP figures came out in support for Trump over his comments as did his family, who took to Twitter to question why GOP politicians were not rushing to the president’s defence.
“Where are Republicans! Have some backbone. Fight against this fraud. Our voters will never forget you if your sheep!” Trump’s son Eric tweeted.","Trump said last night the ballot-counting process was unfair and corrupt.",19,0,0,35350,"Nov 6th 2020, 8:46 AM"
1106,194,"Twitter suspends Steve Bannon's account for saying Dr Anthony Fauci should be beheaded",https://www.thejournal.ie/twitter-suspends-steve-bannon-account-after-he-calls-for-dr-fauci-to-be-beheaded-5257462-Nov2020/,"TWITTER HAS SUSPENDED an account belonging to former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon after he suggested that Dr Anthony Fauci and FBI Director Christopher Wray should be beheaded. 
Bannon falsely claimed Donald Trump had won the election and said that he should fire both Fauci and Wray. He then went further to say he would have them beheaded as “a warning to federal bureaucrats”. 
The comments were made during a livestream of Bannon’s ‘War Room: Pandemic’ online show.
The video was posted on Facebook and had been viewed more than 200,000 times before Facebook removed it. The video was also posted on Facebook Live where it was viewed 454,000 times.
CNN reports that YouTube also removed the video for violating its policy against “inciting violence”.
Facebook has also banned a large group called Stop the Steal that supporters of Donald Trump were using to organise protests against the presidential vote count.
Some members had called for violence, while many falsely claimed Democrats were “stealing” the election from Republicans.
Though the group amassed more than 350,000 members before Facebook took it down, it was just one of several smaller groups that appeared as vote counting extended for days in several battleground states.
Inside the groups, members and organisers tried to ensure they would evade Facebook’s moderators and “trolls” who might report or mock them.
“In line with the exceptional measures that we are taking during this period of heightened tension, we have removed the Group ‘Stop the Steal’, which was creating real-world events,” Facebook said in a statement.
“The group was organised around the delegitimisation of the election process, and we saw worrying calls for violence from some members of the group.”
Facebook said it would continue to watch for activity violating its rules and would take action if necessary.
As of yesterday afternoon, a copycat Stop the Steal group was growing steadily, nearing 13,000 members, and others were easily searchable on Facebook.
Inside the groups, members organised protests and posted baseless claims of voter fraud.

Calls for violence were not immediately apparent, although the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) shared a screenshot of one post in the now-banned group that read: “Neither side is going to concede. Time to clean the guns, time to hit the streets.”
In the new group, administrators — who create and moderate groups on Facebook, cautioned people to keep posts civil and vent frustrations without making threats. They scrupulously warned members they would remove any posts calling for violence, and said they were making plans to move the group to other, less-moderated platforms.
Imran Ahmed, CEO of the CCDH, which pressured Facebook to take down the group, said while it was true the process of stopping such groups seemed like a game of whack-a-mole, the moles were slowly learning their lesson.
“By taking out the largest one, it sent a message to others,” he said.
But Ahmed said it should not be so difficult to get Facebook to take action on such a large group calling for violence.","Bannon suggested that Dr Anthony Fauci and FBI Director Christopher Wray should be beheaded “as a warning to federal bureaucrats”.",120,0,0,95380,"Nov 6th 2020, 7:53 AM"
1107,189,"Trump supporters protest outside count centres in several US states",https://www.thejournal.ie/trump-supporters-protest-outside-vote-centres-5257459-Nov2020/,"ELECTION OFFICIALS IN several US states have expressed fears about the safety of their workers amid a stream of threats and gatherings of angry protesters outside their doors, spurred by Donald Trump’s claims of a corrupt election.
Groups of Trump supporters, some of them armed, have gathered at vote tabulation sites in Phoenix, Detroit and Philadelphia, decrying counts that showed Democrat Joe Biden leading or gaining ground.
While the protests have not been violent or very large, local officials were distressed by the crowds and concerned about the relentless accusations.
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel tweeted a plea to “stop making harassing & threatening calls” to her staff.
“Asking them to shove sharpies [markers] in uncomfortable places is never appropriate & is a sad commentary on the state of our nation,” wrote Nessel, a Democrat.
Nessel was referring to a false conspiracy theory that Trump supporters were told to fill out ballots with Sharpie markers instead of regular pens so that their votes would not be counted by the machines.

Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, speaking on CNN, said her main concern was staff safety but that sheriff’s deputies were providing protection. She said protesters were “causing delay and disruption and preventing those employees from doing their job”.
On Thursday, around 100 Trump supporters gathered again in front of the Maricopa County election centre in Phoenix, some carrying military-style rifles and handguns. Arizona law allows people to openly carry guns.
Authorities at the centre used fences to create a “freedom of speech zone” and keep the entrance to the building open. The crowd took turns chanting — “Count the votes!” and “Four more years!” — and complaining through a megaphone about the voting process.
They paused to listen as Trump spoke from the White House, where he repeated many of his groundless assertions of a rigged vote.
They whooped and clapped when the president said, “We’re on track to win Arizona.” The Associated Press has called Arizona for Biden.
In Atlanta, roughly 100 chanting Trump supporters gathered outside State Farm Arena as votes were being counted. Several Atlanta police officers monitored the scene.
Tom Haas, 50, who said he was visiting Atlanta from Chicago on business, said he was convinced Trump had won the election. “There’s obvious voter fraud, and it’s coming out of the larger Democratic-run cities,” he said. “Atlanta is one of them.”
“Our democracy is under attack,” he said, echoing Trump’s language.
A few dozen Trump supporters gathered outside Detroit’s convention centre on Thursday morning as election workers counted absentee ballots inside. The protesters held signs that read, “Stop the steal” and “Stop the cheat”.
In Las Vegas, around 100 backers of the president chanted as they stood along the road in front of the election offices.

AFTER A GRUELLING 48-plus hours, it looks like there may be a result in the US presidential election on the horizon. 
Joe Biden, who tonight repeated his belief that he will win and become the 46th President of the United States, has 264 electoral college votes and needs to secure one of Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina or Pennsylvania to reach the magic number of 270. 
Trump, in a press conference at the White House after midnight claimed – without any evidence – that he is being cheated out of a win. His team has begun legal action in three of the battleground states to either stop counting or insist his team are given greater access to scrutinise the process.
The president needs to win all four of those states to win a second term but his path to victory has increasingly narrowed. 
Here’s a rundown of the key things to know from the results so far:
Trump made a number of illogical and baseless remarks about how the election was conducted in a press conference at the White House. 
Biden has announced he has “no doubt” he is going to win the election. He also called on people to be calm and patient. 
Earlier this afternoon, the president called for all counting to stop, tweeting “Stop The Count!” and “Any vote that came in after Election Day will not be counted!”
The Secretary of State for Pennsylvania has said the state is expecting to have the “overwhelming majority” of its votes counted today. Trump’s lead has narrowed there to about 65,000 votes. 
Counting in Georgia, which carries 16 electoral college votes, is 99% complete and Trump’s lead has dramatically shrunk to about 3,500. The Biden camp is confident the remaining 18,000 ballots will hand him the key state.
In Nevada Biden holds a narrow lead of around 11,500 votes. Counting is 87% complete.
Why is this taking so long? The pandemic, mainly. 
Biden took the states of Michigan and Wisconsin yesterday evening.
Trump is so far projected to win 23 states, including Texas, Ohio and Florida, having outperformed pollsters’ predictions.
Trump’s campaign said it will request a recount in Wisconsin after Biden won the state by less than 1% of the vote. It also looked to stop the count in Michigan. 
Overall turnout at the election is projected to be the highest in 120 years at 66.9%.
Here’s a piece looking at what lawsuits the Trump campaign has launched and why. 
The election has raised questions about polling efficacy again. Did they get it wrong? We take a look here.
Our columnist Larry Donnelly’s analysis looks at what Trumpism means for America’s future.
Dozens of Trump supporters began protesting outside a vote-tallying centre in Detroit last night chanting “stop the count”. 
A number of conspiracy theories have emerged since the president started talking about election fraud. Here are some examples of that misinformation. 
Here’s what you need to know about the Senate and House of Representatives after the election
A group of international observers has found that the US presidential election was “competitive and well managed” but condemned Donald Trump’s “baseless accusations” of systemic fraud saying they undermine public trust in democratic institutions.
Prop 114: Colorado has voted to reintroduce wolves to its western mountains. 
Here are the state result projections at the moment.
Trump said in the early hours of yesterday morning he will go to the Supreme Court with his team launching several legal bids to stop counting later that day.

Speaking to reporters at the White House he said: 
“If you count the legal votes I easily won. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us.”
Without providing any evidence, he claimed that there had been “historic election interference by big media, big money and big tech” in the 2020 election.
Speaking at a press conference in the White House press briefing room, he added: 
“I have already decisively won many critical states including massive victories in Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, to name just a few.
Without evidence, he again claimed: “We won these and many other victories despite historic election interference from big media, big money and big tech.”
His comments come after Joe Biden earlier said he had “no doubt” that he was going to become the 46th president of the United States. 
Biden urged Americans to “stay calm” and to wait until every vote was counted.
Speaking hours after the former Vice President’s brief remarks, as his lead continued to narrow in the key states of Georgia and Pennsylvania, Trump claimed the Republicans were “winning in all the key locations” but then their lead had been “whittled away”.
“We were winning in all the key locations by a lot, actually, and then our numbers started miraculously getting whittled away in secret.”
Referring to legally permissible observers, the US President claimed that when observers arrived, they were told to be “100 feet away” from the count.
“When the observers got there, they wanted them 60, 70 feet away, 80 feet, 100 feet away, or outside the building, to observe people inside the building”, he told reporters.

On the postal vote system, Trump added: “I’ve been talking about mail-in voting for a long time. It’s really destroyed our system, it’s a corrupt system.”
He claimed the “blue wave” predicted by the polls had never materialised and there had been a “big red wave instead”.
He added: “The pollsters got it knowingly wrong.
“There was no blue wave that they predicted, they thought there was going to be a big blue wave – that was false, it was done for suppression reasons.
But instead there was a big red wave and it has been properly acknowledged by the media, they were, I think, very impressed but that’s after the fact.
He challenged Joe Biden and the Democrats to “clarify that they only want legal votes”.
“They talk about votes, I think they should call them legal votes, they want every legal vote counted and I want every legal vote counted,” he said.
He added he wanted “openness and transparency” during the process without “secret count rooms”, “mystery ballots” or votes cast after the official election day.
“They want the process to be an honest one, it’s so important”, he said.
“We want an honest election, an honest count and we want honest people working back there because it’s a very important job.
That’s the way this country is going to win, that’s the way the United States is going to win.
Trump said his party thought they would win the election “very easily” but that there would be “a lot of litigation” involved.

“We have so much evidence, so much proof and it’s going to end up, perhaps, at the highest court in the land”, he said.
“We think there will be a lot of litigation because we can’t have an election stolen like this.”
Trump said his goal was to “defend the integrity” of the election, despite offering no evidence of voter fraud during his press conference.
Biden, throughout the campaign, urged his supporters to vote by post if they needed to, due to fears over the coronavirus pandemic. Trump repeatedly cast doubt on the integrity of that system and called for his voters to vote in person on election day. 
The states still in play are currently counting the postal votes, which skew heavily in favour of Biden, having counted the election day votes – which skewed in favour of Trump – first. 
Biden earlier told reporters in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware:
“We continue to feel very good about where things stand. We have no doubt that when the count is finished, Senator Harris and I will be declared the winners.” 
Biden made similar remarks in a speech yesterday evening. 
As it stands per projections by Associated Press, Democrat Biden has 264 electoral college votes and just one additional state should clinch him a victory. 
Biden would require a win in either Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina or his home state Pennsylvania to reach the necessary 270 votes.
As additional votes are added to his tally, Biden continues to gain on Trump in Pennsylvania. A final result may emerge in the state overnight, Irish time.  ","Trump insisted there had been “historic election interference by big media, big money and big tech”.",45,0,1,47542,"Nov 6th 2020, 12:03 AM"

A joint study between the European Commission and researchers at Dublin City University found rates were highest in Ireland, followed by Italy and Germany.
The younger children were, the more likely they were to become victims, the study found, with the problem particularly prevalent in young boys.
Tijana Milosevic, of the National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre, said the results are higher than in previous studies.
She said: “Irish children are among the top frequency numbers in Europe that we have. That is worrying in and of itself.
“This was a survey that was done with children in 10 other European countries with children aged 10 to 18.
“We conducted research into their use of digital media but also their experience of risks and their exposure to different types of online harm, cyberbullying being one of those.
“We see a 28% increase in cyberbullying victimisation during the lockdown.”
The findings were presented to the Oireachtas Committee on Education to mark the UN International Day Against Violence and Bullying in Schools.
Overall, 49% of males had experienced significantly more frequent cyberbullying since lockdown.
About 66% of all children between 14 and 16 experienced significantly more cyberbullying compared with pre-lockdown on instant and private messaging services such as WhatsApp, Viber and Telegram.
Dr Milosevic said: “This is an increase compared to previous studies in Ireland, which have shown a cyberbullying victimisation rate of about 14% for primary schools and just under 10% for post-primary schools.
“There has been an increase, but it’s not as huge of a spike as we might have expected based on media reports we were seeing during the lockdown.”

She said social media platforms had to do more as the lines between in-school bullying and cyberbullying become increasingly blurred.
“It’s different now, especially in the context of Covid, when a lot of the schooling has happened online – the line between school bullying and out-of-school bullying will become ever more blurry.
“It is extremely important to have a way to actually report and engage the platforms to assist cases when it does happen.”
Seline Keating, a professor and research fellow in anti-bullying studies at DCU, called for a single anti-bullying programme to be implemented in schools nationwide.
She warned that current measures, adopted in 2013, were not being fully implemented in some schools – particularly in relation to identity-based bullying such as homophobia and transphobia.

The Czech Republic side had a clutch of players missing through injury and Covid-19 issues, including number one goalkeeper Milan Heca and teenage star Adam Hlozek, but they took the lead in the 26th minute through striker Julis, and he scored a second just before the interval.
Celtic substitute Leigh Griffiths pulled a goal back in the 64th minute, shortly after coming off the bench, and the Scottish champions, who had lost to AC Milan at home and drawn at Lille in their first two Group H fixtures, then piled on the pressure.
However, they were undone yet again in the 76th minute when Julis tapped in a breakaway goal before substitute Ladislav Krejci headed in a fourth in the final minute to complete a chastening night for Neil Lennon’s side.
Celtic went into the game on a high after their impressive 2-0 Scottish Cup semi-final win over Aberdeen at Hampden Park on Sunday ended a rare four-game winless run.
Lennon kept an unchanged side, unsurprisingly, but it was a somewhat calamitous night for the Scottish champions, who came unstuck in a tumultuous spell midway through the first half.
David Moberg Karlsson, who had a short spell at Kilmarnock, had a drive saved by the foot of goalkeeper Scott Bain before he cracked the top of a post with another effort.
Bain did well to tip a shot from Julis over the crossbar for a corner, but from Moberg Karlsson’s delivery, defender David Hancko sent a header against a post and from the rebound Julis, again unmarked, lashed the ball high into the net.
The goal shook the home side but they came close to levelling in the 38th minute when Mohamed Elyounoussi ghosted into the box to get on the end of a terrific cross by Ryan Christie but his cushioned volley clipped the top of the bar and went over, with stand-in keeper Florin Nita beaten.

Sparta’s second goal, which arrived seconds before the break, came when Adam Karabec set up Julis inside the box and he neatly sidestepped Hoops midfielder Callum McGregor before curling the ball low past Bain and into the corner of the net.
The half-time interval gave Lennon the chance to sort things out, but Julis soon had the chance for his hat-trick. Bain’s slack pass was intercepted by Karabec who shifted it quickly to the Czech striker but he lofted his shot high over.
Shortly after Jeremie Frimpong flashed a drive past the far post, Lennon brought on Griffiths and Hatem Elhamed for Elyounoussi and skipper Scott Brown.
In the 63rd minute Sparta midfielder Michal Sacek drove into the Celtic box and smashed a shot off a post with Bain beaten and seconds later, Celtic reduced the deficit.
Griffiths played the ball to Tom Rogic and when his shot from inside the area was parried by Nita, the Hoops substitute raced in to slam the loose ball into the net.
But the visitors scored a classic counter-attacking goal as Moberg Karlsson skipped past Shane Duffy with ease to set up Julis a couple of yards out and the final nail came at the end when Borek Dockal curled a cross in for fellow sub Krejci to head into the net.

As the Democrat edges closer to the White House, residents in Ballina, Co Mayo, are already planning to roll out the red carpet for his return.
Biden’s great-great-great-grandfather Edward Blewit emigrated from the town almost 200 years ago, having worked as a brick-maker and as a civil engineer helping to map Ireland.
Locals in the town now hope Biden can follow in his ancestor’s footsteps by putting Ballina on the map.
Ten of his 16 great-great-grandparents were also born in Ireland.
A mural of Biden, which overlooks the main square in the old market town, was recently created by local artists Smiler Mitchell and Leslie Lackey.
After the unveiling, Biden pledged to revisit the town if he wins the election.

He first visited Ballina in June 2016 as US vice-president, and met with a number of relatives including Joe and Laurita Blewit.
Blewit said he believes his cousin will be the next president of the US.
He added: “It will be unreal for the family. I have met him three or four times now and to know someone who is going to be the president of the United States is unreal.
“I was in the White House a few years ago and it was a cool place to be in so I am looking forward to going back again.
“I am confident he will win, though I wasn’t too sure on Tuesday if he would win but hopefully tonight he will make it.
“It’s great for Ballina, the mural has attracted a lot of attention. We sent him a picture of the mural – he couldn’t get over it.
“He actually robbed my line and wrote on his home house in Scranton (Pennsylvania) ‘from my house to the White House’.
“Everyone in Ballina is proud of him.”

Anthony Heffernan, who owns Heffernan cafe and butchers in the Market Square, hosted Biden and some 20 of his entourage in 2016.
“Mr Biden came here on a family visit and he gathered about 22 of his distant relatives and had a meal with them to get to know them,” he said.
“They chose our building because it was secure. Sniffer dogs went through the building, it was very exciting.
“The Bidens were lovely people – they just wanted to talk about Ballina and find out the history of the town and what it was like when their family were here.
“Everyone is very keen and paying close attention to the election, we are pretty sure he will get in though I don’t think Mr Trump will give in easily.
“I think Joe Biden spoke very well on Wednesday night.
“He has told relatives here that he will be back when he becomes president.”
One of Biden’s distant relatives, Bernie Finan, has met the Democrat twice.
“I first met him when he was coming down the main street and was shaking hands with everyone and I spoke to him and told him we are related,” he said.
“I asked if he would mind that I contact him when he got back to the US and he said it would be fine.
“He seems nice, a simple man of the people and that’s reflected in the vote in recent days.
“I’ve been keeping a very close eye on it, I switched the radio on when I went to bed and then spent most of yesterday and today listening to it.
“He’s edging that bit closer and I heard the bookies gave him three-to-one and seldom do the bookies make a mistake.
“Biden and the razzle dazzle has been good for Ballina. Let’s hope it will be more useful in the future as it’s a beautiful town.”
Among many of the locals flying the flag for the presidential hopeful was Maria Bourke from Knockmore.
She said: “We hope Biden will win it and not the other one (Donald Trump).
“I think the whole world wants Biden to win.
“Ballina will go mad and I hope there are no restrictions when he comes to visit as the whole town will go mad.

Mary, who did not want to give her surname, said it is likely Biden will return to the county as president.
She was among the thousands of people on the streets to greet the Bidens in 2016.
“I spoke to him and shook his hand, it was very exciting, she said.

“It was very relaxed – just like Biden.
“He was walking down the street and spoke to everyone and there were no issues.
“It was a very exciting day for everyone. He was all smiles and we were all smiles.

The passing of Proposition 114 tasks the parks and wildlife commission with having to plan by 2023 for an arrangement to reintroduce gray wolves to Colorado’s western mountains.
It is hoped that the idea will provide a bridge between grey wolf populations in the north and south of the country, helping the species rebound, some 80 years after they disappeared from the state. 
Backers of the idea, say the presence of an apex predator can have a massively beneficial trickle-down effect on an ecosystem – as documented in Yellowstone in the US, where wolves were brought back in the mid-1990s.
Despite the opposition of Colorado’s farmers, ranchers and big game hunters, the proposition passed with a narrow margin of 50.3% to 49.7%, split along urban and rural lines. 
The question of the reintroduction of wolves is one that’s been raised in Ireland, with Eamon Ryan, leader of the Green Party, calling for the reintroduction of the predator to help rewild parts of the countryside last October. But the idea was rejected by then Culture Minister, Josepha Madigan, who said the government had no plans to do so.

Here's what we know so far",https://www.thejournal.ie/poll-united-states-election-2020-5254348-Nov2020/,"ALTHOUGH IT’S STILL too early to call the winner of the US presidency, pollsters are already being criticised by some for inaccurate predictions. 
In 2016, polling companies and poll aggregators like Real Clear Politics and FiveThirtyEight were widely criticised for their predictions of a relatively clear win for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump.  
FiveThirtyEight predicted that Hillary Clinton had a 71.4% chance of winning the election and Trump with a 28.6% chance. As we know now, Clinton won the popular vote but Trump won the Electoral College vote, leading him to the White House. 
This time around, the polling site had given Biden an 89% chance of winning and Trump a 10% chance. 
A journalist with the Atlantic described this year’s results so far as a “disaster for the polling industry and for media outlets and analysts that package and interpret the polls for public consumption”. 
Two Politico journalists wrote: “The polling industry is a wreck, and should be blown up.” 
Almost all of the polls in 2016 put Clinton ahead of Trump overall and polls overestimated Democratic support in some important states like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. 
A lot of the states in which polls were off the mark turned out to to be the ones crucial to deciding the next president. 
We won’t know the overall winner this year until possibly tomorrow, but as most states have been called already we spoke to Irish pollsters to hear their take on the situation with US polls for this year’s election. 
‘Difficult to poll’ 
Speaking to TheJournal.ie, Richard Colwell, the CEO of Red C research which conducts polls and other research in Ireland, said so far the US polls seem to have been half right and half wrong.
“I think there is a really big difference between what the polls say and what’s extrapolated out of those polls to work out Electoral College votes and seats,” he said. 
You can’t judge the polls really until all the counts are done.
“I can understand why people are calling for [criticism of polls] in the current age when everything is so instant. The immediate response is that ‘oh the polls got it wrong’,” he added, referring to initial results showing Trump performing very well at the start.
He said that the way people voted this time around is so different to previous elections which likely made it “much more difficult to poll”.
More than 100 million Americans voted ahead of Election Day, according to the US Elections Project watchdog. 
Mail-in ballots, ballots deposited in drop boxes or cast at polling stations ahead of time represent more than 72% of the total number of votes cast in the 2016 presidential election. 
Workers processing mail-in and absentee ballots in the US yesterday.

In the previous election, around 57 million people voted early. Colwell said Biden’s current lead of almost 3% ahead of Trump in the popular vote is “pretty much within the margin of error” of predictions at the moment. 
However, he said from what we know so far, “some of the state polls were pretty bad”.
“Some were promising pretty strong wins for Biden which then Trump went on to win quite comfortably,” Colwell said. 
Colwell said some states with very tight margins should have been defined as “too close to call” by pollsters, instead of putting a really close number on it. 
He said that, based on his own experience with polling, voter turnout could explain part of the reason for some polling outliers. 
Whenever you’re running a poll, you have to estimate what you expect turnout to be, based on historical elections and what people are telling you.
The much higher portion of voters casting their ballots ahead of time and not on the day could play a part in this. 
Colwell added that it is “getting much harder to poll” compared to around 20 years ago when “people responded much more”.
It’s a lot harder to poll now, but it can be done. The election here and in the UK has shown that.
He said there will always be people arguing that pollsters are “not putting in the effort” to fix errors, but “the last thing they want to do is not get the poll right”.
“Complicated place to poll’
A worker pushing ballots to be processed in Pennsylvania, United States.

Damian Loscher, the managing director of polling and research company Ipsos MRBI, said the United States is a “very complicated place to poll”.
Ipsos MRBI conducted a poll on behalf of RTÉ, the Irish Times, TG4 and UCD for the general election result earlier this year.
It was based on responses from more than 5,000 people at 250 polling stations across the country after voting on the day of the election. 
Loscher said the way voting is conducted in Ireland allows pollsters to adhere “to what would be considered robust, scientific research principles”. 
“You can’t have a proper conversation about polling without getting really dull and scientific – it doesn’t really suit media discussion and debate,” he said. 
As many people in the US vote ahead of time, particularly this year, this hinders the polling process as pollsters use other methods like online surveys. 
Loscher said these surveys don’t represent every member of the population and “don’t adhere to these scientific principles in the same way”. 
“We have been doing it the same way for the past 50 years because the science supports that ideology. They have moved to new methodologies – once you do this, there are new challenges to pollsters.
And those challenges mean that the plus or minus 3% doesn’t really apply anymore.”
He added that “we won’t know how the polls did until all the votes are counted”. 
He said the concern for pollsters is not necessarily being a few points out, but whether any polling issues are due to a systemic problems or a random error. 
He added that the negative reaction to US polls at the last election “unfortunately means that when they’re a little bit wrong this time, it looks like a pattern”. 
In terms of the theory of the ‘shy Trump’ voter who doesn’t admit to voting Trump on the day, Loscher said this same concept sometimes applies in Ireland.
“There certainly was an element of the ‘shy Trump’ voter in the same way as we have in Ireland had, on occasion, shy voters.
Whether it was a shy Sinn Féin voter because of associations with the IRA or a shy Fianna Fáil voter because of economic collapse, we have always felt that shy voters were reasonably immaterial… not to the point where it would materially impact a poll getting it right or wrong.
He said that these shy voters would not hugely impact poll results, “not to the point where if a poll missed it by six or seven points, you might blame a shy Trump vote for a small fraction of this”.
“This time around, we should not interpret just how good the polls are… until the full polls are counted.”

In 2016, FiveThirtyEight predicted a 71.4% chance of Hillary Clinton winning the election and a 28.6% chance of a Trump win. 
In terms of the divide over popular and Electoral votes, Hillary Clinton was projected to win 301 Electoral College votes, well above Trump’s predicted 235 votes. 
As a reminder, the first candidate to reach 270 Electoral votes becomes the new president. 
In terms of the popular vote, it was predicted to be 48.5% to Clinton and 44.9% to Trump. This was within the 3% margin of error for the actual result – 48.2% of the vote went to Clinton and 46.1% to Trump.

What lawsuits has Trump's campaign team launched and why?
Here’s a look at some of the key swing states, and what was predicted in 2016 and 2020 against the actual result in 2016 and what we know so far from this year’s vote.
Florida 
Clinton was projected to win Florida by less than 1% of the vote in 2016, but Trump won this state by 1.2% more than Clinton in the end. 
Biden was favoured ahead in the projections for Florida in this year’s election, with a lead of more than 2% over Trump.
However, Trump has taken the state with over 3% more of the vote than Biden. 
Pennsylvania 
This state was also won by Trump in 2016 with less than 1% more of the vote than Clinton.
The polls were just off on this one, with projections on Election Day saying Clinton would win by almost 4% ahead of Trump. 
Projections for this election put Biden with a lead of almost 5% over Trump. 
This is a key state and Trump is currently leading by almost 2% ahead of Biden with 88% of votes reported. 
Votes for this state could be in by the end of today in the US, which could be the deciding factor for the winner of the presidency if Biden takes the state as is currently expected. 
Nevada 
This state was won by Hillary Clinton in 2016 with a lead of just over 2% over Trump. The polls got this one right, as it was projected by FiveThirtyEight that Clinton would win the state by less than 2%.
This time around, projections put Biden in the lead with 6% more of the vote. 
Biden is currently leading in the state by around 11,400 votes 
North Carolina 
Trump won North Carolina in 2016 with a winning margin of 3.66%. Projections ahead of time said Clinton would win by less than 1%. 
In 2020, projections put Biden with a lead of less than 2% in this state. 
It’s still too soon to call, but 94% of votes have been reported so far. Trump is currently in the lead by less than 2%. 
Ohio
Trump also took Ohio in 2016 with a significant 8% lead over Hillary Clinton. Polls had predicted he would win the state by 2%.
This year’s projections had Trump in the lead with a very tight margin of just 0.6%. 
ABC and other news outlets said at 5am on Wednesday that Trump would take Ohio.  
Iowa 
Trump took the state of Iowa in 2016 with a lead of almost 10% ahead of Clinton. Polls underestimated this one, with projections showing Trump winning by just under 3%.

In Iowa, 2020 projections show Trump winning the state by 1.5%. The Associated Press has called it and said he will win with a lead of more than 8%. 
Wisconsin 
Trump took Wisconsin in 2016 with just over 1% of the vote ahead of Clinton.
This narrow win was not forecast in the predictions, with Clinton expected to take the state by more than 5% ahead of Trump. 
This year, Biden was projected to take the state with a lead of more than 8%. 
The Associated Press has already called this state as a win for Biden, but less than 1% ahead of Trump. 
Georgia 
Trump won this state by more than 5% in 2016 with polls ahead of time predicting a 4% lead for the Republican. 
This year’s projections show Biden with a lead of just less than 1% ahead. The race is very tight in Georgia at the moment as the count continues.
It’s still too close to call with Trump on 49.5% of the vote and Biden on 49.2%. 
Arizona 
Trump took the state of Arizona in 2016 with almost 4% ahead of Clinton. The projections on Election Day that year said Trump would win by just over 2%. 
For the 2020 election, Biden was projected to take the state by over 2.5% more than Trump. 
Fox News was the first to project that Joe Biden had won the state of Arizona at approximately 4.30am this Wednesday. 
False tweets emerged online saying Fox News retracted this prediction around an hour later.
This was untrue and Fox brought on a member of its decision desk to further solidify this prediction. 
Fox has continued to stand by its call of Arizona. 
The Associated Press also later called this state as a win for Biden. However, the state still hasn’t been called by the New York Times, CNN or CBC as votes are still being counted. 
Trump has disputed the call of Biden winning Arizona. 
The Associated Press said it made the decision “after an analysis of ballots cast statewide concluded there were not enough outstanding to allow Trump to catch up”.
With 80% of the expected vote counted, Biden was ahead by 5 percentage points, with a roughly 130,000-vote lead over Trump with about 2.6 million ballots counted. The remaining ballots left to be counted, including mail-in votes in Maricopa County, where Biden performed strongly, were not enough for Trump to catch up to the former vice president.","It’s still too soon to judge the total accuracy of US pollsters, but let’s take a look at current knowledge.",6,0,0,17555,"Nov 5th 2020, 8:34 PM"

Under pressure: why athletes choke
Anyone who’s ever watched sport will have seen it. Athletes in peak physical condition. They’ve trained for years, decades to get to this moment.
This is their time to show what they can do. But, sometimes, it doesn’t work out that way and they blow it at the crucial moment.

“Athletes weighed down by anxiety also use their eyes less efficiently. When table tennis players are anxious, they spend longer fixating on the ball and less time on their opponent, which may reduce their ability to pick up cues and anticipate what will happen next.
When tennis players are anxious, they become less effective at picking up contextual information such as the sequencing of shots in the rally and the probability of their opponent playing certain types of shots.
“Other anxiety-induced responses include hypervigilance – the ‘deer in the headlights’ phenomenon – a narrowed field of view or tunnel vision, or paying attention to irrelevant sights. In each of these cases, anxious athletes are likely to miss critical information.”

Rapid Vienna 4
Dundalk 3
DUNDALK ARE STILL searching for their first point in Europa League Group B, despite producing a performance to be proud of this evening in the Austrian capital.
Rapid Vienna are off the mark after emerging on the right side of this seven-goal thriller, but they had to come from behind following Patrick Hoban’s early opener.
Dejan Ljubicic got Rapid back on level terms midway through the first half of a game that was ultimately decided by a dramatic 16-minute period at the end, which saw five goals scored.
A much-changed Dundalk line-up showed six changes from the side that started last week’s defeat to Arsenal, one of which afforded a rare outing to goalkeeper Aaron McCarey.
Rapid Vienna were hindered by the absence of their leading goalscorer, Greek international striker Taxi Fountas, who’s been sidelined lately by a hand injury.

Outstanding midfielder Chris Shields, who set the tone for Dundalk, was the architect when they went in front with just under seven minutes on the clock at the Allianz Stadion.
A superb ball into the box from Shields found Hoban, and his header beat Rapid Vienna goalkeeper Paul Gartler, who probably should have done better.
Rapid responded positively, Christoph Knasmullner going close with a header. The equaliser did arrive on 22 minutes, however, and it was one that McCarey may have regrets over.
After finding himself in space, Ljubicic unleashed a swerving effort 30 yards out from goal that deceived the Dundalk goalkeeper before going in off the underside of the crossbar.
As Rapid sought to assume control of the contest, Dundalk remained organised and disciplined defensively. The Oriel Park side looked equal to the task and they soon gave another demonstration of the attacking threat they posed to the hosts.
With Rapid caught on the break, a through-ball from Jordan Flores released Michael Duffy. He showed good composure but his effort was blocked by Maximilian Ullmann.

The sides were level at the break, but Dundalk had to endure a couple of nervy moments first. After Ercan Kara’s powerful header narrowly missed the target, McCarey made amends by producing an important save to keep out Knasmullner’s well-struck volley.
Dundalk were almost rewarded for a bright start to the second half when Duffy struck the side-netting with a half-volley, the opportunity made more difficult as the angle was narrowed by a last-ditch lunge from Maximilian Hofmann.

At the other end moments earlier, Sean Hoare was fortunate not to concede a penalty for a challenge in the box that sent Kara crashing to the ground.
Entering the final quarter, Dundalk had to withstand a sustained spell of Rapid pressure. McCarey made crucial saves to deny Mario Sonnleitner and Yusuf Demir, while Shields, Hoare and Dan Cleary were also on hand with vital interventions.
In the 79th minute, Rapid eventually went ahead. Thorsten Schick’s cross was punched away by McCarey, but the ball fell kindly for Kelvin Arase to head home.
Nevertheless, their lead didn’t last long. On the back of good work by Nathan Oduwa for Dundalk, fellow substitute David McMillan was tripped in the box by Sonnleitner. Gartler got a hand to McMillan’s penalty but he was unable to keep it out.

Greg Sloggett was inches away from heading Dundalk into the ascendancy, before Hofmann made it 3-2 to Rapid in the 87th minute. Following a corner that was taken short, McCarey came to clear a ball into the danger area from Filip Stojkovic. However, the former Wolves stopper was beaten to it by the head of Hofmann.
Demir, a highly-regarded 17-year-old, increased Rapid’s lead as the game entered stoppage time when he ran at the Dundalk defence and steered a left-footed strike inside the far post.
In the fifth and final minute of additional time, McMillan got his second from the penalty spot after Oduwa was fouled by Stojkovic, but unfortunately for Filippo Giovagnoli’s side it was too little, too late.

CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER Dr Tony Holohan said he doesn’t anticipate Nphet recommending to the Government that non-essential retailers be allowed return to business before the six-week lockdown ends. 
Speaking at this evening’s briefing, Holohan said Nphet is “not anticipating changing our advice – but obviously we keep it under review”.
There had been calls to review the Level 5 restrictions at the end of its fourth week with some retailers hoping they could open their doors in the middle of this month instead of at the start of December – the original date for the Level 5 restrictions to be eased. 
Earlier today, retailers called for an early reopening date for shops if Covid-19 case numbers continue to fall, an industry body has said.
Retail Excellence, the largest representative body for retail in the country, urged the Government to clarify in the next 10 days its plans to reopen non-essential retail so that retailers can prepare for Christmas.
The organisation’s managing director Duncan Graham said it is crucial that the Government meets its realistic and achievable demands if the industry is to recover in 2021.
The group, whose members employ 280,000 staff, also wants Government and landlord support on rent bills which have accrued while businesses have been in lockdown.
Graham said: “This lockdown has been catastrophic for the retail sector.
“Our priority now is to look ahead to the end of this month and the earliest possible reopening of non-essential retail so that we can meet consumer demand and save our retail businesses.”
Graham said that, as a starting point, the Government must prioritise the reopening of the shops as soon as possible.

“A delayed reopening means fewer shopping days and that means busier shopping days,” he said.
There is a real logic to making sure we reopen non-essential retail as quickly as possible so we can effectively manage consumer demand in our shops and towns.”
He said that retailers also needed help with rents and other costs if they were to survive.
“We have heard countless examples of landlords demanding full rents from retailers who have been devastated this year,” said Mr Graham.
“If the Government does not support these businesses with adequate funding and support, retailers will suffer in 2021.”
Graham also said that retailers needed to see full co-operation from local authorities and city councils to help with the reopening process.

He also encouraged all shoppers to buy Irish during the festive season.
“We want all shoppers to shop local, shop Irish, and support Irish jobs.”
Retail Excellence said that retail has proven to be a safe environment for shoppers and retailers will be able to maintain this environment during this crucial period of the year.
There are currently 370 positive cases in hospital in Ireland, with 40 of those cases in intensive care units.
Of those 370 cases, 17 or 4.6% were in people aged 0-14 years old, 29 or 7.8% were aged between 15-34, while 119 or 32% were 35-64 with 8 ICU admissions in that age group.

A courts spokesperson said that the meeting took place this afternoon at the Four Courts.
However, an official statement about the meeting won’t be issued until next week.
The judges were due to discuss the ongoing fallout over Woulfe’s attendance at the controversial ‘Golfgate’ dinner in Clifden in August where 81 people gathered in what is viewed as a breach of the public health guidelines at the time.
The two judges were due to meet on four separate occasions in October, but the planned meeting was postponed and eventually cancelled. Woulfe requested a postponement for “personal reasons” at first, and then later on “medical grounds”.
This meeting is part of the “informal resolution” that was recommended in a report to deal with Woulfe’s attendance at the Golfgate dinner, which resulted in the resignation of Dara Calleary as Agriculture Minister and Phil Hogan as the EU’s Trade Commissioner.
On Sunday, The Times reported that some Supreme Court judges have told Woulfe not all of his colleagues are happy or comfortable to sit alongside him on cases following the publication of the report former chief justice Susan Denham into his attendance at the golf dinner.

'Completely fake, overblown': Transcript shows judge compared media coverage of golf dinner to 'Ku Klux Klan'
Denham report
The review into Woulfe’s attendance at the dinner by Denham found it would be “unjust and disproportionate” for the judge to resign.
However, further controversy ensued after transcripts of an interview given by Woulfe to Denham in the course of the review were later released, and described media coverage of the scandal as “appalling” “overblown” and “fake”, with claims the social event was treated like the “Ku Klux Klan”.
Despite Woulfe issuing a statement where he apologised “unreservedly” for attending an event where breaches “may have occurred”, he said during this interview with Denham that though he apologised, he wasn’t sure what he had to apologise for.
He said: “If it still is the case that there was intentional breach on my part I obviously apologise, still apologise and apologise again. But it is fair to say that it appears now, objectively, that there was no breach by the organisers, let alone by me.”
Woulfe also said that he felt sorry for “some of the unfortunate politicians” who “feel the need to confess to a crime they may not have committed”.

In her report, Denham suggested that the fallout from the Golfgate controversy could be dealt with by way of an informal resolution.

The health service’s Chief Clinical Officer Dr Colm Henry, who also sits on the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), said consideration should be given to those who are socially isolated from others current Covid-19 restrictions.
Current Level 5 restrictions are set to be eased on 1 December, with speculation about what restrictions will be in place over the Christmas period.
And asked about the easing of restrictions, Henry suggested that public health officials and the Government should give consideration to older people.
“A few months is a long time for the rest of your life for an older person, particularly if you’re very old,” he said.
“Christmas is a special time. For some people, it may be their last Christmas.
“So whatever measures are implemented by Nphet or by Government, that protracted isolation for older people, for whom the rest of their lives might mean a much shorter degree of expectation than for younger or even middle aged people, is something they have to bear in mind.”
The HSE reported that the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 has fallen in recent weeks, and Henry said that Ireland is now one of only two European countries with a negative growth in the 14-day incidence rate.
But HSE CEO Paul Reid also warned that the situation could change rapidly.
“We must also remember everything to do with this virus is always very fragile,” Reid said.
“In a short period of time it all can change very quickly. In a short period of time we could find ourselves dealing with a similar trend that we’re seeing all over Europe.
“While it is good and positive that we’re bucking the trend, we equally know it can turn very quickly. The one proven certainty about the virus is its unpredictability.”
Henry added that a price had been paid, particularly in mainland Europe, for thinking that the virus had gone away.
He said it was of some comfort that Ireland had managed to avoid significantly higher case numbers currently being seen on the continent.
There are currently 370 positive cases in hospital in Ireland, with 40 of those cases in intensive care units.
Of those 370 cases, 17 or 4.6% were in people aged 0-14 years old, 29 or 7.8% were aged between 15-34, while 119 or 32% were 35-64 with 8 ICU admissions in that age group.

The remaining 205 cases, 55.4%, were 65 and over, with 29 ICU admissions.
Meanwhile, Reid also confirmed that the number of close contacts who had sought so-called Day 7 tests had improved in recent weeks.
It was reported last month that only half of those deemed to be close contacts of a confirmed Covid-19 case were turning up for their second test.
But Reid said today that the figure was now between 65 to 70%.
“It’s still really important to note that there are positive cases coming through on Day 7,” he said. “The Day Zero test is important, but the Day 7 test is equally important.”

The plans to upgrade the terminal, built in 1972, would see the roof and core façade of the building replaced with a new modern, energy-efficient structure.
The terminal’s existing concrete fins will make way for a combination of glass and solid panels to “create a fresh look for T1 that will improve the overall visual appearance of the airport campus”.
The northern and southern sides of T1 – effectively the front and the back of the building -will feature significantly more glazing within the new design and the removal of the 1970s concrete fins will create a distinctive new look for the terminal, Dublin Airport said. 
As the project is pending approval,  no date is set for these upgrade works to take place.
The project to upgrade the façade and other elements of Terminal 1 has been part of the long-term plans for Dublin Airport for several years, said Dublin Airport Managing Director Vincent Harrison. 
“While passenger traffic had been hit by the impact of COVID-19, as custodians of Dublin Airport on behalf of the State, DAA must always take a prudent long-term view in relation to managing the facility,” he said. 
“As certain elements of T1 are approaching the end of their life, it makes sense to seek planning permission now for these works, which will be carried out over the coming years.”

“Sustainability is at the heart of how we operate at Dublin Airport and this project will have a hugely positive impact on the overall energy consumption levels for Terminal 1,” he added. 
Harrison said the changes will generate a significant improvement in the terminal’s energy efficiency, as it will move the upgraded elements of building from their current BER rating of F to B3. 
Terminal 1 opened in May 1972 at a cost of £7 million and effectively replaced Dublin Airport’s original 1940s terminal. The newer terminal connected passengers more directly with Piers A and B – now the 200 and 300 boarding gate areas – which was built in the early 1960s.","Plans lodged by DAA aim to improve the terminal’s energy efficiency.",13,0,0,32509,"Nov 5th 2020, 5:48 PM"

That was my heartfelt and somewhat breathless reaction as I exited the RTÉ television studio early on Wednesday morning after hours of analysing the results long awaited by political watchers and anyone with an interest in or affinity for the United States. 
Crunching the raw numbers as vote totals emerged, it swiftly became apparent that there would be no early “blue wave” carrying Joe Biden and his fellow Democrats to resounding victories around the country. The contest between the former vice president and President Donald Trump would be a dogfight.
Notwithstanding the denials of some partisans on the left and others who disputed the methodologies utilised by certain pollsters, things were tightening. That Joe Biden, a native of Pennsylvania, spent most waking hours in the last days there, was indicative that his campaign was aware of a Trump surge.
To the president’s credit, following a disastrous performance in the first debate, his messaging improved.
He sought to make the election about anything except for his administration’s mishandling of the pandemic.
Opinion surveys showed that his cavalier and rambling dismissals of Covid-19’s severity, coupled with more than one ludicrous and offensive statement about how it should be dealt with, damaged his standing, especially with older voters.
In the final weeks, the central theme was that Biden might be the candidate, but that hard left-wingers in his party, like Bernie Sanders and AOC, would actually call the shots. 
His lines of critique were foreboding and deliberately designed to exploit fears and prejudices.
To his intended audience, though, their meaning was crystal clear.
A Biden triumph would lead to outrageously high taxes and related socialist initiatives, a government takeover of private health insurance plans, legalised abortion until the moment of birth, the eroding of the right to own guns and the unleashing of inner-city violence in the suburbs. They featured at rallies and on Twitter.
This tactic helped convince “soft Trump” and persuadable voters to return to the fold and back the president’s quest for a second term.
  Simultaneously, his focusing of hearts and minds elsewhere fostered the growth of sentiment to the effect that the president hadn’t done that bad a job in combatting the coronavirus, a global plague that he repeatedly and advantageously blamed on the Chinese government.
On the flip side, and by comparison to Trump, Team Biden executed a rather low-octane operation, with physically distanced gatherings to depict the 77-year-old as the responsible adult in the room. 
The lack of energy and enthusiasm, however, and what they portrayed not alone to attendees, but most importantly to those who saw and heard them broadcast, was underwhelming as against the pageantry and fervour manifest at every Trump rally.
The word unprecedented has been employed excessively about this race, yet it also applies to the outcome. 
At the time of writing, it seems extremely likely that Joe Biden will be inaugurated as the next President of the United States in January. He has a very good chance of reaching the required 270 Electoral College votes without Pennsylvania. If so, Trump and the GOP’s legal avenues are limited to recounts and other dubious claims.
In this event, countless Americans and concerned observers around the world will breathe a sigh of relief and rejoice that what they would call a nightmare is finally over.  But the probable conclusion of this fraught chapter in history sits beside two other truisms: “Trumpism” is alive and well and the Democratic Party must do some serious soul searching.
What should encourage us all, and rebuts overwrought critics of democratic processes in the US, is the record turnout of voters – in particular the young and people of colour.  Ample opportunities to vote early increased participation; these should be available long after the scourge of coronavirus is banished. 
Indeed, much of the rest of the world could learn something from the country of my birth on that score.
Conventional wisdom has always been that the more Americans who cast ballots, the better it is for the Democratic Party. Not on this occasion. Donald Trump garnered millions more votes than he received in 2016.
His tallies among women, millennials, blacks and Latinos were all better. His brand of politics and his persona still resonates. November 3rd did not deliver the repudiation hoped for by so many. Far from it.
While evaluating why Trump remains so popular, one must examine what is on offer from his foes. Ahead of this week, Democrats and their allies in the media were buoyant and quietly preparing to celebrate. 
Trump would be defeated; they would regain control of the US Senate; and they would have a bigger majority in the US House of Representatives. The party look to have narrowly won the White House, but look to have fallen short on the other two.
Two realities account for this failure. 
First, the Democrats have lost touch with the regular working men and women who used to constitute their base. Prioritising the cultural agenda of wealthy donors on the coasts may fill the coffers, but it has engendered a perception that they are indifferent to the plight of those who have suffered most from the furious march of globalisation and technology and consequent displacement and extraordinary income inequality.
Democrats can retort that they are unambiguously on the side of these Americans, but their endorsement of so-called free trade deals, advocacy for abandoning fossil fuels without adequately addressing the worries of those whose livelihoods are dependent upon associated industries and widespread intolerance of social conservatives tell a contrary tale. 
Perhaps even more detrimental has been the sneering, condescending, preachy manner in which some prominent figures have frequently articulated this change in emphasis and direction.

Second, they have taken the Latino community’s support for granted and spectacularly misread what animates them. The assumption had been that they would be just like African Americans: virtually homogenous in their preference for the Democratic Party. 
When Joe Biden recently let down his guard and said, “if you don’t vote for me, you ain’t black”, it revealed a prevalent mind-set in the hierarchy. 
Engagement with Latinos is an imperative.
That a proponent of building a wall across the border with Mexico to keep people from South and Central America out has obtained more than one-third of the Latino vote is illustrative of the depth of the problem.
They are the fastest growing bloc in the US. 
Many abhor socialism, own small businesses and prefer the Republican low-tax, light-touch regulation model and are people of strong religious faith and conviction. A political pivot may be in order to attract their hearts and minds.
Above all, the complicated result is a natural by-product of a divided America. 
When and if Joe Biden is deemed the winner, the immense, thankless and all but impossible task of reconciling profound differences will immediately confront him. At the very least, he must strive to re-introduce civil discourse in a wounded polity.
There have been many low points in the tenure of Donald Trump. 
His appalling post-election speech – in which he made a series of bizarre and incoherent allegations of fraud before declaring falsely that he had prevailed and would seek ultimate vindication from a Supreme Court he implied is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Trump, Inc. – was the nadir.
For me, the enduring image of this wretched year is a crowd of ostensibly patriotic Americans hooting and applauding wildly in response to the president’s verbal defecation on our grandest ideals, traditions and institutions.  Truth is stranger than fiction.

The Democrats had hoped to capitalise on anti-Trump sentiment but look unlikely to flip the Senate, as some had predicted.
Regardless of who wins the presidency, they will have to deal with partisan gridlock.
In 2018, Democrats took back control of the House of Representatives. They were expected, and are on track to, keep control.
However, Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s majority is shrinking – calling her leadership into question.
To date, Democrats have 208 seats to the Republicans’ 190; 218 seats are needed for a majority in the 435-member House. Members serve two-year terms.
Republicans have picked up six seats so far, deflating Pelosi’s hopes to increase her majority.

Republicans defeated several Democratic freshmen who delivered the House majority two years ago in a backlash against President Donald Trump, by linking them to their most liberal members, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and inaccurately branding them as socialists.
“We expanded this party that reflects America, that looks like America,” Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said in a conference call with reporters.
The Democrats were expected to keep their majority in the House, but the party has lost some seats.

Many pollsters also predicted that the Democrats would flip control of the Senate – political website FiveThirtyEight gave the party a 75% chance of doing this – but this does not look likely.

Republicans held a 53-47 Senate majority prior to the election. As things stand, with 31 of 35 races called, the Republicans have 48 seats to the Democrats’ 46, while independents have two seats (51 is needed for a majority).
Trouble for Biden?
If Joe Biden gets in, as predicted, a Republican-led Senate won’t make things easy for him.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said yesterday he was confident “no matter who ends up running the government” they would be “trying to overcome all that and get results”.
Incorrect projections will likely force a rethinking of polling, fundraising and the messages both parties use to reach voters.
Pelosi has all but declared Democrat Biden the winner – an outcome that is likely but not confirmed – yesterday saying House Democrats “will now have the opportunity to deliver extraordinary progress” on party priorities — lowering health care costs, providing jobs through new infrastructure, and other goals.
However, the poor outcome for congressional Democrats put in question the ambitious plans for legislative overhauls pushed by the party, eager for a sweep of Washington government.
Even if Democrats capture the White House and a narrowly split Senate, Pelosi’s leverage to force deal-making on her terms will be diminished by her House losses.
If Trump wins another term, his Republican allies – particularly in the Senate – will likely feel more comfortable sticking with him after escaping an electoral wipe-out, though they have yet to outline a GOP agenda.

Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist close to McConnell, said win or lose Trump “reorganised the political parties”, turning Republicans, not Democrats, into the party of “working-class” America.
“Democrats have a lot to think about when it comes to those voters,” Jennings said. “And Republicans have a lot to think about enacting policies germane to those voters.”
Democrats countered that with Biden on the brink of victory, the mandate for solutions to the coronavirus crisis, faltering economy and other big issues was as strong as ever.
“We’re going to get back to the business of governing,” Zac Petkanas, a Democratic strategist, said. “Republicans are going to have a choice — whether they’re going to be helpful or stand in way.”
Most immediately, a Covid-19 relief bill remains within reach, as the pandemic blazes through the states. McConnell said he would also like to negotiate a big spending bill to keep the government running past a mid-December deadline.

Sweetman is challenging a decision made in July to issue Coillte a ‘felling licence’ in respect of coniferous Sitka Spruce trees on 2.7 hectares of land on the Bellamont Forest Estate close to the town of Cootehill in Co Cavan.
The decision was made by the Forestry Appeal Committee, which he claims failed to carry out a proper or adequate screening of the site for the purposes of complying with the EU Habitats directive before it decided to grant the licence.
He claims that the site of the felling is near several designated Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special Areas of Protection (SAPs), and the impact on local species of birds and otters.
He is concerned about the potential damage to the local environment if the felling proceeds without the licence conditions being strictly complied with.
He is specifically concerned with the accumulation of debris and the run-off material contaminating local waterways
The High Court heard that Collite sought the licence from the Department of Agriculture, which was granted in 2019.
That decision was appealed by Sweetman to the relevant appeal body, the Forestry Appeals Committee, which last July authorised the tree felling.

He claims that in arriving at its decision to grant the licence the committee failed to consider other tree felling licences that have been granted for the overall area, nor he alleges did it have any regard to future felling operations in the locality.
He also claims that certain matters, including considering what type of chemicals will be used as part of the felling process and their effect on local ecosystems, were not properly considered by the committee.
In High Court judicial review proceedings against the Committee Sweetman seeks various orders and declarations including an order quashing the decision to issue the Felling Licence.
He also seeks a declaration that the Committee failed to conduct a proper screening of the site, in accordance with the requirement of EU Directives, including the Habitats Directive.

1135,180,"Government considering whether to make it mandatory for a person to restrict their movements",https://www.thejournal.ie/leo-varadkar-restirc-movemments-5256570-Nov2020/,"THE GOVERNMENT IS considering whether it should make it mandatory or legally enforceable for someone to restrict their movements or self isolate if they are a close contact or a confirmed case.
Speaking about the new EU traffic light system that will become operational in Ireland on Sunday, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said testing in relation to travel is going to be particularly important “given that as we get the numbers down the risk of reseeding becomes higher and we want to avoid that”.
One of the issues the government is considering is enforcement, Varadkar told the Dáil, though he indicated that it would not be applied to international travel.
At the moment the requirement for a person to restrict his or her movements having come in from abroad is not mandatory. Neither is it mandatory for a person to restrict his or her movements if he or she is a close contact, explained Varadkar, stating that that is a much higher risk than international travel.
“Consequently, one thing we are giving consideration to as a Government is whether we need to make mandatory and make legally enforceable the requirement for a person to restrict his or her movements or self-isolate in certain circumstances,” he said. 
However, he said it would “not make sense to apply that to international travel”, as it is actually a lower risk than somebody who is positive not self-isolating or somebody who is a close contact not restricting their movements.
“We need to be proportionate in that regard,” he said. 
While the Tánaiste said international travel is a risk, “we also need to be realistic about that too”, he said.
“We are an island country but we are not an island state. We share a land border with Northern Ireland that is wide open. There is a relatively liberal regime in Northern Ireland for international travel. There are no restrictions on travel to Britain and a very extensive green list, much more extensive than ours.
“We do not detect an appetite from the Northern Ireland Executive to change that. We need to be very realistic about that. We could have very strict rules at our airports but they could be made a mockery of by virtue of the fact that we have open travel with Northern Ireland which obviously we are not going to restrict,” he said. 
As reported by TheJournal.ie last week, from midnight on 8 November, the government is planning that the requirement for those arriving from orange locations to restrict their movements is due to be waived, if they have a negative test result up to three days before arrival.

While the current requirement for a person to restrict their movements for 14 days following arrival from a ‘red’ region remains until further notice, the Government is planning that as soon as it is practicable, this requirement can be waived following a negative result from an approved Covid-19 test taken five days after arrival.

Testing requirements for arrivals from red countries will be in place “in a matter of weeks”, according Transport Minister Eamon Ryan.
Speaking before a Oireachtas committee yesterday, he confirmed testing for departures from Ireland could be rolled out in a matter of weeks.
Speaking about mandatory quarantine, Ryan said we don’t have such a system and it would be very difficult to roll out such a system. 
“Our system is compliance based system,” he said. Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan previously recommended that all arrivals from international flights should be held in state facilities for 14 days – something the government ruled out early in the pandemic. 
Pre-departure test requirements from amber and red areas is aimed at reducing the risk of the virus being reseeded into the country, Varadkar said today.
He said testing is going to be particularly important” given that as we get the numbers down the risk of reseeding becomes higher and we want to avoid that”.
Varadkar said the government is “very much advising people that we are in a Level 5 period. Under level 5 restrictions a person is not supposed to go more that 5 km from his or her home, except for work, education or compassionate reasons such as caring for a relative. That applies to international travel too, so if people are travelling internationally it should only be for work, education or a compassionate reason which may involve, for example, having to care for a relative,” he said.

The new system, which applies to regions rather than country, determines the rules around foreign travel.
Social Democrats co-leaders Catherine Murphy said in the absence of testing at ports and airports, “we are effectively taking a fingers-crossed approach”. 
Speaking about Level 5, Varadkar said “we are saying very definitely is that Level 5 is for six weeks”.
“We want to get the number of cases down as low as possible before considering the state of restrictions. We don’t have a decision yet to tell people what level we move to on 1 December.

Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill ruled after defence lawyers had argued that pretrial publicity had made it impossible for the four men to get a fair trial.
They had also cited an 11 September hearing in which the men and their lawyers were confronted by angry protesters outside the courthouse, saying it showed that holding the proceeding in the same area where Floyd died would be unsafe for participants.
Defence lawyers had argued that witnesses could be intimidated, and jurors could be affected by chants from a crowd outside.
Moving the trial away from Minneapolis to less diverse areas of the state likely would have affected the make-up of the jury.
Cahill said he would revisit the ruling if needed.
Defence lawyers had also argued that the men should face separate trials, as each officer tried to diminish their own role in Floyd’s arrest by pointing fingers at the other.
But Cahill rejected that too, saying the complications of separate trials were too great and that trying the officers together would “ensure that the jury understands … all of the evidence and the complete picture of Floyd’s death”.
Floyd, a Black man in handcuffs, died on 25 May after Derek Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck as he said he could not breathe.
Floyd’s death sparked protests in Minneapolis and beyond, and led to a nationwide reckoning on race.

The case has been brought by Abdul Malik Bekmirzaev, who is currently living with his mother Iryna Paltarzhytskaya in her native Belarus.
The boy’s proceedings arise over the State’s refusal to re-issue him with an Irish passport or recognised as being an Irish citizen, which he claims is incorrect and in breach of his rights.
That decision came after the State retrospectively revoked the naturalisation certificate granted to his father Alexandr Bekmirzaev, who it is alleged joined ISIS in Syria. He is missing and his family fear he is dead.
Alexandr Bekmirzaev became a naturalised Irish citizen in 2010, based on his marriage to an EU citizen in 2001, who he divorced prior to obtaining his citizenship.
The boy’s Irish citizenship was based on his father’s naturalisation.
The boy’s lawyers say they learned from media reports in August that Bekmirzaev’s citizenship had been revoked on the basis that his 2001 marriage was one of convenience.
Earlier this year the boy brought separate judicial review proceedings challenging the Minister for Foreign Affairs’ failure to make a decision whether to renew the boy’s Irish passport.
That action was resolved between the parties in June, but no new passport was issued, it is claimed.
In September the State informed Abdul that it was not issuing him with a new passport and did not consider him a citizen because his father’s citizenship had been revoked.
Despite being asked to on several occasions the state also refused to furnish the boy’s lawyers with a copy of the revocation without a letter of authority from Alexandr Bekmirzaev.
As a result of the refusal, the boy has brought proceedings against the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ireland and the Attorney General.
The boy, represented by Michael Lynn SC with Colin Smith Bl, instructed by solicitor Wendy Lyon, seeks various orders and declarations from the court including an order that the boy is issued with an Irish passport.
He also seeks declarations that the decision to revoke his father’s citizenship does not have retrospective effect nor effect Abdul’s citizenship and that the boy is an Irish citizen.
The boy’s lawyers claim the refusal breaches both his Constitutional rights and his rights under the European Convention of Human Rights.
The revocation of his father’s Irish citizenship was not carried out in accordance with law it is further argued.

The court also heard that boy and his mother were deported to Belarus from a refugee camp Turkey in January, and want to return to Ireland.
Alexandr Bekmirzaev, who converted in Islam in the 1990s, came to Ireland from Belarus in 1999.
He married a British national in 2001, which enabled him to obtain Irish citizenship. After that marriage ended in early 2010, the boy’s parents were married.
Bekmirzaev departed for ISIS-controlled Syria, to allegedly fight for ISIS, shortly after his son’s birth in Dublin in April 2013. The family reunited in Syria in 2014 where they lived, until the ISIS ‘caliphate’s defeat in 2018.
Bekmiraev was imprisoned following his capture by Kurdish soldiers, while his son and wife were moved to various camps in Syria and Turkey. The boy’s Irish passport was confiscated by the Turkish authorities, prompting his application for a renewal.
The action came before Justice Tara Burns today who on an ex parte basis granted the boy permission to bring his challenge. The matter will return before the court next month.","The boy’s Irish citizenship was based on his father’s naturalisation which was retrospectively revoked by the State.",14,0,1,25162,"Nov 5th 2020, 3:48 PM"

McGoldrick – Ireland’s Player of the Year in 2019 and outstanding in the Euro 2020 play-off defeat to Slovakia last month – called time on his international career yesterday.
McGoldrick will be 35 by the time the 2022 World Cup swings around and has made the call to focus on his club career with Sheffield United and spend more time with his family. 
“It wasn’t really a shock to me. It was always his intention to retire at the end of the campaign”, said Kenny. “He’s a great guy, David. He was a very popular member of the squad. I would have liked for him to stay on and have a positive impact on all the young attacking players coming through.
“I felt he could have had an impact, but he has his reasons and I respect his reasons. That’s the way life is.” 
Asked whether McGoldrick might answer an SOS call in the future, Kenny laughed and said, “You’ll have to ask him that. You never know.”
The Irish manager then hinted that McGoldrick’s recent spell out of the Sheffield United team after injury against Slovakia partly prompted his decision. 
“It was always his intention to retire. He can speak for himself, but obviously he had an injury he played with in Slovakia – the adductor injury – and I think it affected his training and he subsequently lost his place at Sheffield United because his training programme was affected, and he hasn’t started the last few games there. 
“He is a private man and he has his own reasons, and we have to respect that.”
Kenny today named a 26-man squad for next week’s friendly with England along with subsequent Nations League games with Wales and Bulgaria.
Kenny started each of last month’s trio of games with a different central striker, but none have been included in this squad. McGoldrick has retired, while Shane Long and Sean Maguire have not made the cut. 
Instead, Luton Town striker James Collins has earned his first call up under Kenny – Collins has scored five goals for Luton thus far this season – with Ronan Curtis and Daryl Horgan keeping their places having been late call-ups from the previous squad. 
Stephen Kenny speaks to the Irish press over Zoom this afternoon.

Ireland have scored just once in five games under Kenny so far – a Shane Duffy header from a set-piece in the opening game against Bulgaria – but the Irish manager today stressed the positives of those performances when the issue was raised today. 
“I think you have to look at each of the games in isolation. I think the performance against Slovakia was a really good performance. Away from home, and we dominated the game. The other games, you cannot just erase the fact that eight players were not available because of Covid tracing. That’s not making excuses. You have to accept criticism if you don’t score goals and I am willing to do that. 
“We only conceded four goalscoring chances over the three games. There were two chances in the game against Slovakia – Darren made a save from a counter attack from our own corner and Shane Duffy cleared one off the line – we didn’t concede any chances against Wales at all and Finland hardly anything, a couple.

“And we probably created 15 chances in the three games. We are creating chances, we are playing well, and we haven’t taken them.” 
Kenny praised the potential of Adam Idah, Aaron Connolly, Callum Robinson and Troy Parrott, with the latter expected to be named in the Irish U21 squad tomorrow after an injury lay-off. 
And while he lamented the loss of McGoldrick, he said it offers Aaron Connolly a chance to play centrally, his preferred position having spent much of the Kenny era so far playing off the left.
Ireland have hardly scored under Kenny and they have yet to win, though that fact is not unduly worrying the manager. 
For example, Bulgaria play Gibraltar in their first friendly – we could have looked to get a really lowly-ranked team at home, tried to get some goals under our belt and get a victory and just park that, and it parks that question. But we didn’t. We’ve taken on England. Does that make sense to do that? Are people going to go on about win/game ratios in friendlies and things like that? Is that important?
“Really I’m looking for the team to develop. We’ve taken on the England game because we don’t fear anyone.” 
Kenny sees the England game as a chance for Ireland to improve ahead of next year’s World Cup qualifiers, the draw for which will be made on 7 December. Ireland are currently second seeds in that draw, but may be usurped and fall to third, with seeding contingent on results across the November window. 
“I can’t get fixated on the minutiae of World Cup seeding points”, said Kenny. “We just have to focus on playing well against England, against Wales after that quick Thursday/Sunday turnaround, and then the game against Bulgaria in Dublin on Wednesday.” 
An added benefit to the England game, said Kenny, is a chance to beat them for only the third time in Irish football history. The most recent win over England was at Euro ’88, with Kenny pointing out Darren Randolph was the only member of his squad alive at the time of that game. 
James McCarthy and Seamus Coleman have both been named in the Irish squad in spite of recent injuries, though Kenny says both are expected to be fit to link up with the squad in London on Sunday. 
The squad will be based in the UK until they fly home for the Bulgaria game in Dublin on 18 November. 
Jack Byrne will miss the England game but will link up ahead of the Wales game, likely after Shamrock Rovers’ FAI Cup quarter-final with Finn Harps.

1142,215,"From Sharpies to 'dumped ballots': The misinformation being shared about voting in the US",https://www.thejournal.ie/misinformation-about-voting-5256071-Nov2020/,"MISINFORMATION HASN’T JUST been a feature of the US presidential election campaigns, but is also haunting the already grueling counting in a handful of states yet to declare for a US presidential candidate.  
Here are some of the main claims that are doing the rounds and have been cleared up by US officials, so that you can separate fact from widely-shared social media claims.
Claim 1
Donald Trump sent this tweet claiming that there have been “a large number of secretly dumped ballots” in Michigan, a tweet which has since been flagged by Twitter:
We have claimed, for Electoral vote purposes, the commonwealth of Pennsylvania (which won’t allow legal observers) the state of Georgia, and the state of North Carolina, each one of which has a BIG Trump lead. 
Additionally, we hereby claim the state of Michigan if, in fact there was a large number of secretly dumped ballots as has been widely reported!
Source: Donald Trump
The origins of this claim seem to come from a screenshot taken of an interactive election map. The screenshot was taken by republican consultant Matt Mackowiak.
He said that it appeared over 128,000 new votes were counted and all went to Biden, which would be suspicious. Trump shared the tweet and said, “what is this all about?”
The site where the map was from, Decision Desk HQ, said that this was a typo based on a “clerical error” made while updating their Electoral map, and was fixed once they realised the error – around 30 minutes later.
An elections clerk told The New York Times that “all it was is there was an extra zero that got typed in”. Instead of saying that Biden’s unofficial tally was 15,371, they put in 153,710.
Decision Desk HQ said: “This morning there was a clerical error in the Shiawassee, MI county presidential data. Once we identified the error, we cleared the erroneous data and updated it with the correct data as provided by officials.”
Mackowiak later deleted his tweet, saying that it was meant in good faith. 
The claim seems to have spurred on other accusations of electoral fraud in Michigan, however, that are still reverberating: other claims are now being made on Twitter, mostly by Trump supporters and claimed without evidence:
Over 500 mail in ballots for Trump found dumped at Marysville Precinct in Michigan. [Twitter]
Claim 2
Donald Trump is repeatedly claiming that his shrinking leads in some states is down to ballots ‘being found’ and added to the tally:
They are working hard to make up 500,000 vote advantage in Pennsylvania disappear – ASAP. Likewise, Michigan and others!
They are finding Biden votes all over the place — in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. So bad for our Country!
Important context to note on this issue: stronger support for Trump was expected early on, as the first votes of the US Presidential election were counted.
This is because the in-person votes were going to be counted first, and this cohort of voters tend to be Republicans. This Rep-Dem divide was only amplified further by the coronavirus pandemic, with more Democrats expected to send in mail-in or absentee ballots.
Trump’s tweets seem to show the President attempting to rationalise the ‘blue shift’ as a fraud because he can’t understand that there are party-aligned patterns associated with ballots that depend on what area they are from and how the votes were cast.
This tweet from Trump seems to support this: “How come every time they count Mail-In ballot dumps they are so devastating in their percentage and power of destruction?”

Claim 3
Yesterday, Donald Trump’s son Eric tweeted out “Burning 80 Trump Ballots” with a link to another tweet with a video. The tweet has been shared over 30,000 times.
The video showed a plastic bag filled with pieces of paper that appeared to be ballots, and a man saying “all Trump… you gotta do what you gotta do… fuck Trump”. He then lights the ballots on fire and flips his middle finger.

This video has also been widely shared on Facebook.

Officials from Virginia Beach, a city in southeast Virginia released a statement about the video, which apparently happened in their district:

Claim 4
‘Sharpiegate’ is another allegation made in states such as Arizona and Michigan.
What’s being alleged is that election officials are giving voters ‘Sharpies’, which is a brand of marker, to fill in their election ballot. But when they go to a machine to have their vote scanned, it’s claimed that it doesn’t register the vote. 
Here’s a voter in Arizona explaining her experience:
There were two people who were in front of me that used a Sharpie that was given to them by the poll workers. It did not read their ballot, and they slotted it in their twice. I used a pen, took their Sharpie and threw it away, and it read my ballot.

When asked if they were being given Sharpies on purpose so it would not read their ballot, she answered “Yes”.
In the US, voters use ‘tabulation’ machines in some areas of some states to arrange ballots for either or candidate.
Arizona election officials told the Associated Press that Sharpies were used in voting, but they said that would not invalidate a ballot. 
Maricopa County Elections Department (in Arizona) tweeted on 3 November:
Did you know we use Sharpies in the Vote Centers so the ink doesn’t smudge as ballots are counted onsite? New offset columns on the ballots means bleed through won’t impact your vote!
Clint Hickman, the Republican chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, and Steve Gallardo, the board’s only Democrat, published a letter to voters expressing concern about misinformation.
They said officials tested a wide variety of pens with their vote-tabulation equipment and “Sharpies are recommended by the manufacturer because they provide the fastest-drying ink.” They also said that Sharpies do not invalidate ballots.

In correspondence with Dublin City Council, the developers said they had told the council of the planned demolition on 15 September and that it was “not clear” what conditions in the planning permission had not been complied with.
They also said that a commencement notice had been returned by the council and confirmed “deemed valid” with an instruction only that work should not take place before 29 September – the day the house was knocked down.
The developers also warned that demolition work on the site had not been properly finished and that it was not “best practice” to leave the work unfinished.
In an email to council officials, they wrote: “Your instruction has interrupted work that is part complete only. In our demolition waste management plans, we commit to source separate material on site and arrange for collection and removal of waste by authorised contractors.
“We consider it best practice and sensible to complete the work, but will refrain from doing so pending clarification from you about the precise issues that you believe to require further attention.”
They said that the demolition had taken place “in accordance with all applicable laws” but that the demolition contractor immediately ceased work on the request of the council.
The destruction of the house in Dublin’s Ballsbridge proved highly controversial, as it was the home of Michael Joseph O’Rahilly, the only leader to have been killed during battle in the 1916 Rising.
Dublin city councillors have sought the reconstruction of the house and the council has initiated legal proceedings against Derryroe Ltd under the building control acts.
Correspondence released by Dublin City Council shows how an official emailed the developers on 29 September confirming works should stop at once.
“I spoke on site with [name redacted] who was in charge,” it said, “he has undertaken to cease all works immediately and he and his team have left the site.”
The following morning, a representative of the developers responded to confirm that the demolition contractor had stopped all work, and sought further information.

An email from the council’s planning enforcement manager said they wanted to make clear that no work should have taken place and that an enforcement notice would be put in place.
In response, the developers said: “It is a matter for your discretion, I appreciate, but [I] ask you to consider whether, in that circumstance, an enforcement notice is in fact necessary or appropriate.”
They said they would be happy to deal with any “outstanding matters” but that it would be “helpful to understand” what conditions in the permission for demolition and site clearance needed further attention.
The council answered to say they felt an enforcement notice was required to ensure that no further works would take place.
“These works should not have been carried out until all ‘prior to commencement’ conditions were complied with which includes sign off approval by Dublin City Council,” said their planning enforcement manager.

Judge Marie Quirke acceded to the DPP’s request to make the return for trial order. She directed that the youth’s case was being sent forward for trial at the Central Criminal Court.
Earlier, Garda Eanna Murphy told the court the teen replied, “I did not rape her,” to two of the charges.
His reply to the third charge was, “she let me finger her”.
The Children’s Court does not have jurisdiction to hear the case due to the nature of the charge.

Some roles at Caterpillar in the Antrim town of Larne may be outsourced to India and employees’ representatives dubbed it a “scandalous profit grab” at the expense of local staff.
Unite the union’s George Brash said some people had spent 30 years with the generator-building firm.
He said: “They are absolutely devastated that in the midst of a pandemic what we are looking at is jobs lost in the mouth of Christmas.”
The process is expected to be completed within 18 months and is designed to ensure the competitive future of the multinational firm.
Consultations with workers’ unions begin next week.
The announcement is part of the company’s plans to better utilise existing capacity and improve cost competitiveness.
Managers said the proposal was unrelated to Brexit or Covid-19.
Brash said: “That is families, that is Larne, that is the wider community that is going to take a hit.
“They are angry that potentially jobs could be outsourced to foreign countries.”
The union’s regional officer said the workforce was highly skilled and motivated and added it would be unacceptable if some of the positions were moved to India.
He hoped there would be opportunities for redeployment or alternative work.
“They are on a slippery slope when there are 700 jobs at risk.
“The fear for the workers is that this is just the first of other announcements.”
Larne is a port town and major industrial base in East Antrim.
Northern Ireland has lost a host of manufacturing jobs in recent years including a major tyre manufacturer in the wider Antrim area.

Stormont assembly member John Stewart said Caterpillar’s announcement had come completely out of the blue and caused deep worry locally.

“To take 700 workers out of this small, average-sized town of Larne will have a huge impact, that is undoubtedly the case and there are a lot of people really fearful about what the future will bring in terms of that.”
Caterpillar is an Illinois-based heavy machinery maker working in areas like mining.
Its manufacturing facility in Springvale in Belfast will not be affected by the job cuts.
The total number of employees in the North is currently about 1,600.
Joe Creed, vice president of Caterpillar’s electric power division, said: “We recognise that what we are considering is difficult for our employees, their families and the community.
“We do not take these contemplations lightly; however, we must plan for future business needs to be competitive.”
Mayor of Mid and East Antrim council, Councillor Peter Johnston, said they were working closely with the firm and would do everything they could to support those affected.

The sharing of an agreement negotiated between the Government and the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) to a rival GP group last year was raised again today by Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty during Leaders’ Questions.
The Donegal TD said that Dr Maitiú Ó Tuathail was thrown under the bus by Varadkar, and then he “reversed over him”, referencing reports that Varadkar told his parliamentary party meeting last night that people should be careful who their friends are.
Ó Tuathail was fully entitled to ask for the IMO document, said Doherty, stating that he has done nothing wrong. However, Varadkar should not have provided it to him, Doherty said.
Varadkar said he has already accepted responsibility for the matter. 
Earlier this week, Varadkar apologised in the Dáil for “errors of judgement” after he was grilled about what motivated him to send the document to Dr Ó Tuathail of the NAGP – someone Varadkar said is a friend but “not a close friend”.
Today, Sinn Féins Pearse Doherty said he did not accept the Tánaiste’s claim that the talks had concluded, and that only minor changes were made to the IMO agreement after it was shared with Dr Ó Tuathail.
Doherty says he counted 35 changes to the document. The Tanaiste said he could not attest to that as he did not know what document Doherty was working off, and he doesn’t have a copy of the agreement sent to Dr Ó Tuathail.

He said he did not have details of his correspondence relating to the leaked GP contract documents because he does not keep his text messages.
Varadkar told the Dail the reason he no longer has the 2019 WhatsApp messages between him and Dr Ó Tuathail was because he does not usually retain his texts.

He said he had to contact Dr Ó Tuathail to establish that they had been in contact about the contract between the 11-16 April 2019.

While six states are still awaiting a result, some will be done sooner than others, and the battleground states of Pennsylvania and North Carolina will be counting votes for several days yet.

As the day wore on the incumbent’s lead of around 600,000 votes was cut in half and the race has tightened further today to around 165,000. State election officials say it could take several more days for the “overwhelming majority” of the votes to be counted.
A similar situation prevails in North Carolina, where Trump holds a lead of just over 1% with 95% of the votes reported. Despite the endline seemingly being in sight, officials in the state have said they won’t be announcing more results until next week.
Why is this taking so long?
Holding an election amidst a pandemic brought a host of new challenges and some US states have proven more adept at handling them than others.
Absentee voting smashed all previous records this year with around 100 million voters casting their ballot ahead of polling day.
In some states, like Florida, the process worked very well as counters were able to tot up early votes as they were received.
State law prevented this from happening in Pennsylvania, meaning officials weren’t allowed to start processing ballots until 7am on election day. Efforts to start counting early were blocked by Pennsylvania’s Republican-controlled legislature.
Florida has a long tradition of early voting, due to its large elderly population and its susceptibility to hurricanes. No such tradition previously existed in Pennsylvania but this year the state received 2.6 million mail-in ballots. Officials say that’s 10 times the amount of absentee ballots that are cast during a normal election.
The Keystone State is also allowing mail-in votes to be received up until tomorrow if they were postmarked by Election Day. This has become a bone of contention for the Trump campaign which is desperately clinging on to its narrow lead in the crucial state.

The campaign said it would challenge late-arriving mail-in ballots at the Supreme Court. However, the votes are unlikely to change the result in the state as election officials have said that only a few hundred late votes have been received. 
Nine Pennsylvania counties further added to the delays by deciding not to start counting mail-in ballots until Wednesday.
With approximately 90% of the vote reported this afternoon (Irish time) Trump’s lead was down to around 165,000 votes, a margin of 1.6%.

North Carolina
Trump also claimed to have won North Carolina, which is a must-win for him if he is to retain the White House. In reality the race is currently too-close to call with about 117,000 mail-in votes left to count. 
In a pattern that has played out across the US, Biden is outperforming Trump in mail-in votes, meaning the remaining ballots could flip the state in his favour. That result would represent only the second time North Carolina has backed a Democrat for president since 1976.
The southeastern state has an even longer period for accepting mail-in ballots, counting them if they are received before 12 November (next Thursday) as long as they are post marked by 3 November.
Another unknown is how many provisional ballots were recorded. These are ballots where a question mark hangs over the voter’s eligibility that needs to be resolved before it counts.
The issues can crop up for a number of reasons including the voter’s name not appearing on the electoral role or the voter not having identification.
In the 2016 election North Carolina recorded 61,000 provisional ballots and around 27,000 of these ended up being counted. Officials said that the total number of provisional ballots will be known later today.
North Carolina doesn’t appear to be in any rush to finish the count as the state has signaled that it’s not likely to report any additional results until next week.
“With very few exceptions, North Carolina’s numbers are not going to move until 12 or 13 November,” the head of the State Board of Elections, Karen Brinson Bell, said.
Thankfully the outcome in the election will likely be called much sooner than that. ","Unsurprisingly, Covid-19 has played its part in the delay.",8,0,0,20256,"Nov 5th 2020, 2:04 PM"

Overall, Radio 1′s share of the Irish radio market has grown from 22.6% to 24.1% in the past year, with listeners flocking to current affairs programming during the pandemic.
Results at its music-heavy sister station, 2FM, were less positive across the board with listeners switching the dial to more news-oriented fare.
Meanwhile, programmers at Today FM will be celebrating after gaining listeners across its weekday schedule.
Radio listening throughout the market was down before 8am, but up after 8am, according to the latest research.
Mid-morning shows like Today FM’s Dermot and Dave and The Ryan Tubridy Show on RTÉ Radio One were some of the biggest beneficiaries of this trend, adding 19,000 and 47,00 listeners respectively.
RTÉ Radio One
Ireland’s most listened-to radio programme Morning Ireland has grown its audience to a whopping 491,000 listeners, an increase of 62,000 since September 2019.
It might be too early to say whether a new line-up has helped, however, with former Drivetime host Mary Wilson joining the team recently alongside Áine Lawlor, who left her long-time News at 1 gig.
Miriam O’Callaghan was the station’s biggest winner over the period, adding 82,000 to her audience. This took the number of people who tune into her Sunday morning offering to 318,000.
Another success story is the station’s mid-morning Today show, which had three presenters over the survey period – Sean O’Rourke, Sarah McInerney and most recently, Claire Byrne.

It now enjoys an audience of 369,000, up 54,000 year-on-year.
Liveline also had a positive 12 months, with an extra 41,000 listeners tuning into Joe Duffy every day — bringing its audience to 401,000.
RTÉ programmers believe that discussions on lighter topics like the sex scenes in Normal People coupled with more standard Liveline fare like the Leaving Cert debacle have helped to increase the show’s reach with a younger audience.
“We’re privileged to be trusted by so many in these different times. Thanks to the team, listeners, and our callers,” said Duffy.
Peter Woods, head of RTÉ Radio 1, said that the station’s success has something to do with listeners wanting to tune into trusted sources during a time of national crisis.
“People come to us as a trusted source of information around the country. That’s a good position to be in.
“But also, we’ve made changes and we’d like to think it’s the excellence of our programming,” he says.
2FM
With listeners flipping over to news programming, 2FM had a tough time of it over the past 12 months.
DJ Jenny Greene’s afternoon show pulled in 113,00 weekly listeners over the period, down 26,000 while the station’s weekday breakfast show, hosted by Doireann Garrihy and Eoghan McDermott lost 9,000 listeners.
Jennifer Zamparelli, who took over the famous Gerry Ryan slot, held up relatively well, losing just 4,000 listeners taking her total audience to 152,000.
Tracy Clifford’s music programme lost 12,000 listeners, going from 142,000 to 130,000.
John Healy, head of 2FM, says that when schools were shuttered in March, it meant fewer people turning on the radio in the mornings on their commute.

While he was prepared to leach some listeners to Radio 1 at a time of crisis when people want to keep up with all the latest developments, he says it’s a pity that there’s no JNLR survey this quarter.
“Kids are back travelling to schools and colleges. They’re all back but there’s no JNLR survey to measure them,” he says.
“But from a 2FM perspective, we’re just delighted with what’s going on with Radio 1 because we really admire their production process.”
Today FM
By contrast, programmers at the Communicorp-owned Today FM will be very pleased with the station’s performance over the survey period.
Overall, Today FM enjoyed its highest market share in five years at 7.8% and a weekly listenership of 877,000 — 100,000 more than nearest competitor 2FM.
Fergal D’Arcy’s mid-afternoon music programme bucked trends observed at 2FM, adding 22,000 listeners over the course of the survey period — the biggest increase of any Today FM show. 
Ed Smith’s National Anthems, another music programme, also increased its listenership to 27,000, up 4,000.
Ian Dempsey’s breakfast show meanwhile hit 179,000 listeners, adding 2,000 over the 12 month period.
But biggest winners for the station were Dermot Whelan and Dave Moore whose eponymous mid-morning offering hit 183,000 listeners, which was an increase of 19,000.
Commenting on the figures, Whelan said, “We’re so delighted with these JNLR figures.

1151,182,"What lawsuits has Trump's campaign team launched and why?",https://www.thejournal.ie/donald-trump-lawsuits-us-election-5256113-Nov2020/,"DONALD TRUMP’S CAMPAIGN team has filed lawsuits in a number of states as Joe Biden moves closer to being elected US President.
Trump’s team has filed legal challenges in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia and Nevada.
His team is demanding better access for campaign observers at centres where ballots are being counted. The team has also made unsubstantiated claims about mail-in and absentee ballots.
After securing victories in Wisconsin and Michigan, Biden has 264 electoral college votes and needs to secure one of Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina or his home state Pennsylvania to reach the necessary 270 to claim the country’s top position.
You can read the latest updates on the count in our liveblog here.
The Trump campaign filed a number of legal motions in Pennsylvania, including attempts to stop the vote count and allow Republican Party members observe the vote count.
The state’s Democratic governor, Tom Wolf, said Trump’s “attempts to subvert the democratic process are disgraceful”.
Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien said in a statement yesterday that the campaign would sue in Michigan to stop ballot counting until it can have more “meaningful access” to observe ballot processing and counting.
Michigan’s Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, insisted both parties and members of the public had been given access to the tallying, and that “all ballots are counted fairly and accurately”.
The state Republican Party and the Trump campaign have also sued in Georgia, asking a judge to remind election workers that under state law, late mail ballots — arriving after 7pm on election day — are not to be counted.  The lawsuit claims that late ballots may have been mixed with ballots that had arrived on time, but there is no proof of this.
The Nevada Supreme Court refused the Trump campaign’s effort on Monday night to halt mail ballot processing, allowing ballots be processed as planned on election day.
You can read a full breakdown of the lawsuits, by NBC News, here.
‘Admitting defeat is not plausible’
Some legal experts have said Trump’s lawsuits are an attempt to slow down Biden being elected, rather than being based on genuine legal concerns.
“Admitting defeat is not a plausible reaction so soon after the election, so they throw a lot of Hail Mary lawsuits at the wall and hope something sticks,” longtime Republican elections lawyer Ben Ginsberg told CNN.
Franita Tolson, a law professor and CNN contributor, agrees, saying: “I think much of the litigation is a longshot and unlikely to succeed.”
She said she believes “a big goal of this litigation is, in the short term, to change the narrative” from a potential Biden win to a conversation about fraud, even if those claims are not backed up by evidence.

Joe Biden: 'When the count is finished, we believe we will be the winners'
Marc Elias, Democrats’ top election attorney, yesterday tweeted that the Trump campaign’s lawsuits were “meritless”.
Protests
Trump supporters in some states have gathered to demand counts be stopped – while in others they are insisting all ballots be counted.
After the president claimed, without evidence, that mail-in ballots in states such as Michigan had fraudulently favoured opponent Biden, fans of Trump appeared at the TCF Center in Detroit shouting “let us in” and “stop the count”.
Local media reported raucous scenes as Republican counters attempted to enter the building, alleging they were being unfairly kept out – a claim denied by local Democrats also kept outside.
In contrast, pro-Trump demonstrators showed up at counts in Nevada and Arizona demanding that all votes be counted.
Outside the counting centre in Maricopa County, Phoenix, a crowd of Republican supporters, some armed with guns, gathered shouting “count the votes” and “Fox News sucks”, after the right-wing TV network earlier called Arizona in Biden’s favour.
Observers from both parties were inside the election centre as ballots were processed and counted, and the procedure was live-streamed online at all times.
Several police officers blocked the entrance to the building, and the vote-counting went on into the night, Maricopa County Elections Department spokeswoman Megan Gilbertson said.

Two top county officials — one a Democrat, the other a Republican — issued a statement expressing concern about how misinformation had spread about the integrity of the election process.
“Everyone should want all the votes to be counted, whether they were mailed or cast in person,” said the statement signed by Clint Hickman, the Republican chairman of Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, and Democratic supervisor Steve Gallardo. “An accurate vote takes time. This is evidence of democracy, not fraud.”
Meanwhile, thousands of Trump opponents took to the streets in cities across the US demanding a complete tally of ballots.
In Portland, Oregon, which has been a scene of regular protests for months, governor Kate Brown called out the National Guard as demonstrators engaged in what authorities said was widespread violence. Protesters in Portland were demonstrating about a range of issues, including police brutality and the counting of the vote.
“It’s important to trust the process, and the system that has ensured free and fair elections in this country through the decades, even in times of great crisis,” Brown said in a statement. “We are all in this together.”
In New York, hundreds of people paraded past boarded-up luxury stores on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue, and in Chicago, demonstrators marched along a street across the river from Trump Tower.
Similar protests — sometimes about the election, sometimes about racial inequality — took place in at least a half-dozen cities, including Los Angeles, Houston, Pittsburgh, Minneapolis and San Diego.

At the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting yesterday evening, the TD launched a scathing attack on the Taoiseach, stating that he was very unhappy with the way Martin and other Fianna Fáil ministers came out to bat for Varadkar.
During the meeting, MacSharry said he was disgusted at how Micheál Martin was ruining the party, and blamed him for the party’s poor performance in the polls.
MacSharry said he was “beyond disgust and depression at issues of the last number of days”, telling the Taoiseach that there was “palpable anger throughout the country” from party members to see Martin out “as chief flag flyer for Leo”.
MacSharry accused Martin of dragging the party down to 11% in the polls, stating “you need to accept you are part of the problem. Not the solution. At the moment you are the problem. I am disgusted with your conduct”.
Martin is understood to have retorted that MacSharry’s tone of criticism was very personal, in which the Sligo TD responded by stating that it was “not personal, but fact” and if he couldn’t take the criticism, he shouldn’t be leading the party.
Defending his comments today, MacSharry told RTÉ presenter Claire Byrne that the IMO agreement leak controversy was ”handled very very badly”.
Double standards
He said it is clear that the Taoiseach is now presiding “over a double standards, and there’s one rule for one, and no rules for others”, highlighting the case of Phil Hogan when was removed from office as a result of an inadvertent leak by one of his advisors to do with the budget a number of years ago.
MacSharry said now “we’re expected to judge this misdemeanor based on the track record of somebody, rather than for the breach”, adding that Leo Varadkar’s explanation of what happened when he gave a copy of an agreement negotiated between the Government and the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) to a rival GP group last year as a “fairy tale”.

“I think this particular issue over the course of the last week, does not sit well with me and indeed many people throughout the country, including something of our members who have been in contact with me about. I think business needs to be done differently. The issue needed to be raised, I raised it at the appropriate forum last night, and it’s a matter for the Taoiseach now to reflect on his own performance. Because things do need to improve,” he said.
Trust in politicians
He said trust of politicians nationally has been eroded through many issues over the years, and this has added to it.
“Consistency is paramount. Nobody is seeking, and I’m certainly not to have the guillotine set up in St Stephen’s Green for every misdemeanor,” he said, stating that perhaps there’s a role for the Standards and Public Office (Sipo) to do a book of quantum of sorts on what the sanction should be for particular breaches.
He said he took immediate issue with Martin when he said MacSharry was getting personal, with the Sligo TD stating this morning that there is “no need to be overly defensive about the facts”.

JOHNNY SEXTON HAS received the backing of head coach Andy Farrell following his petulant outburst in Paris last weekend.
Speaking to media this morning, Farrell was asked if he felt undermined by his captain’s reaction to being substituted during Saturday’s defeat in Paris. 
Sexton was captured on camera shaking his head in disgust following Farrell’s decision to take him off with 10 minutes to go, prompting criticism from former Ireland captains, Brian O’Driscoll and Keith Wood. In addition, Eddie O’Sullivan – the Ireland head coach from 2001 to 2008 – said Sexton’s reaction had undermined Farrell.
But Ireland coach Farrell is backing his captain, saying: “I don’t feel undermined at all. Not at all. It is a storm in a tea cup.”
Sexton responded: “I have apologised to the people who matter. I am disappointed in myself with (my) reaction to a certain extent.
“Obviously if I had known the stories that it was going to create and the way that it has been perceived then I would not have done it.
“But you have got to take it from my point of view – it was in the heat of the moment, I was involved in one the biggest games I have played in as captain – and it was obviously a low point. I reacted in a bad way for a split second.
I spoke to Andy after the game; I spoke to him on Sunday when I realised it was such a big thing and we sorted things out. I apologised. I said ‘look, it shouldn’t have happened. But it did. It was a split second thing. Obviously I let myself down in that regard’. But you learn and you move on.
“It is not the first apology I have made in my career and it won’t be the last.
“We will move on; we have a good relationship.”
Asked if the reaction was over-the-top, Sexton replied: “You don’t realise you are going to be on the big screen when you are substituted.
“Had someone said to me, ‘you’re going to be on the screen’ then I wouldn’t have done it.
“But when you are in the heat of battle, when you are playing an international, when you are captain of the team, you are disappointed in the performance as much as anything. There was as much disappointment in the situation (whereby Ireland were losing) as there was in the substitution.

“I am who I am. I have apologised to the people who matter but I am not going to sit here and sort of apologise to the whole world because it was a split-second thing, a split-second decision that I wish I didn’t make. But I did – so there you go.”
While Farrell is aware of how big a saga this has become, the Ireland head coach does not consider it a significant issue. “Johnny and I always have discussions, we constantly talk about how things are going with the group, we discuss everything, his individual game, his captaincy,” said Farrell.
Farrell and Sexton's relationship remains strong.

“He is a passionate guy and it is a reason we all love him as a player. So no, I don’t feel undermined and neither do the team.
“We need Johnny to be himself and there is always going to be learnings along the way but you are not going to change over night a person who has been at the top because of the intent and attitude he has got. We are always learning together.”
Asked if this was a storm in a tea cup, Farrell replied: “100 per cent. The last thing I want to do to Johnny is stop him being himself.”
And there seems little danger of that.
Sexton added: “I love being captain – it is the biggest honour of my career and I am trying to get better at the role, trying to seek out opinions and talk to the lads and talk to the management and see where I am going, whether I am doing a good enough job. I have dealt with things my whole career. I have reacted worse to be subbed off before.
“I’m not saying it is okay to do that – to react that way. Of course it isn’t okay, but at the same time, it is a split-second reaction. Normally the camera focuses on the player coming off not the player coming on but obviously my French (television) friends gathered my reaction.”","Ireland coach Farrell says he does not feel undermined by Sexton’s reaction last Saturday and insists the whole affair is a storm in a tea-cup.",2,0,0,41794,"Nov 5th 2020, 11:46 AM"

Thaci announced his resignation at a news conference today. 
He said he was taking the step “to protect the integrity of the presidency of Kosovo”.
Thaci was indicted by a Kosovo court based in The Hague which was set up to try alleged crimes of former ethnic Albanian rebel leaders.
A spokesman for the prosecutor in The Hague said he had no comment on Thaci’s announcement.
Thaci is one of several politicians who have been indicted for crimes that include murder, enforced disappearances, persecution and torture.
Among them is also a former parliament speaker, Kadri Veseli, who also said that he has been issued an indictment by a pre-trial judge and that he planned to travel to the The Hague today. 
Three other former commanders of the Kosovo Liberation Army that fought for independence from Serbia have been charged with war crimes by the court and an associated special prosecutor’s office established five years ago.
Exact details of the 10-count indictment against Thaci, Veseli and others have not been released.
Announcing the existence of the indictment earlier this year, the specialist prosecutor’s office alleged that Thaci and others were “criminally responsible for nearly 100 murders”.

At the time, the prosecutor’s office said it made the existence of the indictment public because of what it called repeated efforts by Thaci and Veseli “to obstruct and undermine” the work of the court and said they were believed to have tried to overturn the Kosovo law that created the court.
The formation of the court and prosecutor’s office followed a 2011 report by the Council of Europe, a human rights body, that included allegations that KLA fighters trafficked human organs taken from prisoners and killed Serbs and fellow ethnic Albanians.
The court is mandated to investigate and prosecute allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Kosovo, or linked to the Kosovo conflict, from 1998-2000.
The 1998-1999 war for independence from Serbia ended after a 78-day Nato air campaign against Serbian troops.
In 2008, Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia, something that Serbia has still not recognised.","The charges relate to his time as a guerrilla leader in the country’s war for independence.",3,0,0,14407,"Nov 5th 2020, 12:34 PM"

“Nobody – no politician, no elected official – should limit the people’s right to vote,” said Michael Georg Link, Special Co-ordinator and leader of the short-term OSCE observer mission.
“Coming after such a highly dynamic campaign, making sure that every vote is counted is a fundamental obligation for all branches of government,” he said. 
Trump, in the early hours of Wednesday as ballots were still being counted, declared “fraud” in the election with his teams since mounting a number of legal bids to stop counting in several states. 
Trump has a narrow path to a second term as it stands with Joe Biden currently carrying 264 electoral college votes against Trump’s 214. 
The OSCE sent 100 observers to more than 30 states to observe the presidential vote with the preliminary findings released late last night. This will be followed by a more comprehensive report early next year.
In its preliminary report, the OSCE described the early voting in the weeks leading up to the election as “competitive and well-managed” amid the coronavirus pandemic.
But the report raised concerns about campaign finances, drawn-out lawsuits and “acrimonious campaign rhetoric”.

The observers said the US media made efforts to provide accurate information on the organisation of elections, at times contrary to statements by candidates.
Observers also raised concerns regarding misinformation in the lead-up to the election.  
The report states: “Amidst growing public and legal scrutiny, major social media companies have adjusted policies and practices aimed to tackle disinformation, in particular in relation to elections, but concerns about the high level of disinformation spread via social networks remained.”  
Urszula Gacek, a former Polish diplomat who led the observers from the OSCE’s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, reserved the harshest criticism for incumbent President Trump who she said had attempted “to weaken confidence in the election process”. 
“The enormous effort made by election workers, supported by many engaged citizens, ensured that voters could cast their votes despite legal and technical challenges and deliberate attempts by the incumbent president to weaken confidence in the election process,” said Gacek.

“But this election is not over, and we remain here in DC and in key states around the country until it is. It is vital that every properly cast ballot is properly counted.”
The report also found that negative campaigning by “most candidates was frequently exacerbated by the misrepresentation of facts, especially from the incumbent president, thereby detracting from the ability of voters to accurately appraise the candidate’s views and qualifications.”

1159,193,"Austria admits security failings leading up to deadly Vienna shooting rampage",https://www.thejournal.ie/austria-security-failings-vienna-attack-5255898-Nov2020/,"AUSTRIA HAS ACKNOWLEDGED there had been security failings leading up to the deadly gun rampage in Vienna by a convicted Islamic State sympathiser.
Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said intelligence services had received a warning from neighbouring Slovakia that the assailant had tried to buy ammunition, but that “a failure of communication” had followed.
The gunman, identified as 20-year-old dual Austrian-Macedonian national Kujtim Fejzulai, was killed by police after going on a shooting spree in Vienna on Monday evening that left four people dead.
Police detained 14 people in the wake of the shooting, the first major attack in Austria for decades and the first blamed on a jihadist. 
They were “aged 18 to 28, from minority communities and some aren’t Austrian citizens,” Nehammer said.
Police say “it’s possible they supported” the gunman but their exact role remains unclear.
The authorities now say Fejzulai acted alone after initial fears more assailants could be at large.
Fejzulai had been convicted and sentenced to 22 months in prison in April last year for trying to travel to Syria and join the Islamic State (IS) group.
But he was released on probation in December and had been referred to organisations specialising in de-radicalisation programmes.
IS – which has claimed numerous attacks in Europe – said on Tuesday a “soldier of the caliphate” was responsible for the shooting.
‘Unsafe situation’
The gunman opened fire indiscriminately in the historic centre of the city just hours before Austria imposed a coronavirus lockdown, when people were out in bars and restaurants enjoying a final night of relative freedom.
Security has been tightened in the city. Flowers and candles were laid out at the scene of the attack, where chalk circles drawn on the ground by investigators to mark out shell casings were still visible.
But life was returning to normal – albeit under the new virus restrictions.
“We were scared by this terrorist act of course, but the city remains safe,” said Peter Mensdorff Pouilly, an architect. 
We are not going to be brought down by terrorism.
Nehammer told reporters that the BVT domestic intelligence agency had been warned by Slovakia that Fejzulai was attempting to buy ammunition.
“In the next steps there was clearly a failure of communication,” Nehammer said.
He accused his far-right predecessor Herbert Kickl of being responsible for failings in the way the BVT operates during his one-and-a-half years in office until May 2019.
Nehammer said he wanted a commission set up to look at the functioning of the intelligence agencies.
Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has described the decision to release Fejzulai as “definitely wrong”.

“If he had not been released then the terror attack would not have been possible,” Kurz told public broadcaster ORF on Tuesday.
‘Why didn’t they notice?’
Austria’s top security chief Franz Ruf told local media that at his last session of a publicly-funded de-radicalisation programme in late October, Fejzulai had condemned the recent jihadist attacks in France.
Nehammer has said the attacker successfully “fooled” the programmes, and that raids at his home revealed plentiful evidence of his radical views.
He referred to a Facebook post in which Fejzulai posed with the Kalashnikov and the machete he used in the attack, together with IS slogans.
“Nobody would have thought him capable of something like this,” Nikolaus Rast, the lawyer who represented Fejzulai last year, told AFP yesterday.
He also raised questions about possible oversights by the de-radicalisation programmes Fejzulai had attended.
“Without wanting to put the blame on someone, if they are the experts, why didn’t they notice anything?” Rast said.
“They must have had the most – and the last – contact with him.”
The organisation running the programmes, DERAD, hit back at the criticism, insisting that it had never described Fejzulai as “de-radicalised”.
The investigation is spanning several countries, with Switzerland making two arrests and North Macedonia, where Fejzulai has family roots, cooperating with Austrian authorities.

Swiss prosecutors said the two young men arrested were already the target of criminal cases for terrorism offences.
Kurz on Tuesday called for an EU response to “political Islam”, saying the ideology was “dangerous” for European freedoms and values.
A planned visit to Vienna by French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday to discuss the battle against terrorism and “political Islam” was downgraded to a video conference, Macron’s office said last night.
The recent re-publication of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in France has caused new tensions worldwide, sparking protests in some Muslim-majority countries and calls from several terror groups for their followers to take revenge. 
France itself has seen a deadly assault on churchgoers in the Mediterranean city of Nice and the beheading of a schoolteacher near Paris.

DOZENS OF SUPPORTERS of President Donald Trump chanting “Stop the count!” descended on a vote-tallying centre in Detroit last night as Americans on both political sides vented their anger and frustration over the undecided presidential contest at protests around the country.
The Detroit protests started soon before The Associated Press declared Democratic candidate Joe Biden had won Michigan.
Video shot by local media showed angry people gathered outside the TCF Centre and inside the lobby, with police officers lined up to keep them from entering the counting area. They chanted “Stop the count!” and “Stop the vote!”
In New York City, by contrast, thousands marched past boarded-up luxury stores on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue calling for every vote to be tallied.
The march was largely peaceful, though police made at least 20 arrests after a smaller, rowdier group began protesting police misconduct.

In Chicago, protesters demanding a complete count marched through downtown and along a street across the river from Trump Tower.
Similar protests — sometimes about the election, sometimes about racial inequality — took place in at least a half-dozen cities, including Los Angeles, Seattle, Houston, Pittsburgh, Minneapolis and San Diego.
Michigan has been on edge for months over fears of political violence. Anti-government protesters openly carried guns into the state Capitol during protests over coronavirus restrictions in the spring, and six men were arrested last month on charges of plotting to kidnap Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer.
Earlier, the Republican campaign filed suit in a bid to stop the count, demanding Michigan’s Democratic secretary of state allow in more inspectors.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, insisted both parties and the public had been given access to the tallying “using a robust system of checks and balances to ensure that all ballots are counted fairly and accurately”.
Scattered protests broke after voting ended last night, stretching from Washington DC to Seattle, but there was no widespread unrest or significant violence.
In Portland, Oregon, Richard March came to an anti-Trump protest despite a heart condition that makes him vulnerable to Covid-19.
“To cast doubt on this election has terrible consequences for our democracy,” he said. “I think we are a very polarised society now — and I’m worried about what’s going to come in the next days and weeks and months.” 
The prolonged task of counting this year’s deluge of mail-in votes raised fears that the lack of clarity in the presidential race could spark conflict.

The Cloyne Report and Murphy Report are just two of these watershed tomes, and another is on the way in the coming months.
The government has received a copy of the findings from the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes, but it has already attracted significant controversy before it has even come near to being published, as fears were sparked among survivor and campaign groups that the records would be sealed for 30 years.
There has been a significant back-and-forth on this, filled with legalese and conflicting statements, as well as some very powerful testimony from those with direct experience of mother and baby homes being read in the Dáil record.
To set the record straight on what happened, and what will happen over the coming months, Sinéad O’Carroll is joined this by our reporter Órla Ryan, co-director of the Clann Project and NUI Galway lecturer in human rights Dr Maeve O’Rourke, as well as solicitor and director of Data Compliance Europe Simon McGarr.

1162,186,"'Twice I woke up and a person was dead beside me'",https://www.thejournal.ie/merchants-quay-annual-report-2019-mental-health-5254921-Nov2020/,"DAVID BECAME HOMELESS in his early thirties after two bouts of cancer during his twenties that he says “knocked him sideways”. 
The cancer had “destroyed” his confidence, and he started using drugs to cope with his mental health issues. 
“I managed for the first couple of years. I had my own place, I was working. I had money saved up for a deposit on a house. And then things just spiralled out of control,” David recalls in Merchant Quay Ireland’s 2019 annual report, being launched today. 
“It got bad very quickly. I lost people around me, my job and my girlfriend. All those things vanished.”
David spent years sleeping in hostels and doorways around Dublin city centre, twice waking up next to someone who had died. 
I was going out of my head and taking drugs just to survive on the streets. I wanted to get help years ago but when you’re in addiction, you just can’t reach out and grab it. I couldn’t even talk to anyone about it, that’s how alone I felt.
Eventually, David turned to Merchants Quay Ireland for support, “that’s what kept me holding on I suppose”.
“Being able to come to Riverbank for a shower and something to eat kept me together. And the help I got there from the staff, the support they gave me when I needed it most.” 
David later started taking methadone after a spell in the hospital with septicaemia in his foot. From there he went on to detox at MQI’s St Francis Farm Residential Rehab and Detox Centre in Tullow.
“As soon as I arrived at St Francis Farm, I felt safe. I felt people understood me. The staff can relate to how people’s problems start. It’s like unravelling a knot.”
The main thing with me is sorting out my mental health, just accepting myself for who I am. I got a lot of stuff out during the one-to-one counselling. Being off drugs in rehab and doing all this work, it’s like I’ve just been reborn.
David says he has started rebuilding relationships with his family in the last couple of months and is determined to make a nice life for himself. 
Without the support that MQI gave him, he says he would probably “be in the ground”
Annual review 
Merchants Quay Ireland said it saw an 11% increase in individuals seeking help for mental health issues last year, supporting 433 people during a total of 4,208 mental health interventions.  
According to MQI’s annual review for 2019, it had 11,600 people in need come through its doors and experienced a rise in the number of people availing of its services across the board. 
The charity provides homeless outreach and drug rehabilitation services at every level of addiction. Its day centre on Merchants Quay in Dublin’s south inner city provides food, medical and counselling support for at-risk and homeless people.
In 2019, MQI’s Riverbank Centre provided 109,010 meals to people who are homeless – an increase of 6% on 2018 figures – while it’s Night Café provided emergency shelter for 1,677 people.

Speaking ahead of the launch of today’s report, MQI chief executive Paula Byrne said the charity has seen a marked increase in mental health interventions amongst vulnerable people – and the Covid-19 pandemic has made a bad situation worse.
“During this pandemic, life is especially difficult for people who are homeless, who must endure greater isolation than ever before as day services across the city are restricted due to the impact of Covid-19. Many of our clients are outside all day, in all weather, with nowhere to go indoors for a warm meal, a shower, or a comforting conversation,” she said. 
“There is no doubt that this social isolation and increased hardship is having a negative impact on our clients’ mental health. This is further compounded by how challenging it is to deliver mental health services safely during this crisis. There is a very real risk that some people will fall through the cracks this winter.”
Latest figures from the Department of Housing show that 8,656 people were in emergency accommodation in Ireland in September, including 6,073 adults and 2,583 children. 
Last year, 112 people accessed MQI’s family support services in Dublin and the Midlands, while 564 young people, aged 18 to 25, were supported by the team. 
A total of 181 were people admitted to the charity’s detox and rehab. David was one of those individuals. ","Over 11,600 people who are homeless or in addiction were helped by Merchants Quay Ireland in 2019.",15,0,0,32426,"Nov 5th 2020, 6:45 AM"
1163,191,"Players' lack of game time a concern with Kenny set to announce squad for November games",https://www.the42.ie/stephen-kenny-23-5253473-Nov2020/,"STEPHEN KENNY TODAY names his squad for Ireland’s latest triple-header: a friendly at Wembley against England along with the closing Uefa Nations League games against Wales and Bulgaria.
What is at stake this month?
On a happier timeline, the England friendly would have been replaced with the Euro 2020 play-off final against Northern Ireland, but this month’s games are not without jeopardy. 
Ireland are currently ranked among the top 20 sides in Europe in Fifa’s World Cup ranking, and so will be second seeds in the World Cup qualifying draw were it held tomorrow. 
The draw will be held on 7 December, however, and so Ireland will have to navigate these three games in order to cling on to their spot as second seeds.
It’s too early to forecast what results Ireland will need to remain as second seeds, but the more games they win, the better. It is technically possible Ireland win all three games and still drop down to third seeds, but that is unlikely.
Beyond that, Kenny could do with some good results for more tangible reasons. Five games into his reign, Ireland have yet to win, or indeed score from open play.
Performances have improved and this has not been ignored in media coverage, but that is a tune that needs to be amplified by a couple of good results. 
Ireland could also do with avoiding relegation to League C of the Nations League, and are currently a point ahead of bottom-placed Bulgaria.
They should have been relegated in 2018 – a rejigging of the format by Uefa handed them an undeserved reprieve – but dropping a division will result in some decidedly unglamorous and hard-to-sell ties with the likes of Estonia, Lithuania and, of course, Georgia. 
Our hopes of sneaking into the World Cup playoffs via the Nations League are gone, given only group winners qualify for that particular back-door.
What shape is his squad in?
The bombshell news came yesterday afternoon, with David McGoldrick announcing his international retirement. McGoldrick said he made the call in the interests of his family and his club career, and was likely informed by the fact he will be 35 by the time the 2022 World Cup swings around. 
Nonetheless, it is a major blow in Kenny’s attempt to qualify for said World Cup, as McGoldrick has arguably been his nation’s best player over the last two years.
Elsehwere, Seamus Coleman and James McCarthy are injury doubts.
Of further concern is the fact many of Kenny’s players have not had much first-team football since the last international match. None of Darren Randolph, Callum Robinson, Robbie Brady, Aaron Connolly, Conor Hourihane, Jayson Molumby, or Shane Long have started a game at club level since the last camp. 
Robinson has played 78 minutes off the bench across three games; Brady has 38 minutes over two games for Burnley; Connolly and Long have featured for 12 and nine minutes respectively; Randolph, Hourihane, and Molumby haven’t played at all. 
Elsewhere, Shane Duffy has been playing regularly at Celtic but has been out of form, and while manager Neil Lennon has condemned media criticism of his defender, he has acknowledged Duffy is struggling for form and has discussed the issue with him.

Duffy was excellent across last month’s international games, so perhaps his poor club form will be less relevant for Kenny.

Will we see any surprise inclusions? 
Given last month’s disruption, there are already very few players who haven’t been given a chance by Kenny. 
Jason Knight might keep his senior sport, though Dara O’Shea is doubtful with injury.
Michael Obafemi, meanwhile, hasn’t played for Southampton’s first team since September so is well out of contention.
Domestically, Jack Byrne hasn’t played since the second day of October so his inclusion looks slim, while it remains to be seen whether any Dundalk players have played their way into contention through their European exploits.
The answer is probably not, though Michael Duffy has been considered by Kenny for earlier squads, and it would be interesting to see the extent to which Chris Shields features in his thoughts should James McCarthy miss out through injury.
Is there likely to be further Covid-19 disruption? 
Hopefully not, given the last three games were utterly undermined by Covid cases. Aaron Connolly and Adam Idah missed the Slovakia play-off as close contacts of an ultimately falsely positive FAI staffer, while Robinson, Alan Browne, John Egan and Callum O’Dowda missed the subsequent game with Wales as close contacts of another positive test.
All were deemed close contacts as a result of where they sat on the plane. 
All aspects of the last camp have been reviewed by Kenny and the FAI, with players canvassed for their experiences at club level. It remains to be seen if anything is done differently this time around, though it’s understood the seating plan was reviewed for the flight to Finland.
What will be in Ireland’s favour this time around is the fact they will be doing less travelling. The players are expected to stay in the UK and assemble in London ahead of the England friendly, and will not necessarily have to fly when travelling to Cardiff for the clash with Wales. 
It means the only pre-game flight they will have to take is back to Dublin for the Aviva clash with Bulgaria.

The Den is coming back and we can all take comfort in the fact that it’ll be just the same as we remember it, with the ultimate goal of messing and winding up Ray D’arcy.
The show will return to our screens this Sunday evening and TheJournal.ie got the inside scoop on what to expect from The Den in 2020 from Zig and Zag. 
The pair spent most of the pandemic their home planet Zog, which Zag said “is like the New Zealand of planets”.
“They’ve kept it [coronavirus] very minimal, everyone wears masks and because we’ve got fur we’re not as prone to the virus so it’s been quite cool,” he explained.
Here’s what else we learned:
Dustin may have stolen their Covid safety equipment from one of his construction jobs
Zag: ”Dustin has promised us that he has all the Covid safety precautions in place in the studio.”
Zig: ”Dustin’s organised all the perspex for us – or “purspex” as he calls it. We’ve got all these sheets of perspex in between where we’re working and everything.”
Zag: ”I think it was a job lot though, I don’t think it’s because of safety, Dustin’s strange that way. He’s always up to something.”
Zig: ”It says Supermacs on all the perspex.”

They’re big fans of Joe Biden
Zag: ”When RTÉ asked us to come down we didn’t know there was going to be a second lockdown and we kind of forgot that Donald Trump would be possibly elected again. The thing is with Donald Trump, he used to like illegal aliens because we interviewed him once, but he’s kind of changed.
“He’s flip-flopped on that now, he definitely flip-flopped but I think he flip flops on everything. He just does whatever he thinks.”
Source: doublezwynne/YouTube
Zag: “We like Mr Biden because he’s from Meath or somewhere isn’t he? Or he’s from Louth…We do like the Irish ones.”
Zig: ”If Biden wins we should have him on The Den. I reckon he would do it, we’ll get him on soon, let’s do that.”
Zig has been working in a supermarket on Planet Zog
Zig was hired to do the “bip” noises in the self service check-out machines.
“He can see the barcode from underneath and as soon as it goes over he just bips,” Zag told us.
Zig has also been collecting cornflakes shaped like Leo Varadkar.
“We’re going to be bringing that collection in so that’s the first half hour of the show taken care of,” he said.
The new live weekly show will be a Covid-free zone
Zag: ”It’s an hour long live TV show from 6.30 to 7.30 every Sunday and the cool thing is it’s almost like a Covid-free zone because we’re not really going to talk about Covid, it’s just going to be talking to people live on the show, doing competitions, ringing up people on the Zoom. It’s just going to be lots of fun really.”
When asked whether they’ll be trying to modernise The Den, Zig says “No”.
“It’ll be just like it was, it’ll be like you just turned it off yesterday and you turned it back on Sunday it’s just going to be the same,” he said.

Zag: ”That’s why we’re doing it live, it’s just like the cameras on, we’ve only got one camera like the old days. So it’s live and in your face and anything can happen and there’s four of us on screen and it’ll be crazy. Ray will be trying to do something and we’ll be going off on a tangent somewhere it’s just going to be loads of fun.”
Zig: ”And the great thing is, we don’t have scripts or anything like that, it’s just like The Den was in the old days. Plug ourselves in and see what happens.”
The lads said they want viewers to send them photographs and videos and to let them know what kind of things they’re doing these days to keep life fun. They’ll also be running competitions and the birthday roller will be making a return so if you have a birthday coming up soon they want to hear from you. 
They’re hoping the show will also be a Ted free zone…
Zag: ”Keep an eye out for Ted, he comes in he attacks Ray, we want to keep this whole show a Ted free zone. Security’s a lot tighter now because of Covid but also because of the threat of Ted.”
Don’t worry, they’re planning to save Christmas
Zig: ”I don’t know if we can tell this secret but there’s a chance that Christmas might need to be saved and we might just be the guys that might have to do it. Because we’ve done it before a few times, we might have to do it again, that’s all I’m saying.”
Zag: ”Yeah because we’re on on the 20th of December, that’s our last show and that’s going to be a kind of Christmas special thing so that’s only five days to go, but we’re going to make sure everything’s in order. And hopefully we might even get Santa Claus the man himself in studio.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said yesterday that the lockdown in England will end on 2 December, despite suggestions it could be extended if it fails to cut infections.
Johnson told parliament the restrictions would “end automatically” on 2 December.
“We will then, I hope very much, be able to get this country going again, to get businesses, to get shops open again in the run up to Christmas,” he told MPs, who had to vote to approve the lockdown yesterday (the result was 516 to 38 in favour).

Last weekend, Johnson announced a lockdown across England after dire warnings that hospitals would be overwhelmed with cases in the coming months if nothing was done.
But his senior colleague Michael Gove indicated the lockdown could last beyond the 2 December cut-off if it failed to bring infection rates down.

The leader of the Labour party, Keir Starmer, also suggested it would be “madness” not to extend the measures if it had not been successful.
He argued for a shorter, circuit-breaker lockdown last month and accused Johnson of ignoring scientific advice to impose the measures sooner.
Johnson had been under pressure from some of his own Conservative MPs not to impose the new restrictions given the effect of the first lockdown on jobs and livelihoods.
The UK is among the hardest-hit countries in the world, with more than 47,000 deaths from just over one million positive Covid-19 cases.

The EU’s chief negotiator said the main stumbling blocks remained the “level playing field” aimed at preventing unfair competition on areas including state subsidies, fisheries policy and the governance of any deal.
Barnier updated MEPs and EU diplomats on the status of the negotiations with his UK counterpart David Frost, which have been taking place in Brussels.
He said: “Despite EU efforts to find solutions, very serious divergences remain in level playing field, governance and fisheries.
“These are essential conditions for any economic partnership.”
Frost said progress had been made during two weeks of intensive talks but “wide divergences remain on some core issues”.
“We continue to work to find solutions that fully respect UK sovereignty,” he said.
Despite the failure to achieve a breakthrough, it is expected that the two sides will remain in contact by videoconference calls, with further talks next week in London.
The EU believes a deal needs to be done by the middle of November if it is to be ratified by the time the UK leaves the single market and customs union when the post-Brexit transition period expires at the end of the year.
In an indication that a deal may not be possible, Barnier said the EU is “prepared for all scenarios”.

SHAMROCK ROVERS WERE presented with the League of Ireland Premier Division trophy after maintaining their unbeaten league record this evening at Tallaght Stadium.
The Hoops, who have been crowned champions for the first time since 2011, played out a scoreless draw with St Patrick’s Athletic, despite playing the last 20 minutes with 10 men following Joey O’Brien’s red card.
Rovers captain Ronan Finn held the trophy aloft following a game that only sparked into action in the final half hour.

With both sides having played twice in the previous seven days, there was a lethargic feel to a first half that passed by with little incident.
Dylan Watts called Brendan Clarke into action early doors with a well-struck effort, while Jordan Gibson flicked a header wide at the other end.
There was a return to action for Jack Byrne, sooner than anticipated, following his well-publicised bout of Covid-19 – he replaced the injured Graham Burke during the first quarter.
The best chance of the half fell to Rovers’ Rhys Marshall. He was played through by a lovely Aaron McEneff pass but, after checking inside Ian Bermingham, he curled his shot wide.

“When the count is finished, we believe we will be the winners,” Biden said in a televised address from his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware as he stressed that “every vote must be counted”, opposing a message from President Donald Trump whose campaign has asked a court to suspend the tabulation of votes in Michigan. 
“After a long night of counting, it’s clear that we’re winning enough states to reach 270 electoral votes to win the presidency,” he said. 
Biden has won the crucial battleground state of Michigan, US networks projected tonight, meaning the former vice president could have flipped another state won by President Donald Trump in 2016.
CNN and NBC News projected the win for Biden in the Midwestern state, which unexpectedly went to Trump by less than half a percentage point in 2016 in one of the stunning state defeats suffered by Hillary Clinton.
AP has yet to call the state for Biden. 
Speaking from the Chase Centre in Wilmington, the Democrat candidate said that despite the pandemic more Americans had voted than ever before. 
“Indeed, Senator Harris and I are on track to win more votes on any ticket in the history of this country… Over 70 million votes,” he said. 
“I’m very proud of our campaign. Only three presidential campaigns in the past have defeated an incumbent President. When it is finished, God willing, we will be the fourth. This is a major achievement,” he said. 
This has been a long and difficult campaign but it has been a more difficult time for our country – a hard time. We have had hard campaigns before and faced hard times before.”
Biden urged voters to put their political differences aside once the election is over.
“So once this election is finalised and behind us, it will be time to do what we have always done as Americans. To put the harsh rhetoric of the campaign behind us and lower the temperature, to see each other again and to listen to one another and hear each other again.
To respect and care for one another. To unite. To heal. To come together as a nation. I am not naïve; neither of us are. I know how deep the opposing views are in our country over so many things.” 
“To make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as enemies. We are not enemies. What brings us together as Americans is stronger than anything that tears us apart.

“So let me be clear – we are campaigning as Democrats but I will govern as an American president.
“The Presidency itself is not a partisan institution.
“It is the one office in this nation that represents everyone and it demands a duty of care for all Americans and that is exactly what I will do. I will work as hard for those who did vote for me as those who did not vote for me. 
“No one is going to take our democracy away from us, not now and not ever. America has come too far and America has fought too many battles and endured too much to ever let that happen.
“We, the people, will not be silenced or bullied and we will not surrender.
“I am confident that we will emerge victorious. This will not be my victory alone or our victory alone but a victory for the American people, for our democracy and for America. There will be no red states or blue states when we win; just the United States of America.”
Concluding his speech, he said: “God bless you all and may God protect our troops.”

The mutation “could pose a risk that future (coronavirus) vaccines won’t work the way they should”, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told a press conference.
“It is necessary to cull all the minks.”
Denmark’s police chief Thorkild Fogde said they would start the culling as “soon as possible”, but conceded that with 15 million to 17 million minks spread over 1,080 farms it was “a very large undertaking”.
The World Health Organization said the novel coronavirus spreads primarily through human-to-human transmission, but that “there is evidence of transmission at the human-animal interface”.
Several animals – including dogs and cats – have tested positive for the virus and there have been reported cases at mink farms in the Netherlands and Spain, as well as in Denmark.
“In a few instances, the minks that were infected by humans have transmitted the virus to other people. These are the first reported cases of animal-to-human transmission,” the WHO said in a statement sent to AFP.
The novel coronavirus has been detected at 207 Danish mink farms, including some cases with a mutated version that has been confirmed to spread back to humans.
Health authorities have also concluded that the mutated virus “is not inhibited by antibodies to the same degree as the normal virus”.
“Studies have shown that the mutations may affect the current candidates for a Covid-19 vaccine,” Health Minister Magnus Heunicke said.
“It is a threat to the development of coronavirus vaccines. That is why it is important that we make a national effort,” he added.
While the majority of cases had been observed in the northern part of the Jutland region, all minks in the country would still be culled.

The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) is developing new technical guidance on animal health, including on testing and quarantine, the WHO said.
In a bid to curb coronavirus, last month Denmark lowered the limit on public gatherings to 10 people from 50 and banned the sale of alcohol after 10 pm while face masks are obligatory in all indoor public spaces.

1171,193,"Italy imposes national curfew and locks down 'red zones'",https://www.thejournal.ie/italy-lockdown-curfew-5255643-Nov2020/,"ITALY PREPARED TO impose a nationwide curfew and new lockdowns in some of its regions to stem a surge in coronavirus cases, following European neighbours in introducing new restrictions.
From Friday, Italy’s 60 million residents will be required to stay home from 10pm until 5am except for work or health reasons under the new decree signed by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.
The government had originally said the new curbs would begin tomorrow, but later delayed them by a day to give businesses affected by the new clampdowns more time to prepare. They are set to run through December 3.
Under the new rules, the country’s regions will be divided into zones — high risk, medium high and moderate — based on how quickly the virus is spreading and availability of hospital beds, among other factors.
“We don’t have alternatives,” Conte said during a televised press conference tonight. 
In the handful of high-risk “red zones”, retail stores not selling essential goods such as food and pharmaceuticals are to shut, people will be prohibited from circulating freely except for work, health and emergency reasons, and from travelling outside their home town or city.
Travel between some regions is to be restricted as well.
Italy was the first European country hit by coronavirus and has so far reported 790,377 cases, including the 30,550 new infections reported in the past 24 hours. Nearly 39,800 people have died from the virus in the country. 
Conte had hoped to avoid a country-wide lockdown such as that imposed in March, which devastated the economy, and wanted to wait to see whether more moderate restrictions imposed last week had had an impact.
These included the closure of pubs and restaurants at 6:00 pm, a move that sparked some small but sometimes violent protests in cities such as Rome, Naples and Turin.
But the quick spread of the virus, which has begun to overwhelm the health system in some areas, is forcing Conte’s hand.
Milan in lockdown
The new restrictions fall short of lockdowns imposed in other European nations such as Britain and France, and were agreed only after long discussion with regional leaders.
On the red-zone list is prosperous, industrial Lombardy in Italy’s north, neighbouring Piedmont, the southern region of Calabria and the Aosta Valley bordered by France and Switzerland.

Only Sicily and Puglia are considered “medium risk” zones, with slightly fewer restrictions than red-zone regions, and the rest of Italy’s 20 regions are “moderate.”
Red-zone restrictions will resemble those imposed earlier this year during a severe national lockdown, but unlike then, churches and parks will be open, hairdressers will operate and restaurants can serve take-out food until the nighttime curfew. 
On a national level, museums will shut and shopping centres will be closed at the weekend. 
Giuseppe Sala, the mayor of Milan in Lombardy, wrote on Facebook that the measures were “severe”, but said they would be “respected and applied.” 
Secondary schools, which were already running most classes online, will switch to total distance learning under the new decree, although younger children will still be allowed to go to school.

However, in the US, where he studied and worked for more than a decade, his significant contributions to space exploration are rarely remembered at all.
(BBC, approximately 14 mins reading time)
Qian was a Chinese citizen, but the Republic of China was an ally of the US, so there was “no massive suspicion about a Chinese scientist at the heart of American space endeavour”, says Fraser Macdonald.
Qian was given security clearance to work on classified weapons research, and even served on the US government’s Science Advisory Board.By the end of the war he was one of the world’s foremost experts on jet propulsion, and was sent with Theodore von Karman on an extraordinary mission to Germany, holding the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel. Their goal was to interview Nazi engineers, including Wernher von Braun, Germany’s leading rocket scientist; America wanted to find out exactly what the Germans knew.
But by the end of the decade Qian’s glittering career in the US came to a sudden halt, and his life there began to unravel. ","It’s a coronavirus-free zone as we bring you an interesting longread each evening to take your mind off today’s news events.",3,0,0,15045,"Nov 4th 2020, 8:30 PM"

From tomorrow, pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops will again be forced to close their doors after the Commons voted by 516 to 38 – a Government majority of 478 – for the new restrictions.
However, in a bigger than expected rebellion, 32 Tory MPs defied the whips to vote against the measures, with two more acting as tellers for the noes.
The move came as the NHS in England was set to move into its highest alert level – level 4 – from midnight amid a continuing rise in coronavirus patients needing hospital care.
NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said the service already had “22 hospitals’ worth” of Covid-19 patients and now faced a “serious situation ahead”.
Professor Stephen Powis, NHS England’s national medical director, said the number of people in hospital was rising across the country, including in the south of England.
 With Labour supporting the new lockdown restrictions – which were also expected to be approved by the House of Lords later on Wednesday – the Government’s majority was never in doubt.
However Mr Johnson faced an angry backlash from some Tory MPs – led by former prime minister Theresa May – alarmed at the economic impact of the controls as well as the curtailment of civil liberties.
In the Commons, the Prime Minister sought to reassure MPs that the measures – which are due to expire on December 2 – should enable shops and businesses to reopen in time for the run-up to Christmas.
He acknowledged however that it would depend on getting the R number – the reproduction rate of the virus – back down below 1.
Opening the debate, Johnson said that without action now, the chances of the NHS being in “extraordinary trouble” by December were “very, very high”.
“Let me be clear that this existential threat to our NHS comes not from focusing too much on coronavirus, as is sometimes asserted, but from not focusing enough,” he said.
“We simply cannot reach the point where our National Health Service is no longer there for everyone.”
Labour leader Keir Starmer said that while the restrictions were not “desirable or perfect”, they were necessary as the Government had “lost control of the virus”.
However, Johnson faced a barrage of criticism from some Tories who questioned the statistics used to justify the lockdown, including one forecast suggesting there could be 4,000 deaths a day.

May said pointedly that Parliament would make better decisions if it was “fully and properly informed” about the facts.
“For many people it looks as if the figures are chosen to support the policy rather than the policy being based on the figures,” she said.
Graham Brady, influential chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 Committee, questioned whether the Government had any right to take some of the measures it wanted.
“The thing that troubles me most is that the Government is reaching too far in to the private and family lives of our constituents. I think there is an, unintended perhaps, arrogance in assuming the Government has the right to do so,” he said.
Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith complained the Government had been “bounced” into the lockdown after details were leaked over the weekend.
“Whoever did it should be sacked, strung up to dry, come here to apologise, grovelled out the door on hands and knees and beaten on the way out frankly.

MANCHESTER UNITED PRODUCED a shambolic first-half defensive display as they slipped to a 2-1 Champions League defeat against Istanbul Basaksehir this evening.
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side, struggling badly in the Premier League, failed to reproduce the zest and intensity they showed in impressive wins against Paris Saint-Germain and RB Leipzig last month.
The three-time European champions dominated possession in Turkey but were badly exposed on the break as former Chelsea forward Demba Ba and Edin Visca put the home side 2-0 ahead.
United gave themselves hope when they reduced the deficit shortly before half-time through an Anthony Martial header. But despite multiple second-half changes, Solskjaer’s men could not find a way past the determined Basaksehir defence.
United started on the front foot in the early minutes of the game, with no sign of the defensive chaos to come in front of a small but vocal crowd. Luke Shaw fizzed a ball past the far post with his left foot but United, with Marcus Rashford and Martial up front, lacked a decisive final touch.
The home side were ahead in the 12th minute after a long clearance found the unmarshalled Ba, who collected the ball just inside his own half and raced through to beat goalkeeper Dean Henderson, making his European debut in place of David de Gea.
Axel Tuanzebe, who impressed in Paris, had a heart-stopping moment after he pulled Ba back but escaped with a yellow card.
Basaksehir remained threatening on the break, with United worryingly open at the back, and they were caught napping again five minutes before half time. Deniz Turuc robbed Juan Mata of possession down the left and raced forward, sending over a cross that Ba stepped over and Visca smashed home.

United crucially reduced the deficit in the 43rd minute when Martial steered a Shaw cross home with his head.
Solskjaer hooked Tuanzebe off at the interval, with Scott McTominay coming on and Nemanja Matic dropping back to play at centre-back alongside Harry Maguire.
Bruno Fernandes had a free-kick from a central position about 10 minutes after the restart but his shot did not have the power to beat Basaksehir goalkeeper Mert Gunok.
Solskjaer threw on Edinson Cavani and Paul Pogba in place of Mata and Donny van de Beek to add impetus to the attack but United struggled to create clear chances. Mason Greenwood came on for Rashford as United continued to search for a way through.
They went agonisingly close to an equaliser in stoppage time when a header was cleared off the line but they could not rescue a point.

Republicans are defending their 53-47 majority in the Senate, and Gideon’s loss makes it that much more difficult for Democrats to win back the upper chamber of Congress.
Controlling the Senate is vital as the party in power determines which bills reach the floor and which of the president’s nominees receive confirmation votes.
Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s party would need to gain four seats to seize the chamber – or three seats if Biden wins the White House, as a US vice president breaks a draw in the Senate in the event of a 50-50 vote.
At the time of writing, the Washington Post called the vote a 46-47, with a flip by the Democrats in Colorado later cancelled out by the Republicans in Alabama.
If Democrats can win two seats, control of the chamber could hang in the balance until a runoff in Georgia’s other special election Senate race is held on 5 January
Democrats drew first blood when Colorado’s former governor John Hickenlooper, a 68-year-old businessman and geologist, handily defeated one-term Senator Cory Gardner to pick up a seat.
However, Republicans got a defensive boost when retired American football coach Tommy Tuberville handily defeated Senator Doug Jones in a race that was widely expected to result in a Republican pick-up.

Senator Lindsey Graham – who was under intense pressure after overseeing the controversial confirmation process of a Supreme Court justice weeks before the presidential vote – fought back a fierce challenge from African-American Jaime Harrison in the conservative bastion of South Carolina.
“We didn’t get the result at the ballot box that we wanted, but we showed courage and determination,” Harrison, who raised record amounts of campaign funding, said.
Republicans initially fared well elsewhere too, including Kentucky – where Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell easily prevailed – and the states of Texas and Montana.
‘Save the Senate’
And Iowa Senator Joni Ernst, a close Trump ally whom Democrats were intensely targeting, also defeated her challenger, several US networks projected.
Another hotly contested seat was tilting the Republicans’ way in North Carolina, where networks have yet to call the race but where Senator Thom Tillis claimed a crucial win, with some 94 percent of the vote counted.
“What we accomplished tonight was a stunning victory – and we did it against all the odds, right?” Tillis told boisterous supporters, adding that he was doing his part “to save the Senate”.

The Democrats would need to gain four seats to seize the chamber – or three seats if Biden wins the race to the White House, as a vice president breaks a tie in the Senate in the event of a 50-50 vote.
But Maine’s embattled Republican Senator Susan Collins was seven percentage points ahead with two-thirds of precincts reporting, and in Georgia incumbent David Perdue was leading Democrat Jon Ossoff with 90 percent of precincts reporting.
Democrats also kept the House of Representatives, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi – Trump’s chief nemesis in Washington – likely to preside over proceedings for two more years, but it remained unclear whether Democrats could increase their majority.
Popular New York progressive Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez comfortably secured a second term, as did the three other members of “The Squad” a liberal quartet that has occasionally faced intense criticism from Trump and his allies.
“I’m very, very proud of the fact that tonight – relatively early – we are able to say we have held the House,” Pelosi said.

HEALTH MINISTER STEPHEN DONNELLY has said the reproductive number has dropped again to between 0.7 and 0.9.
The R number is the rate at which the disease spreads from an infected person to other people – so if the R-number is at 1, an infected person will spread it to an average of one other person. 
Last week, the R number was 1. 
When announcing that the country was moving to Level 5 on 19 October, the Taoiseach said at the end of the six-week period, the Government wants the country to go to Level 3 and bring the R number to below 1.
Speaking in the Oireachtas Health Committee, the minister said there has been a 40% fall in demand for testing in the past week.
He told the committee this morning that the decision to move to Level 5 two week ago was made due to evidence showing the rapid increase in case numbers and the need to get the virus down to much lower levels.
Donnelly said there have been positive signs in recent days, stating that  Ireland’s 14-day incidence rate is 228 cases per 100,000. This compares with 278 in the previous 14-day period.
He said the rate is falling in 23 of the 26 counties. Donnelly said the average number of close contacts has fallen from 6 around 3, with the testing positivity rate falling to 4.7%.

The committee was also told the country’s testing capacity is now 140,000. 
“By moving early and comprehensively, Ireland is currently bucking the trend being seen in many other parts of Europe. The 14-day rate in France for example is 830. In Spain it is 567. With our neighbours, the UK, it is 469.
“While our figures are hopeful, the number of positive cases remain a serious concern. We have seen almost 11,000 cases reported in the past 14 days. We must continue to actively suppress this virus to the greatest extent possible,” he said.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin told a meeting of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party this evening that there will be no early lifting of lockdown restrictions and that Level 5 would be in place for the full six weeks.
It is understood government wants the six week period to be used to prepare for the next phase, which will kick in in December.
The Taoiseach has indicated the country will move to Level 3 once the severe lockdown measures expire.  ","The minister said there has been a 40% fall in demand for testing in the past week.",2,0,0,35933,"Nov 4th 2020, 12:02 PM"

Last night, Varadkar apologised in the Dáil for “errors of judgement” after he gave a copy of an agreement negotiated between the Government and the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) to a rival GP group last year.
The Tánaiste was grilled about what motivated him to send the document to Dr Maitiú Ó Tuathail of the NAGP – someone Varadkar said is a friend but “not a close friend”.
He was also questioned about that friendship and the timeline of their contacts – whether he had been in touch with Ó Tuathail since the story broke in the Village magazine on Saturday, and if he had ever leaked a confidential report before. 
At the Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting, he said it was the first time in almost ten years he has ever had to do something like that in chamber, but said it was important for accountability.
In what is described as an off the cuff remark, Varadkar warned party members to be careful who you think your friends are, saying politics is getting nastier.
“It was a mess of my making and I shouldn’t have dragged you guys into it. Hopefully it’s behind us now,” he said.
Separately, Varadkar spoke about the US election, saying that Joe Biden will be positive for Ireland as someone who has a genuine personal attachment to country beyond “just a golf resort”.
He said Biden has shown an interest in Brexit and its impact on Ireland, particularly what it means for the Good Friday Agreement.
The Taoiseach said he had confidence in the Tánaiste earlier this week. Tonight, Micheál Martin faced criticism from party backbenchers about how he defended the Tánaiste during the controversy over a leaked document.

A number of Fianna Fáil TDs have taken issue with the manner in which senior figures in the party came to the defence of the Tánaiste.
Ahead of tonight’s Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting, Sligo TD Marc MacSharry has said he is very unhappy with the way Martin and other Fianna Fáil ministers came out to bat for Varadkar.
He said he is “appalled” that there was little debate internally within the party about the approach, and highlighted that there are different standards depending on who the protagonists involved are, stating that government cannot preside over one rule for some, and no rules for others, pointing to contrasts in the handling of the controversies involving Fianna Fáil ministers Barry Cowen and Dara Calleary. 
In a scathing attack, MacSharry told the Taoiseach this evening that in defending Varadkar, Martin has dragged them all down by supporting him.
He said he was disgusted at how Micheál Martin was ruining the party, and blamed him for the party’s poor performance in the polls.
MacSharry said he was “beyond disgust and depression at issues of the last number of days”, telling the Taoiseach that there was “palpable anger throughout the country” from party members to see Martin out “as chief flag flyer for Leo”.
While Martin said earlier in the day that he is not responsible for what Varadkar did in the last Government, MacSharry said he appears to have no issue taking responsibility for road traffic offences dating back to 2016 and “throwing Barry Cowen and Dara Calleary under the bus”.

Fianna Fáil TD says there are inconsistencies in Varadkar's statement, but adds he shouldn't resign
MacSharry rounded on the Taoiseach’s performance in Leaders’ Questions today, stating that when Martin “ran out of road” on defending Varadkar against Mary Lou McDonald he resorted to his “usual obsession of talking about ‘The Troubles’”. 
He said this obsession handed Sinn Féin hundreds of thousands of votes that they were never getting. MacSharry said whether anyone likes it or not, discussions around the Troubles are “nowadays for most people under 50 or the subject matter of interesting historical documentaries”. He said whether Fianna Fáil likes it or not many see Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams in the same light as Éamon de Valera and Michael Collins. 
MacSharry accused Martin of dragging the party down to 11% in the polls, stating “you need to accept you are part of the problem. Not the solution. At the moment you are the problem. I am disgusted with your conduct”.
Martin is understood to have retorted that MacSharry’s tone of criticism was very personal, in which the Sligo TD responded by stating that it was “not personal, but fact” and if he couldn’t take the criticism, he shouldn’t be leading the party.
Fianna Fáil’s Barry Cowen told the Taoiseach this evening that Varadkar took the wrong route, but said the Tánaiste made no gain from the sharing of the agreement. He said it wasn’t a resigning issue.
Cowen told the Taoiseach that he “did not get due process” and was sacked.
It has emerged this evening, that the Rural Independents Group has formally requested the Dáil Committee on Procedure to investigate if the Tánaiste broke any codes of conduct for TDs or office holders.
A letter to the Ceann Comhairle signed by Tipperary TD Mattie McGrath states that the group is seeking for the Committee on Procedure to review this matter entirely and undertake an investigation. 
“We believe that the actions of the Tánaiste, Leo Varadkar TD, when he was Taoiseach, may have breached both the ‘Code of Conduct for Members of Dáil Éireann’ and the ‘Code of Conduct for Office Holders. We think that the exposure of the Tánaiste’s actions has shattered public confidence and trust, therefore greatly impacting on Government’s integrity,” states the letter.
“This debacle must be fully investigated,” writes McGrath.

During Leaders’ Questions today, Social Democrats co-leader Roisin Shortall called on the Taoiseach to undertake an immediate review of the code of conduct for office holders.
In response the Taoiseach said there was an obligation on all members to adhere to the code of conduct.
She said Varadkar had “ludicrously” dressed the issue up as having a legitimate objective and “laughingly” claimed that he was honouring Government commitments.
“This insults people’s intelligence,” she said.
“I think most people saw this episode for what it was. It was patently untrue for the Tanaiste to claim that. He engaged in a deliberate distortion of the truth,” she siad. 
Shortall said the Tanaiste engaged in “grubby activity for grubby purposes” by leaking a Government document.","The Tánaiste said tonight the controversy was ‘a mess of my making’.",20,0,0,47053,"Nov 4th 2020, 6:33 PM"

“There have been reports of irregularities in several Wisconsin counties which raise serious doubts about the validity of the results,” campaign manager Bill Stepien said in a statement.
Stepian did not provide any details about the reports he was referring to and there appears to be no evidence for the claims.
“The President is well within the threshold to request a recount and we will immediately do so,” he added.
The statement came in the immediate aftermath of the crucial swing state’s Elections Commission Administrator revealing that all ballots had been counted. Officials in Wisconsin are expected to officially declare a winner in the coming hours. 
Trump’s campaign also said that it had filed a lawsuit to stop the counting of votes in Michigan until “meaningful access” was granted. It also demanded to review ballots that were opened and counted when it did not have meaningful access.
There is no clear winner in the crucial state, which has 16 electoral college votes. A total of 270 electoral votes are required to be declared the winner of the election. 
An estimated 3.3 million people voted in Wisconsin, which has 10 electoral votes. With more than 97% of the ballots tallied, several US news outlets were reporting that Biden was leading by around 20,000 votes, representing a margin of about 0.7%. CNN and AP both projected that Biden has won the state. 
If Biden does eke out a victory in the Midwest state it will make Trump’s path to retaining the White House significantly more difficult. 
Shortly after Stepian’s comments, Biden published a tweet suggesting that his campaign could request recounts of their own. He said they were seeking donations so that Democrats could establish “the largest election protection effort ever assembled”.

Trump’s campaign also asked to intervene in a pending US Supreme Court case over whether Pennsylvania should be permitted to accept late-arriving ballots sent by Election Day.
The Trump campaign accused electoral officials of prohibiting its “observers” from approaching closer to 25 feet (7.6 metres) to vote counters in Pennsylvania.
“We are also suing to temporarily halt counting until there is meaningful transparency and Republicans can ensure all counting is done above board and by the law,” deputy campaign manager Justin Clark said in a statement.
The US Presidential election in 2016 also resulted in a recount in Wisconsin after Green Party candidate Jill Stein challenged the results. The 10-day recount did little to change the final tally of votes, seeing Trump’s margin of victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton drop by 131 votes to 22,748.

The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) has welcomed rulings published today confirming that age restrictions enforced to stop those aged 35 and over from joining the Garda Síochána as trainees are discriminatory.
The Commission provided legal representation to both men at the centre of today’s cases to challenge this discrimination which.
Brian Fitzpatrick and Ronald Boyle had sought to join an Garda Síochána between 2005 and 2007, but were refused entry based on Garda regulations, which set the upper age limit for entry as a trainee at under 35.
Following their rejection, the men brought complaints before the Equality Tribunal on the basis that the maximum age limit for entry to the Garda Síochána amounted to age discrimination under the Employment Equality Act 1998, which is the national legislation that gives effect to the EU Framework Directive on equal treatment in employment.
The cases centred on whether the Garda Commissioner could show that the application of an upper age limit in the regulations was justified as a genuine occupational requirement or on the basis of fulfilling a legitimate employment policy under the relevant EU and national law provisions.
The WRC adjudicators found that the age limit applied to the two men’s Garda applications, was not proportionate and was discriminatory.
The adjudicator found that the Garda Commissioner had not shown that there would be a significant number of members of Gardaí unable to perform physically demanding tasks if this upper age limit did not apply.
The Garda Commissioner had also not shown that the maximum recruitment age could be justified on the basis of training requirements or the need for a reasonable period of employment before retirement.
Distress
The maximum compensation possible under the equality legislation in force at the time was awarded to each man of €12,700 for “the distress suffered as a result of this discrimination.”

 The Commission has called on Justice Minister Helen McEntee to review this age limit to bring it into step with other police forces internationally, including in the UK, and in line with the findings of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland which stated that “age diversity should be encouraged. The current maximum age limit of 35 is outdated and should be scrapped.”

Chief Commissioner of the IHREC Sinéad Gibney said:
“Discrimination holds real and significant impacts for people. These two men were arbitrarily denied any prospect of providing service to the State as members of the Garda Síochána due to their age, and their career aspirations subsequently dashed. “I pay credit to the determination of Brian and Ronald in persevering with their cases despite such a long delay to secure today’s decisions. We hope that their work to secure justice will pave the way in ensuring that others do not suffer this kind of age discrimination when seeking to join the Garda Síochána.”
Responding to the ruling in his case Ronald Boyle told The Journal the discrimination he faced was “based not on my ability, but solely and exclusively on my age.”
“I call on Justice Minister Helen McEntee to bring an end to this ongoing prejudice in the same way previous discriminatory regulations, such as height and eyesight requirements have been abolished and bring An Garda Síochána into line with neighbouring police forces where my fellow Irish citizens do not suffer such discrimination.”
A spokeswoman for An Garda Síochána said it will review today’s ruling and will discuss it with the Department of Justice. 
“In line with recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing an expert group, which is independently chaired, has been established to review learning and development in An Garda Síochána. A sub-group of this group will be looking at entry paths into An Garda Síochána including entry requirements,” said the spokeswoman.

Ben Blackwell from Ratoath in Co Meath won damages from the vaccine maker and the health service after he received the Pandemrix vaccine at school in February 2010 during the swine flu pandemic.
RTÉ report that the boy was later diagnosed with the sleep disorder narcolepsy and the auto-immune disease cataplexy, and suffers from exhaustion during the day, as well as sleep paralysis and hallucinations.
It’s also reported that the terms of the settlement have not been finalised, and are set to come before the High Court at a later date.
In a statement, Sound – a group for those affected by the vaccine – called on the State to offer similar settlements to all families affected by narcolepsy due to Pandemrix.
“We thank Ben Blackwell and his family for taking this case,” the group’s secretary Tadgh Kennedy said in a statement.
“We are very conscious that all families, regardless of their legal representation, should now be offered this settlement.”
Kennedy said that the State’s response to those affected by the vaccine’s side effects had been “painfully slow”, leading to a difficult and protracted process for the families involved.
“Sound is not anti-vaccination and High Court proceedings have never been our primary focus,” he added.
To date, more than 80 cases have been lodged before the courts in relation to Pandemrix.

US PRESIDENT DONALD Trump has given a statement on the shooting at the Capital Gazette saying that journalists “shouldn’t fear being violently attacked while doing their job”.
Five people were shot dead after a shooter opened fire at the offices of the Capital Gazette newspaper building in Annapolis, Maryland in the US last night.
The suspect, 38-year-old Jarrod Warren Ramos, had an acrimonious history with the newspaper, including a lawsuit and years of harassment of its journalists on Twitter.
At a press conference today, Trump said:
Before going any further today, I want to address the horrific shooting that took place yesterday at the Capital Gazette newsroom in Annapolis, Maryland. This attack shocked the conscience of our nation, and filled our hearts with grief.
Journalists, like all Americans, should be free from the fear of being violently attacked while doing their job.

The orders were sought by KBC Bank in respect of properties at Richmond Avenue, Fairview, Dublin 3, and Little Mary Street, Dublin 1.
KBC claimed Beades borrowed approximately €1.3 million in 2003 from IIB Homeloans Ltd which were secured on the properties.
KBC claims some €2.1 million remains outstanding on the loans. KBC sought orders including one for the execution of the possession order in respect of the properties.
The lender secured possession orders in respect of the properties from the High Court in 2008. Those orders were appealed to the Supreme Court, which affirmed the High Court’s decision in 2014.
Beades opposed the orders on the grounds including the orders were granted in favour of IIB Homeloans, who advanced loans to the businessman, and could not be executed by its successor in title KBC Bank PLC.
Beades had also disputed the application on grounds including that IIB was not entitled to sell the loans without his consent to KBC, that there had been a misuse of his personal data by IIB in providing information concerning the loans to KBC.
He also argued there had been a delay, with no explanation, in executing the possession orders to the effect KBC had forfeited its right to execute the order.
Giving the Court’s judgement Justice Caroline Costello said she had no hesitation in ruling in favour of KBC and granted it permission to issue an order allowing it execute the possession orders in respect of the two properties.
The Judge rejected all grounds of the businessman’s claims including that the possession order was not assignable from IIB to KBC.
In 2008 IIB Homeloans Ltd changed its name to KBC Mortgage Bank.
In 2009 under the 1971 Central Bank Act the Minister for Finance approved a scheme of transfer between KBC Mortgage Bank and KBC Bank Ireland Plc.

The Judge said Beades’s argument cannot succeed in light of the wording of 2009 order when combined with the 1971 Act.
As of the date of transfer, KBC was substituted as the plaintiff in the proceedings by operation of law and became entitled to any benefits or payments due to the KBC Mortgage Bank formerly IIB.
KBC Bank had been assigned the order for possession, the Judge said.
The Judge also said consent from Beades was not required to sell the loans, and IIB had been authorised by the businessman to disclose the information he claimed was wrongfully disclosed to KBC.
In regards to the delay argument, the Judge said Beades had come before the Court in circumstances where no payment in respect of the loan for more than 10 years.
While no information was before the court about the value of the rent roll in respect of the properties there was no dispute that no rent had gone to KBC in part discharge of very considerable sums outstanding in the loan, the Judge said.","The financial lender claims that more than €2 million in loans to the anti-eviction activist remains outstanding.",24,0,4,20682,"Jun 29th 2018, 7:44 PM"

Sabrina O’Connor (37) of The Green, Dunboyne Castle, Dunboyne, Co Meath, had denied 13 counts of theft and one of deception in Dublin on dates between June 2010 and December 2011.
After just under six hours of deliberating, a jury at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court returned a verdict of not guilty on ten charges. The jury were unable to reach verdicts on three counts and she was remanded on continuing bail to 9 July next to deal with these charges.
Judge Karen O’Connor told the accused, who began crying after the verdict was read out, that she had not behaved in an admirable fashion with respect to the company procedures in place for care workers and clients.
During the trial, the accused agreed that she knew it was against her work policy and procedures to accept money from a client.
“It was wrong for me to accept it. I was under pressure. I didn’t make the right decision,” O’Connor said.
Allegations
The State had alleged that O’Connor had access to certain of the woman’s documents and information, and stole from the woman’s bank account while she worked as her carer.
The largest single sum allegedly stolen was €15,000, which the State claimed O’Connor used to secure an option to purchase or rent a house.
O’Connor had previously told the jury that she had tried to pay this €15,000 back to the complainant but was told the cash was “in custody”. Today, Judge O’Connor ordered that this sum be paid over to the complainant.
It was further alleged that O’Connor stole a bank draft for €8,500 from the woman to buy a Land Rover vehicle.
The court also heard evidence that O’Connor used 11 cheques to take money from the woman’s account and then spent the money for her own benefit. The cheques were for amounts ranging between €1,000 and €2,500 and came to a total of €20,100.
Elderly woman
The elderly woman took the stand and said that after she suffered a stroke, she had other people take money out of her bank account for her. She said O’Connor, who was then her carer, mostly had access to this account.
She said O’Connor bought food for her using bank cards attached to the account, and would also pay bills for her using cheques.
In her evidence, O’Connor testified that the woman had gifted her cash to buy a vehicle and had also lent her money towards a deposit on a house. O’Connor said that the woman “wanted to help her out with transport” when she learned that O’Connor no longer had transport available to her.
O’Connor said the woman had insisted and had suggested she would give her €10,000 for a car.
“She told me to get something and pick it out and she would pay for it,” said O’Connor.
“My understanding was that it was a gift. I told her I would pay it back,” O’Connor said but confirmed that she has not paid the woman back.
She said the woman had also loaned her €15,000 to put down as a deposit on a house because “she wanted to help me out with my family”.
O’Connor said the deal was that she would give the money back to the woman in two years, although she agreed that the money had not been repaid.
O’Connor told her counsel that there were also times when the woman told her she needed money and O’Connor would withdraw cash from her own account for her. The woman would then write her a cheque for the money and the accused would lodge it in her own account.
She agreed that this was “very unusual”. She told counsel for the State that she didn’t tell her employers that she had done this because she was afraid of losing her job. O’Connor told the jury the woman was “very different to any other client”.
“She was very much in control of everything. She was very strong-minded. She made all her own decisions. She spent a lot money. She gave a lot of money anyway,” O’Connor said.

Additional evidence
The complainant said she kept her chequebook in an unlocked drawer in her house. She said she would put her initials only on the cheque as she wasn’t able to write out other details.
When shown a bank draft and withdrawal slip for €15,000 from her account, the woman confirmed her initials on both documents but said she had no recollection of withdrawing that amount or of giving O’Connor permission to do so.
She said she did not tell O’Connor she could have the amount to purchase an option to buy or rent a house in Malahide.
The woman also agreed that her initials were on a bank draft setting out a withdrawal of €8,500, but said she did not tell O’Connor that she could use this amount to buy a motor vehicle.
The woman told counsel she had agreed to lend O’Connor the money after the accused asked her for the sum to have an operation on her leg. The complainant said she didn’t know if O’Connor had had the operation and that “no way” had she been paid back by the accused.
Similarly, the woman confirmed that her initials were on the 11 cheques allegedly stolen from her account, but said she had “no recollection” of writing those cheques or giving O’Connor permission to do so.
The court heard that the woman told gardaí she was “very annoyed” that her money was gone.
She also denied that a female friend had in any way assisted her memory when she was making her statement to gardaí regarding the alleged thefts.

1188,284,"Maryland newsroom shooter barricaded exit so people couldn't escape",https://www.thejournal.ie/capital-gazette-shooting-suspect-4099130-Jun2018/,"Updated Jun 29th 2018, 5:15 PM
A PROSECUTOR SAYS the shooter who opened fire at the office of Maryland newspaper yesterday barricaded the exit door so employees couldn’t escape.
Wes Adams said this afternoon that there were two entrances to the office. He says the suspect, Jarrod Warren Ramos, entered through the front door and “worked his way through the office.”
Adams also says one victim who attempted to escape through the back door was shot.
A judge ordered Ramos to remain detained during a court hearing this afternoon. Judge Thomas Pryal said he found a likelihood that the 38-year-old Ramos is a danger.
Ramos appeared in an Annapolis courtroom via video feed. He appeared to watch attentively during the hearing but never spoke. He was dressed in blue detention clothing.
He is charged with five counts of first-degree murder in the killings inside the office of the Capital Gazette newspaper yesterday.
Police say he had a long, acrimonious history with the newspaper, including a lawsuit and years of harassment of its journalists on Twitter.
Tom Marquardt, retired publisher and top editor at the paper, told The Capital Gazette yesterday that he had long been concerned about Ramos’ history of escalating social media attacks against the newspaper and its journalists.
He called police about Ramos in 2013 and considered filing a restraining order against him.
“I was seriously concerned he would threaten us with physical violence,” Marquardt said.
“I even told my wife, ‘We have to be concerned. This guy could really hurt us’.”
Lawsuit
Ramos filed a failed lawsuit against the paper in 2012, alleging the newspaper, a columnist and an editor defamed him in an article about his conviction in a criminal harassment case in 2011.
According to court documents, five days after Ramos pleaded guilty to criminal harassment, the newspaper published a story describing allegations by a woman who claimed Ramos harassed her online for months.
The article said Ramos had contacted the woman on Facebook and thanked her “for being the only person ever to say, ‘Hello’, or be nice to him in school”.
The woman told the newspaper that Ramos appeared to be having some problems, so she wrote back and tried to help, suggesting a counselling centre.
She said that set off months of emails in which Ramos sometimes asked for help, but other times called her vulgar names and told her to kill herself.
She told The Capital that she told him to stop, but the emails continued. She said she called police and the emails stopped for months, but then started up again “nastier than ever”, the article said.

In his lawsuit, Ramos said the article contained false and defamatory statements and injured his reputation.
A judge dismissed the suit after asking Ramos to point out a single statement in the article that was false or to give a single example of how it had harmed him.
“He could not do so,” an appeals court wrote in upholding the dismissal.

Suspect description
In the article, Ramos was described as a tall, thin man with long hair worn in a ponytail.
His lawyer told the newspaper that Ramos has a degree in computer engineering and had worked for the US Bureau of Labor Statistics for six years. His lawyer also said Ramos had no previous criminal record.
Ramos took to Twitter, where he routinely harassed journalists from the newspaper in scores of profanity-laced tweets. One of those tweets targeted one of the journalists killed yesterday, Rob Hiaasen. In another tweet, he discussed how he’d enjoy seeing the paper stop publishing, but “it would be nicer” to see two journalists “cease breathing”.

Online court records in Maryland show that three peace orders were taken out against Ramos – one each in 2011, 2012 and 2013. A judge can issue such protection, ordering someone to stay away from someone else and to avoid contacting them. In at least two instances, Ramos appealed the orders. It wasn’t clear whom the cases involved or what the ultimate outcomes were.
Then, in 2013, Ramos sued Anne Arundel County District Judge John McKenna. Online court records did not indicate the nature or result of that suit.
Ramos filed another lawsuit in 2014 against three defendants. A judge in Prince George’s dismissed that case two years later when Ramos failed to show up for court.

1192,179,"Irish Water has imposed a hosepipe ban in Greater Dublin Area from Monday",https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-water-hosepipe-ban-2-4099886-Jun2018/,"IRISH WATER HAS said a hosepipe ban will be put in place from Monday 2 July in the Greater Dublin Area.
As demand continues to outstrip supply and the warm weather looks set to continue, Irish Water said it has taken the extra step to use the legal options open to it.
Section 56 (16) of the Water Services Act 2007 allows for an effective ‘hosepipe ban’.
The Water Conservation Order will be in place until 31 July but Irish Water said it will keep the situation under review and may have to extend the period of time the order is in place.
The prohibited use will apply to the use of water drawn through a hosepipe or similar for the purpose of:
watering a garden
cleaning a private motor-vehicle using a domestic hosepipe
cleaning a private leisure boat using a hosepipe
filling or maintaining a domestic swimming or paddling pool (except when using hand-held containers filled directly from a tap)
filling or maintaining a domestic pond (excluding fish ponds) using a hosepipe
filling or maintaining an ornamental fountain (with the exception of such use for commercial purposes)
use of water for filling or replenishing an artificial pond (excluding fish ponds), lake or similar application.
This order applies to the Greater Dublin Water Supply Area.
Irish Water said it will examine the over 100 at risk schemes around the country for possible application of a Water Conservation Order.
Speaking about the legal move, Irish Water’s corporate affairs manager Kate Gannon said: “Imposing a Water Conservation Order is a measure that Irish Water now consider appropriate. It is essential that our water supply resource are conserved if we are to avoid restrictions and outages over the coming weeks and months.
The legislation actually requires us to demonstrate that there is an urgent need for the Water Conservation Order and that it can only be applied where and when it is necessary. Therefore we are considering such orders on a scheme by scheme basis.
Irish Water said it is “mindful of the impact that a Water Conservation Order might have on businesses and the tourist industry and for that reason the prohibition is mainly limited to domestic users with the exception of gardens”.
“We are really grateful for the measures that people have taken to conserve water so far and we hope that placing a Water Conservation Order will make people more mindful of their responsibilities and the impact their water usage is having on their neighbours and communities,” Gannon said.
Gannon added that the utility has been in touch with large commercial users in the last two days who have committed to conserve water.
“We are very grateful to them for their efforts,” she said.
“Businesses will also be subject to the hosepipe ban for the purpose of watering gardens but we are also appealing to them to limit all non-essential water use to avoid using hosepipes or power washers where possible, particularly if it is for cosmetic reasons.”","Section 56 (16) of the Water Services Act 2007 allows for an effective ‘hosepipe ban’.",1099,0,3,72014,"Jun 29th 2018, 4:31 PM"
1193,246,"Two men found in burning car died of gunshot wounds to their heads, court hears",https://www.thejournal.ie/men-burning-car-gunshot-court-4099646-Jun2018/,"TWO DUBLINERS, WHOSE bodies were found in a burning car six years ago, died of gunshot wounds to their heads, the Central Criminal Court has heard.
The evidence was given to the court yesterday in the trial of a 35-year-old Dubliner charged with murdering the two men, who the prosecutor described as ‘small-time criminals’.
Jason O’Driscoll, with an address at Richmond Avenue, Fairview is accused of murdering fellow Dubliners 31-year-old Anthony Burnett and 25-year-old Joseph Redmond on 7 March 2012 in Co Louth.
He has pleaded not guilty to both charges and the jury will be asked to use circumstantial evidence to convict him.
Alexander Owens SC, prosecuting, yesterday read out the report of the pathologist, who carried out the post-mortem exams on both bodies.
Dr Khalid Jaber, who was Deputy State Pathologist at the time, said that he viewed the charred remains of both men at the scene before carrying out the autopsies.
He said that several bones had broken due to the heat of the fire and that some of their features were no longer identifiable.
He retrieved fragments of projectiles from their heads, which a garda already testified had constituted two bullets to each head.
Dr Jaber gave the cause of their deaths as gunshot wounds to their heads, with cyanide poisoning a secondary cause in Redmond’s case. Cyanide in his blood would have resulted from the burning of the vehicle, he explained.
The trial will continue on Monday before Justice Michael White and a jury of five women and seven men.

1194,286,"Evidence of four witnesses should be disregarded, Disclosures Tribunal told",https://www.thejournal.ie/disclosures-tribunal-10-4099642-Jun2018/,"THE CHARLETON TRIBUNAL should disregard the evidence of four witnesses, including two TDs, in favour of the testimony of former commissioner Martin Callinan, a barrister for An Garda Síochána has said.
Mr Justice Peter Charleton made his closing remarks at the tribunal today.
Shane Murphy SC said that the evidence of the four men – journalist Philip Boucher-Hayes, TDs, John McGuinness and John Deasy and comptroller and auditor general Seamus McCarthy – could not be regarded as corroborating each other, as they were each alleging different things were said during conversations with Callinan about whistleblower Sergeant Maurice McCabe.
The tribunal, which is examining allegations from former garda press officer Superintendent David Taylor that he was directed to brief negatively against Sergeant McCabe, is hearing closing submissions before the chairman, Mr Justice Peter Charleton retires to write his report.
Witnesses
Murphy said that a common element was that none of the witnesses had come forward at the time to report what they alleged Callinan had said to them.
Murphy said the evidence of Public Accounts Committee (PAC) chairman John McGuinness TD was inconsistent, as he told RTÉ interviewer Richard Crowley in 2016 that he had not made any notes following a January 2014 meeting in a Dublin hotel car park with Callinan.
However in March 2017, McGuinness produced notes of the meeting to the tribunal.
Murphy said that McGuinness also claimed on RTÉ that he had not spoken with Fianna Fáil party leader Micheál Martin about the meeting. Martin told the tribunal last December that he was informed of the meeting.
The meeting had been characterised as somehow secret or clandestine, Murphy said, but this was not the case. The location, in a Dublin hotel car park, was chosen as McGuinness was eager to get home to his Kilkenny constituency, and it was easier for Callinan to travel to a meeting at Newlands Cross on the way out of city than in the city centre.
Murphy said it was also Mr Callinan’s position that comptroller and auditor general Seamus McCarthy was incorrect in his recollection of a conversation before a PAC meeting in January 2014, and that Fine Gael TD John Deasy had “misconstrued what was said”.
Callinan’s case was that he was asked about allegations regarding Sergeant McCabe by  McCarthy, and had told him that the allegations were investigated and the DPP directed no prosecution.
Callinan also said he had told Deasy that not all of the allegations made by Sergeant McCabe had been proven, not that McCabe could not be trusted.
Philip Boucher-Hayes
Murphy said that RTÉ journalist Philip Boucher-Hayes’ account of a conversation with the then commissioner in December 2013 contained a number of inconsistencies, and it was unlikely that the journalist would have prevented a broadcast going ahead because of a disagreement over what questions Callinan should answer on air.
The chairman should also consider the impact of public commentary on memory, Murphy said, as by the time the witnesses came forward in 2017 there had been “a vast tsunami of public discourse” about McCabe.
Murphy also said that former garda press officer Superintendent David Taylor was not a witness who was in any way credible or whose evidence could be relied upon.
There was also no evidence of any communication between former commissioner Nóirín O’Sullivan and journalist Debbie McCann in relation to McCabe, Mr Murphy said.
Murphy also said there was no evidence produced to show O’Sullivan had in any way influenced broadcasts by RTÉ journalist Paul Reynolds about a leaked copy of the report of the O’Higgins Commission of Investigation.
Maurice McCabe is ‘entitled to be vindicated’
Sergeant Maurice McCabe was entitled to be vindicated as truthful by the Charleton tribunal, his barrister has said in closing submissions.
“He doesn’t come here as a plaster saint and he doesn’t say that he got everything right,” Michael McDowell SC told the tribunal.
But he is entitled to be vindicated as a man who has been truthful, not only at the O’Higgins Commission but also in this tribunal, and that he is well motivated.
The O’Higgins Commission of Investigation looked at complaints by Sergeant McCabe about policing on the Cavan-Monaghan division. The Charleton tribunal had been looking at allegations that there was a smear campaign against McCabe.
McDowell said there was no evidence that RTÉ journalist Philip Boucher-Hayes had any motive to make up his account of his conversation with garda commissioner Martin Callinan in December 2013, and other witnesses had confirmed that Boucher-Hayes had told them about the conversation.
Comptroller and Auditor General Seamus McCarthy was a public servant and “had no basis whatsoever to impugn Mr Callinan”, McDowell said.
Car park meeting
McDowell said that McCarthy’s evidence of what he was told by Callinan before a Public Accounts committee (PAC) meeting on 23 January 2014 confirmed to some extent what John McGuinness TD said he was told in a car park meeting with Callinan on the following day.
McDowell said that Fine Gael TD John Deasy had been sympathetic to Callinan’s position on whether McCabe should give evidence before the PAC, and there was no reason to suppose Deasy held any malice towards Callinan.
McDowell said that Shane Murphy SC on behalf of the Garda Commissioner was asking the tribunal to consider that McGuinness invented “a highly malicious story” and was re-telling it knowing it to be false.
McDowell said this would mean believing that a note of the meeting made afterwards by McGuinness was “a piece of forged documentation invented to corroborate his account”, and that the tribunal should also doubt the evidence of Fianna Fáil leader Micheal Martin, who said he was told about the meeting some weeks later.
McDowell asked if the fact that phones used by Callinan, Nóirín O’Sullivan and Superintendent David Taylor in 2013 and 2014 could not be located was a coincidence or a deliberate policy to make them unavailable.
McDowell said it was likely that some journalists were negatively briefed about Sergeant McCabe by former press officer Superintendent Taylor.
He said there was not “a simple binary choice” that Taylor was either credible or not credible as a witness. McDowell said it was unusual that Taylor was reinstated and disciplinary proceedings dropped after the the findings of the Clerkin report, which found he was leaking information to journalists.
“The attitude exhibited in the witness box by Superintendent Taylor seems to have had about it an acquiescence and an willingness not to fight his corner and to rely on entirely formulaic statements of evidence in circumstances which must attract a degree of suspicion,” McDowell said.
‘Journalistic gossip’
Rossa Fanning SC, on behalf of Independent News & Media (INM), said there was no evidence that INM was used even inadvertently as part of a smear campaign against McCabe.
Any fair examination would show INM reported fairly on McCabe’s allegations, and that often its coverage was favourable to him, Fanning said. Journalistic gossip was not relevant to the tribunal, and journalistic clashes as to the currency of gossip were of no probative value to the tribunal, Fanning said.
Counsel said there were three disputes which concerned INM, involving journalists Ann Harris and Gemma O’Doherty, and academic Colum Kenny.
“The tribunal should exercise caution and restraint in not deciding things, it is not for the tribunal to decide,” Fanning said.
He said that if the tribunal did take a view on the differences between evidence, then in respect of Harris, it should prefer the evidence of Fionnán Sheahan and Ian Mallon.
He said there was no objective evidence that the termination of Gemma O’Doherty’s employment had anything to do with garda interference.
Fanning said that journalist Tom Brady was “emphatic” that he did not have a discussion with Colum Kenny, in the presence of RTE journalist Paul Reynolds or otherwise, and never had a discussion of the kind outlined to the tribunal by Kenny.
Closing remarks
In closing remarks, the chairman Mr Justice Peter Charleton thanked all those who had worked to make the tribunal a success since it began, and the members of the public who had attended its sittings.
“I couldn’t have done any better, because I have worked with the best,” the chairman said.
The chairman said he expected to complete his report in October.","The comment was made by a barrister for An Garda Síochána.",6,0,0,14175,"Jun 29th 2018, 3:52 PM"

Selected amongst eight interchange players with four to be omitted as the final squad was announced today, the Rower-Inistioge clubman made the cut and secured his start.
“In exciting news for Saints fans, Darragh Joyce’s years’ worth of hard work have paid off as the Irishman runs out in the red, white and black for the first time on Sunday,” the team news statement reads.
“Joyce earns his debut on the back of a string of impressive VFL performances, and the 21-year-old 194cm defender comes in for the omitted Logan Austin.”

The debut comes as a major Aussie Rules breakthrough for Joyce, who has been in action of late for St Kilda’s reserve team Sandringham in the Victorian Football League.
“It’s all paying off,” he told saints.com.au, adding that his Mam was making the trip over to watch.
“It’s been a big journey for me, so to get here, there’s been a lot of hard work over the last year, but hopefully it’s the first of many.”

He said: “I would like to thank the firefighters for their efforts during this period and I’m asking the public to be extra vigilant with all possible sources of ignition, for example discarded cigarette butts, disposable barbecues, and to report any illegal or suspicious activity in relation to fires to An Garda Síochána.”
Assistance to tackle the blazes this week has been provided from a number of state agencies, including helicopters from the Air Corps and Coillte attending a number of incidents.
The fire service has also coordinated with the National Parks and Wildlife service, while Civil Defence volunteers and fire service officers are patrolling at risk areas constantly and reporting back.
Drones are also set to be deployed this weekend to provide an “invaluable overview” of difficult locations.
The Defence Forces are also on standby to respond if emergency services are stretched due to the fires.","At the peak of the fires yesterday, 70 firefighters around the county were tackling blazes.",211,0,0,11285,"Jun 29th 2018, 2:58 PM"
1197,222,"13-year-old boy accused of murdering Ana Kriegel denied bail",https://www.thejournal.ie/ana-kriegel-courts-4099487-Jun2018/,"A 13-YEAR-OLD boy accused of the murder of Kildare schoolgirl Ana Kriegel has been refused bail by Mr Justice Robert Eagar at the High Court.
The boy, who cannot be named because he is a minor, has been charged with the murder of 14-year-old Anastasia Kriegel at Glenwood House, Laraghcon, Clonee Road, Lucan, Co. Dublin on 14 May, contrary to common law.
Anastasia, known as Ana, who was adopted from Russia at the age of two, left her home in Leixlip, at about 5pm on 14 May and she did not return.
Her parents were unable to contact her phone and alerted gardaí. Her body was found at a disused farmhouse three days later.
After he was charged, the teen had been remanded in custody to the Oberstown detention centre on 25 May by the Dublin Children’s Court, which does not have power to adjudicate on the issue of bail in murder cases.
However, he launched a bail application at the High Court sitting in Cloverhill which commenced before Mr Justice Eagar on Wednesday.
Detective Inspector Mark O’Neill who is leading the investigation had objected to bail.
Strict reporting restrictions were imposed by the judge who delivered his ruling this afternoon. He said the court was refusing to grant bail.
The teenager was accompanied to the proceedings by his parents, his grandfather and barrister Niall Nolan and a solicitor.
Dressed in a green jumper and black jeans, he sat silently with his family, at some points leaning his head on his mother’s shoulder during the almost hour-long proceedings.
The media could report the outcome of the application, Mr Justice Eagar told counsel for the State Aideen Collard.

The teenager, who will remain in custody, has faced three hearings already in the Children’s Court which last dealt with the case on Monday.

At that hearing, Inspector O’Neill said: “As you would appreciate it is quite an extensive investigation and we are working very hard to make sure matters are expedited.”
The boy is scheduled to appear again at the Children’s Court on 23 July next for directions from the Director Public Prosecutions to be conveyed.
At his first hearing, on 25 May, Inspector O’Neill told the court: “In reply to that charge after caution, he had nothing to say.” Legal aid had been granted after the court was told the teen’s age and that he was a school child.
There has been no indication yet as to how he intends to plead.

1198,179,"Irish Water set to announce specific bans on water use",https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-water-hosepipe-ban-4098915-Jun2018/,"Updated Jun 29th 2018, 2:18 PM
IRISH WATER HAS said this afternoon that it will need to utilise its powers to restrict water use, and will announce a number of activities that should be banned while supply remains critical “shortly”.
It has since announced a hosepipe ban will be put in place from Monday 2 July in the Greater Dublin Area.
Yesterday, Irish Water began lowering night-time water pressure levels in the Greater Dublin Area to the minimum level.
In the Greater Dublin Area, Irish Water said it can sustainably and safely produce 610 million litres of water supplies and demand around the country. However, in recent days demand has reached 615 megalitres.
In a statement, Irish Water said that the need for urgent conservation efforts must be conveyed to the public as drought conditions continue, but that it was willing to exercise its powers under legislation to take action.
It said: “Irish Water will make and publicise a number of orders shortly which will designate activities which must be banned for a period while the supply remains critical. Ultimately, the objective of water saving and responsible water use must rely primarily on public cooperation.
However, these drought orders will provide certain powers of enforcement to be used where necessary in support of the urgent need to preserve valuable and increasingly scarce water resources to meet essential social and economic needs.
Speaking to RTÉ Radio One’s Morning Ireland earlier, Eamon Gallon, General Manager of Irish Water said that “if the drought is prolonged, water restrictions could become unavoidable if demand doesn’t stop”.
Gallon confirmed that Irish Water is considering the possibility of a hosepipe ban in some areas of the country, including Dublin.
He said that under Section 58 of the Water Supply Act 2007, Irish Water has “powers to introduce measures to suppress demands to restricting certain non-essential activity”.
Before making an order the water services authority must give public notice of its intention to make such order and the period for which the order will remain in force through advertising in the public press or broadcast announcements on television or local or national radio, Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government John Paul Phelan said in the Dáil earlier this week.
The minister said such provisions are well established in other European and international jurisdictions.
Gallon added: “We’d have to publish notifications in newspapers and broadcast on radio and television and we have to give a reasonable period … seven days notice would be the normal period.”
“We’re hoping that we don’t have to act on this on a widespread basis.”
Irish Water has never used the Section 56 provision before, according to Gallon.
“But we’re heading into a situation now where all options have to be considered,” he said.
Current legislation
On Wednesday, Fine Gael TD Alan Farrell raised the issue of the pressure on Ireland’s water supply during this week’s hot weather, stating that restrictions under the Water Services Act 2007 should be implemented.
Speaking in the Dáil, Farrell said it is appropriate to look at the implementation of hosepipe bans, administered either through Irish Water or through the local authorities.

“This is a serious issue that will need to be addressed until such time as the capital and, indeed, other parts of the country have a water supply capable of withstanding more than a few days of sunshine. Today is a beautiful day. The temperature is in the high twenties in Dublin. I am sure it is higher elsewhere in the country,” he said.
Replying to Dublin North TD, the minister said Irish Water is prepared to use section 56 of the 2007 legislation.
“It has the capability under law to act when it finds treated water is at an unacceptably low-level,” he said.
Phelan said that under the Water Services Act 2007 there are already statutory provisions for the introduction of a such a ban and other restrictions designed to conserve water supplies during times of drought.
It also provides for a fine of €125 for breach of such restrictions.
These arrangements can come into force when a water services authority – which effectively means Irish Water – is of the opinion that a serious shortage of water supplies exists or is imminent in an area, he explained.
This would typically be during or following a prolonged period of dry weather but, in any event, it is possible for Irish Water to make such an order where demand is expected to exceed supply and it becomes necessary to restrict the use of water supplies including restricting certain activities involving the use of water.
The minister said that specified activities which may be restricted include watering a garden, watering of recreational parks or sports grounds, irrigating or spraying crops, washing vehicles, the provision of commercial washing services for a vehicle or trailer, or filling or replenishing a swimming pool or an artificial pond or lake.
In practice, the restrictions may apply to specified activities for all or specified parts of the day.

MET ÉIREANN HAS extended its Status Yellow – High Temperature warning until 10pm tomorrow as Ireland continues to be baked in the current heatwave.
Temperatures in the high 20s have been widely recorded today, with the highest reading coming from Shannon Airport where the mercury reached 28.6 degrees Celsius at 1pm.
Tomorrow is forecast to bring temperatures in excess of 27 degrees Celsius in Connacht, Munster and parts of south Leinster.
A Status Yellow alert urges people to be aware of the dangers of the weather and to allow them to take action to remain safe.
The HSE’s advice is for people to stay out of the sun between 11am and 3pm, as parts of the country will have temperatures over 30 degrees with coastal areas reaching as high as 28 degrees.

The HSE has also advised people to apply sunscreen if you have to go out in the sun, and avoid extreme physical exertion like sport, DIY or gardening when the sun is at its hottest.
Earlier this week, consultant dermatologist at St James’s Hospital Dr Patrick Ormond highlighted how “over 75% of the population in Ireland have ‘Celtic skin type’ where we freckle and burn easily”.

“People with a fair complexion need to be extra careful in the sun,” he said with sun exposure increasing the risk of skin cancer. “Protect yourself from unnecessary sun exposure today, and your skin will thank you for the rest of your life.”
This morning in Wicklow, raging gorse fires have caused the Military Road to be closed between Sally Gap and Glencree. Emergency services are at the scene and continue to fight the blazes.
Water restrictions remain in place today with the hot weather set to continue into next week.
Yesterday, Irish Water had identified 100 water supply schemes around the country that are now at risk as it urges people to conserve water as drought risk looms.
The company remains very concerned about the possibility of having to impose long-term restrictions on water, and said it will become “unavoidable” if the dry conditions persist, as they are forecast to.
However, some relief may be on the way as showers could return in parts of the country on Sunday.
“It will be mostly dry with sunny spells or hazy sunshine on Sunday but showers are likely to affect western and southern areas, and later there’s a signal for heavy showers to come up from the south to affect Munster,” Met Éireann said.
Looking ahead to next week, warm weather will continue with hazy sunshine, but not as hot as this week.

However, it’s important for the Dubliner to remember the good times from his three-year spell at Peterborough United.
“That FA Cup game against Chelsea was probably the pinnacle. Going into it, I was playing well every week and enjoying my football — although I probably should have seen red early in the game,” he laughs, recalling a meaty challenge on Cesc Fabregas in a 4-1 defeat to the Premier League giants at Stamford Bridge in January 2017.

“It was an amazing day, playing in front of over 40,000, spraying the ball around against some of the players we’re all watching on TV now at the World Cup. The result was probably never going to go our way, but we gave a good account of ourselves. It was an unbelievable experience. But you have to take the good with the bad, and some bad times came after that.”
For Forrester, the importance of focusing on those first 18 months at Peterborough instead of what came afterwards stems from a desire to rediscover his best form with his new club. Earlier this month, the 25-year-old midfielder signed a three-year deal with Aberdeen, who finished second to Celtic in the Scottish Premiership last season.
Expectations were high when Forrester joined Peterborough in August 2015. That he delivered on them with interest during the first half of his time at the League One club came as no surprise to those who witnessed his development in the SSE Airtricity League — first at Bohemians, but most prominently with St Patrick’s Athletic.
A brief visit to YouTube to savour his best bits can evolve into an extensive expedition. As Pat’s clinched the Premier Division title in 2013 and the FAI Cup a year later, Forrester assembled a spectacular array of goals and assists which highlighted his ability to produce the extraordinary with a ball at his feet.
When Peterborough secured his services three summers ago, Forrester’s transition to English football was seamless. Graham Westley, Peterborough’s manager, compared him to Michael Carrick. He was included in an extended Ireland squad for two friendlies ahead of Euro 2016. He lit up an FA Cup tie against West Bromwich Albion, who were later reported to have enquired about signing him. When the highlights were shown on Match of the Day, he was singled out for praise by Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer.
Having picked up the club’s player of the year award at the end of his first season, Forrester was rewarded by Peterborough with the captain’s armband and an improved three-year contract. He continued to impress during his second campaign at London Road, with chairman Darragh MacAnthony predicting that his compatriot would eventually be sold for “millions and millions” in the aftermath of the aforementioned clash with Chelsea.

That trip to Stamford Bridge ultimately came to be regarded as a turning point for Chris Forrester at Peterborough, but not for the right reasons. The following weekend, he held himself directly responsible for two of the goals they leaked in a 5-1 hammering at Bury. It was the first of nine defeats they’d endure in a 13-game spell. As the wheels came off for Peterborough, Forrester admits that his own form also took a nosedive.
After being sent off for dissent in a defeat to Walsall, he was criticised by manager Grant McCann, who relieved him of the captaincy at the end of the season. McCann alluded to Forrester’s performances being impacted by “personal issues”, with the player later being afforded a spell of leave at home in Dublin. A turbulent period culminated with a place on Peterborough’s transfer list in May.
At Fota Island Resort in Cork, where Aberdeen have based themselves this week for pre-season training, Forrester is turning over a new leaf. Discussing the challenges he encountered as his best form abandoned him over the past 18 months, he believes now that the captaincy ultimately proved to be a burden he wasn’t prepared to shoulder at the age of 23.
“I had a dip in form and I lost a lot of confidence in myself. Being away from home didn’t help either,” says Forrester, who has a young daughter back in Dublin. “When you’re feeling down like that, you need people around you. Maybe I didn’t have enough of the right people around me to help pick me out of the rut. You find out who your true friends are when you’re down like that. I learned a lot from it. I know better for it now.
“The captaincy was probably a factor. There was an awful lot of weight on my shoulders all of a sudden. The first six months was brilliant, and then the results started going badly and the pressure built up. That’s the way it is when you’re the captain. There’s more of a focus on you when things aren’t going well. I was never used to being a captain and the pressure on me then was just too much to handle.
“There was a game against Bury where I gave away a couple of goals and we were beaten 5-1. That was when I really started to feel myself dipping. It was a constant dip after that, bar one or two good performances here and there. I could never find the consistency to get me going again. If I had a performance that was 8/10 or 9/10, the next week I might get 10 touches of the ball in a whole game.

The pressure of captaincy took its toll.

“You hear it often that there’s no way you can be unhappy when you’re earning good money to kick a ball around a pitch. But there’s a lot of added pressure that’s not factored into comments like that. You’re trying to deal with other people’s opinions, as well as how you feel about yourself.
“I try not to pay attention to what other people think, but when someone is telling you that you’re a bad footballer then you’re going to starting asking yourself why they’re saying that. I think that has a lot to do with how you hear about so many people in football feeling down these days. There are a lot of demands and some people can’t deal with them as well as others. It’s important to respect that.
“But I’ve learned so much over the last year. It’s a fickle game at times. I suppose you have to take it all with a pinch of salt because if someone tells you that you’re great then you can’t get carried away with that either.”
If the second half of his stint in Peterborough left Forrester wounded, the healing process has been accelerated by the faith shown in him by Derek McInnes. The Aberdeen manager explained earlier this week that Forrester has been on his radar for the past four years.
Having generally been deployed in a deep-lying midfield berth at Peterborough, Forrester is keen to return to the type of advanced role in which he previously thrived. His first outing in an Aberdeen shirt could come in tomorrow’s friendly against Cobh Ramblers [2pm].
He says: “I want to be involved in goals and assists, not sitting in front of the back four and passing the ball sideways and backwards. I want to be an important player and I think the gaffer sees me that way too. To feel wanted is an amazing thing. When your gaffer is backing you, you’re going to fight for him. Hopefully I can do that higher up the pitch.”
Forrester has committed the next three years of his career to Aberdeen.

Ireland hasn’t often produced players who can weave the type of magic that Chris Forrester is capable of. Wearing the green jersey may currently seem like a pipe dream, given his recent difficulties, but having previously forced his way into Martin O’Neill’s extended squad, doing so again is a longer-term objective.
“I just want to get back in form at club level first,” Forrester says. “If my performances are deemed worthy of an Ireland call-up, I’ll be over the moon. It’s something I’ve always wanted, so much so that I couldn’t even put into words what it would actually mean for me and my family. If that ever comes around, I’ll be unbelievably happy. Hopefully it’s on the horizon. If it comes, I’ll be ready.”
When Peterborough placed 13 players on their transfer list at the end of last season, current manager Steve Evans remarked that although he has never regretted showing any player the door, Forrester has the ability to buck that trend. The Irish midfielder’s plan now is to ensure that Peterborough’s loss becomes Aberdeen’s gain.
“My time at Peterborough was enjoyable for the most part but I really feel like I’ve left the last 18 months behind me now,” he says. “I think this season will be massive for me. It’s a clean slate. It’s about tapping into that first 18 months at Peterborough again.
“My mindset is so positive at the moment. Speaking with the gaffer, I can see the positive effect he’s having on me already. It’s driving me to push myself to the next level. Getting there is what I intend on doing.”

FORMER ANGLO IRISH Irish Bank CEO David Drumm has pleaded guilty to authorising or permitting illegal loans to be given to ten businessmen in 2008 to buy shares in the bank.
Drumm (51) of Skerries, Co Dublin was transferred to Dublin Circuit Criminal Court this morning from Mountjoy Prison, where he is currently serving a six-year sentence for conspiracy to defraud and false accounting.
Wearing a white polo t-shirt and blue jeans, Drumm stood in the dock and replied “guilty” to ten charges of providing the loans to the so-called Maple 10 group of developers and businessmen.
Drumm pleaded guilty to ten counts of authorising or permitting Anglo Irish Bank to give unlawful financial assistance for the purchase of bank shares to Brian O’Farrell, Gerard Conlon, Gerard Maguire, John McCabe, Joseph O’Reilly, Patrick Kearney, Patrick McKillan, Seamus Ross and Sean Reilly between 10 and 17 July 2008.
He had been due to face trial in October but this has now been cancelled.
Paul O’Higgins SC, prosecuting, said the DPP intends to withdraw the remaining 21 charges listed on the indictment against Drumm.
Drumm was jailed last week after a jury returned unanimous verdicts of guilty on a charge of conspiracy to defraud and false accounting, following an 87-day trial.

Former South Yorkshire chief superintendent David Duckenfield (73) will now face 95 charges of gross negligence manslaughter for his actions on the day on 15 April 1989.
Another fan of the Liverpool football team would later die of injuries sustained in the tragedy, bringing the full death toll to 96.
As crowds gathered at the stadium in Sheffield on that day, Liverpool fans were killed in a crush. Hundreds more were injured.
Up until very recently, almost three decades after this disaster, no criminal proceedings have been taken against anyone.
The families of those who died had waged a long battle to get justice for their loved ones, as Liverpool fans were initially vilified for being culpable in the tragedy.
Duckenfield is one of a number of police officers charged for his role in the tragedy.
Judge Sir Peter Openshaw today at Preston Crown Court lifted the “stay” that had been placed on Duckenfield facing charges, meaning he will face trial in the near future, the BBC reported.

Raymond McCord, a campaigner for victims of the Troubles, took a judicial review, arguing that it is not clear in the Good Friday Agreement or Article 3.1 of the Irish Constitution if a majority in favour of a united Ireland is required in both jurisdictions on the island of Ireland or if a combined majority of the people of Ireland is all that is required in order for a border poll to be called.
He said the current criteria gives the Northern Ireland Secretary (currently Karen Bradley) “unfettered discretion” as to when a poll can be called and said procedures are too vague.
How and when a border poll is held 
McCord was seeking the secretary to publish a policy document as a matter of urgency, setting out the circumstances in which a poll would be held.
According to the Good Friday Agreement (GFA), a border poll can only be called by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.
The agreement says the secretary can order a border poll:
If at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should …form part of a united Ireland.
The agreement also provides for the people of the island of Ireland to exercise their right of self-determination by agreement between the people of North and South.
The GFA states:
It is for the people of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively and without external impediment, to exercise their right of self-determination on the basis of consent, freely and concurrently given, North and South, to bring about a United Ireland, accepting that this right must be achieved and exercised with and subject to the agreement and consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.
If such a vote passed, the process of Irish unification would begin.

McCord, aged 62, took simultaneous action against the Irish State and the Northern Ireland Secretary.
Lack of transparency
In his affidavit to the Belfast court, he argued that as a matter of “transparency” both governments should set out their policies as to how and when a border poll should be held, stating that it is a “matter of fundamental constitutional importance” for the citizens of Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, Britain and the EU.
“Uncertainty and the lack of transparency in Northern Ireland have historically not be good for peace and open to abuse,” he said.
In his ruling yesterday, Mr Justice Paul Girvan said he was “wholly unpersuaded by the argument that the Secretary of State be bound by a policy detailing the way in which that flexible and politically sensitive power is bound to be exercised”.
It continued:
The court cannot intervene merely because it considers that a production of publication of such a policy would be sensible or desirable. It can only intervene if as a matter of law the Secretary of State is obliged to make and publish such a policy.
Discretionary poll to call a border poll 
The judge said that the current approach appears “entirely apt in the context of decision-making by the Secretary of State in relation to the discretionary power to call a border poll”.
“The statutory framework does not specify the matters which must be taken into account or left out of account in deciding whether a border poll is or is not appropriate. In essence it must be for the Secretary of State to decide what matters should be taken into account on the political question of the appropriateness of a poll.
“The Secretary of State has indicated that a form of published policy prescribing how the discretion should be exercised and which pre-determines how public opinion should be assessed may prove unduly restrictive and not in the public interest.
“This is a tenable and rational conclusion on her part. Her decision not to make or publish a policy in relation to the exercise of her discretionary power cannot be impugned and there is no legal requirement to have a policy in place to govern and qualify how the broad discretionary power is to be exercised.”
Not required to enunciate a policy
The matter of when and who should vote in a border poll falls on the Secretary of State to conclude, said the judge, adding that she is not required as a matter of law to enunciate a policy on how the pool of voters should be determined in advance of her exercising her powers. The judge ruled to dismiss McCord’s application.
Speaking to RTÉ outside the court yesterday, McCord expressed disappointment at the outcome.
“For me, it’s about taking politics out of the border poll, and putting policies in because quite clearly the border poll is being abused.
“And I’m disappointed in what the judge said, but we’ll appeal it.”
Fianna Fáil Senator Mark Daly, who has supported McCord’s case, said yesterday’s ruling was a “tragic result”.
He said it is case that “politics rather than policy is what will decide when a referendum on a united Ireland is held, but as we have seen all too often policy neglect seldom goes unpunished”.

Foster last night became the first DUP leader to attend an LGBT event as she spoke at a PinkNews event in Stormont.
While the DUP has blocked marriage equality in the North, Foster said that didn’t mean she didn’t respect LGBT people.
“I look at you as my neighbours and my fellow citizens.
“I wanted to send a clear message from this event, that we are all someone’s child and we are all a valued part of this wonderful place we call home.
“I wanted to use this platform to encourage meaningful engagement rather than megaphone diplomacy.”
However, she said that her position on marriage wouldn’t change and she asked that it be respected.
“I believe I can hold to my principled position, particularly in relation to the definition of marriage, whilst respecting the diversity across our society.
“In Northern Ireland we have a very strong faith community.
Just because we disagree on marriage does not mean that I don’t value the LGBT community. It is not a zero sum game.
“All I ask in return is that my, and our views, are also respected if not agreed with.

Whilst we disagree, this does not prevent us from finding common values to keep Northern Ireland moving forward.”
Northern Ireland remains the only part of the UK where same-sex marriage is still banned. It was legalised in England and Wales in July 2013, and Scotland in February 2014.
The issue of marriage equality has been a central sticking point in the talks to restore power-sharing in Stormont, with Sinn Féin calling for it to be legalised and DUP strongly opposed.

CO-CREATOR OF Father Ted Graham Linehan says that his cancer is clear, just two days after declaring that he would need to undergo chemotherapy.
Linehan, who co-wrote the seminal clerical priestcom with regular writing partner Arthur Mathews, revealed earlier this week that he had been undergoing treatment for testicular cancer.
He stated that, following diagnosis, the cancer was gotten rid of “pretty quickly”, but that a course of chemotherapy would be necessary in order to make sure the disease didn’t recur.
He has now updated the situation via his prolific Twitter feed to say that, in fact, the disease has cleared.
“Well holy shit. I just saw my oncologist. Everything’s clear,” he wrote.

THOUSANDS OF TOURISTS have been stranded as Bali shuttered its international airport following a volcanic eruption on the Indonesian resort island that shot a thick plume of ash and smoke thousands of metres into the sky, officials said.
The early morning closure of Ngurah Rai airport sparked the cancellation of nearly 280 flights to and from the tropical paradise with some 15,700 passengers affected, according to revised figures from an airport spokesman.
The initial numbers given were nearly 450 flights cancelled and 75,000 travellers affected. The spokesman did not give a reason for the dramatic revision.
A striking orange-red glow could be seen at the top of Mount Agung’s crater after it shot smoke and ash some 2,000 metres into the sky yesterday evening.
The airport was closed early this morning after a pilot flying overhead detected traces of volcanic ash as high as 23,000 feet.

Ash
Ash is dangerous for planes as it makes runways slippery and can be sucked into their engines.
Bali’s main international gateway will be closed until at least this evening, according to officials, who added that two other domestic airports were also shut.
The fresh activity threatens to create travel chaos after an Agung eruption in November stranded thousands and pounded Bali’s lucrative tourism industry and wider economy.
Tens of thousands of locals fled to evacuation centres after last year’s eruption.
The volcano is about 75 kilometres from Bali’s tourist hub in Kuta.
Australian visitor Rod Bird came early to the airport only to be told his flight back to Perth had been cancelled for the second time.
An earlier flight on AirAsia was called off before the airport was shuttered early this morning.
“They told us the volcano is going off so they rebooked us for this morning and we got here at 5am only to be turned away again. So we’ve had two cancelled flights,” Bird told AFP.
“Well it’s Bali, these things happen and we are fine with it. We just miss the kids,” he added.

Stranded
Thousands were stranded at the airport or area hotels today, but it was not immediately clear how many tourists were unable to leave the island.
Despite the eruption, Agung’s status remained on alert status, the second highest danger warning.
There is a four-kilometre (2.5 mile) no-go zone around Agung’s peak.
Bali’s governor said officials were working on getting visitors on their way.
“We will try our best to find a solution so all visitors can continue their trip,” Made Mangku Pastika said.
Agung has been erupting periodically since it rumbled back to life last year.
Its last major eruption in 1963 killed around 1,600 people.
Indonesia is the world’s most active volcanic region and lies on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” where tectonic plates collide, causing frequent volcanic and seismic activities.

Ms Justice Caroline Costello made the suggestion in respect of dentists Michael Maguire and James Hiney, who operate their separate practices from a building they co-own at Market Point, Mullingar, Co Westmeath.
While they had worked well alongside each other for some years the High Court has heard that the working environment between the two is now “toxic”.
In proceedings that came before the High Court earlier this week, Mr Maguire has claimed his staff were put under surveillance by a secret camera installed in a hole in the ceiling by Mr Hiney.
Mr Hiney claims the camera was put in for security reasons and not used to spy on Mr Maguire or his staff.
Mr Maguire does not accept that explanation and now seeks various injunctions against Mr Hiney including one preventing the defendant from monitoring and surveillance of his employees.
Mr Maguire also seeks orders that all data including patient lists be returned to him as well as an order for damages that his patients are not solicited and any proposed construction works at the premises be halted.
Ms Justice Caroline Costello granted Mr Maguire, represented by Stephen Byrne Bl, permission to serve short notice of injunction proceedings, on an ex parte basis, against Mr Hiney.
When the matter returned before the Judge yesterday afternoon Mr Byrne told the court that the case could be adjourned to late July after the parties had reached an intermediate agreement.
Undertakings had been agreed, on a without prejudice basis, including that Mr Hiney would not carry out any surveillance on Mr Maguire and his staff, that no construction would take place at the shared premises, and there would be no soliciting emails or texts sent to Mr Maguire’s patients.
The court also heard that Mr Hiney never intended to have any construction works carried out on the shared premises as long as Mr Maguire’s business was operating out of the building.
The Judge in adjourning the case said it would be better for all concerned of the dispute was resolved through mediation rather than in Court 3 of the Four Courts.
In a sworn statement to the court seeking the injunctions, Mr Maguire said there have been a host of issues between the dentists, ranging from petty complaints to serious allegations of criminal behaviour between the two.
He said Mr Hiney has made allegations against him, including assault defamation, harassment, vandalism, the withholding of information from insurers about the building they share, which Mr Maguire rejects.","One of the dentists claims a camera was installed to spy on his staff.",4,0,3,23327,"Jun 29th 2018, 8:03 AM"

Ciara Breen disappeared on 13 February 1997, after leaving her home in Dundalk to meet someone. She was never seen again.
A year ago, Bernadette told RTÉ’s Prime Time that “there are people out there who know” where her daughter is buried and urged them to come forward.

Source: TNS/ABACA
IN THE SHADE of a car park in Maryland’s capital Annapolis, three journalists from the Capital Gazette typed grimly away — still without news of colleagues killed or injured when a gunman stormed the publication earlier yesterday.
“We’re putting out a paper tomorrow,” vowed Chase Cook, one of six reporters at the daily, where the latest mass shooting to rock the United States left five people dead.
His photographer colleague Joshua McKerrow had his laptop perched on the back of a pick-up truck.
Their deadline had been pushed back to 9.30pm.
Chase was working from his smartphone — from which he could access the newspaper’s editorial system.
“We’re going to have a paper,” said the young man, who has worked since 2013 for The Capital, a local daily whose roots go back to 1727 — and which police believe was deliberately targeted in the attack.
“I don’t know what else to do except this,” he said. “We’re just doing our job.”
Chase was not inside the paper’s offices when the gunman — identified as a white man in his late 30s — burst in and opened fire.
“All I know is five people are dead,” he said.
Police were looking into social media threats received by the paper, which employs a small team of 13 journalists and photographers out of a ground floor office at 888 Bestgate Road — behind a glass door that usually stays shut.
‘War zone’

According to Phil Davis, one of the reporters who was inside at the time and tweeted an account of the assault, the gunman shot through the door and opened fire on staff inside — as others including himself hid under their desks.

Describing the attack to the Baltimore Sun, which owns the Capital Gazette, Davis said it “was like a war zone” inside, a situation that would be “hard to describe for a while.”
Davis said he was still hiding under his desk when the shooting stopped — and police swarmed the building taking the suspect into custody.
It took officers — trained to respond to the mass shootings that have become a regular occurrence in the country — just 60 seconds to arrive on site, according to an official.
The Baltimore Sun – which owns the Capital Gazette – identified the suspected shooter as Jarrod Ramos, who it said had a long-running dispute with the newspaper over a 2011 story “that covered a criminal harassment case against him”.
The acting police chief of Anne Arundel county Bill Krampf said that police did not yet know the shooter’s motive, but “we know that there were threats sent to the Gazette through social media.”
“We’re trying to confirm what account that was and we’re trying to confirm who actually sent them,” Krampf added.

I always knew I was different and that is really confusing at a young age. It was in the High School Musical era (circa 2006) when Gabriella Montez was breaking the hearts of my male classmates that I could pin it down, because it was Troy Bolton that was breaking mine.
‘I said no’
I remained in the closet for a further ten years. I remember in 2015, during the Marriage Equality Referendum, wearing a ‘Tá’ badge and being asked if I was gay. I said no.
But a year later, in the middle of sixth year, I made a huge step. I made an appointment with Sinead Murray-Lynch at Donegal Youth Service and with her guidance and support, along with that of BreakOUT (a local LGBT youth group), I came out to my friends and family.
The world did not stop spinning. My parents still loved me, and my friendships did not disintegrate. The most remarkable thing was it changed almost nothing in my day to day life except it felt like a weight was lifted. Diana Ross’ ‘I’m Coming Out’ quite accurately narrates this brief period of my life because it was a whirlwind of positive emotions.
Coming out continues
Three Prides later and coming out still continues. Just last week I was getting my hair cut and I was asked if I had a girlfriend by my hairdresser.
I no longer struggle with ‘I’m gay’. It rolls off the tongue with ease now, which is funny considering I had to came out with Snapchat to my sister, letter to my parents and Messenger to friends because I croaked at the word ‘gay’.
Overall, the support from my local youth service, my family, my teachers, and my friends was the most inspirational thing. I think I always knew they would support me, but the fear of coming out is incomprehensibly irrational. My only regret is not coming out sooner.
Ireland is world renowned for its hospitality, its generosity and – more recently – its insatiable desire to finally (102 years later) cherish all its children equally.

An unequal society
But behind the façade, we still live in a society that is unequal. Where opportunities afforded to you are limited through any deviation from the rugged, masculine, straight, white male or the pale white, innocent, straight female.
But this is about to change. The launch of the National LGBTI+ Strategy by Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Dr Katherine Zappone is the shot in the arm we need to continue our journey to full equality for all.
Yes, we have it better off than our LGBTI+ brothers, sisters and non-binary siblings who live in genuine, crippling fear for their lives in countries like Uganda, Saudi Arabia or Russia. But say that to our young people battling mental illness, trying to access PrEP, or being bullied in school day in day out for expressing their gender in a way which does not conform to that which they were assigned at birth.
We live in a country where homosexuality is not a crime; where same-sex marriage is legal; and where Gender Recognition exists. But this does not mean we have achieved the equality which the 1916 Leaders were talking about when they read the Proclamation from the steps of the GPO.

Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who heads a month-old anti-immigration government, had vetoed joint conclusions for the entire agenda of the summit in Brussels until his demands were finally met before dawn.
Italy has turned away a series of migrant boats in recent weeks, sparking a fresh political row three years after the bloc faced its biggest ever migration crisis.
“Today Italy is no longer alone. We are satisfied,” Conte, a former law professor who until recently was a virtual political unknown, told reporters following marathon talks described as “virulent”.
The 28 leaders agreed to consider setting up “disembarkation platforms” outside the bloc, most likely in north Africa, in a bid to discourage migrants boarding EU-bound smuggler boats.
Member countries could set up migrant processing centres — but only on a voluntary basis — to determine whether they returned home as economic migrants or admitted as refugees in willing states.
French President Emmanuel Macron said that “European cooperation enabled this”.
Merkel hails ‘good message’
The leaders also offered a concession to German Chancellor Merkel, who faces a rebellion from within her own coalition government, with moves to stop migrants registered in Italy and other EU countries from moving to Germany.
Merkel said: “After intensive discussion on what is perhaps the most challenging issue for the European union, it is a good message that we have adopted a joint text.”
She had earlier warned that “migration could end up determining Europe’s destiny” if it failed to reach an agreement.
The summit conclusions called on member countries to take “all necessary” steps to stop migrants initially arriving in countries such as Italy and Greece from moving on to Germany.
After allowing more than one million asylum seekers into Germany since 2015, Merkel faces an end-of-month deadline from her own interior minister to seal pacts to curb so-called secondary migration.
Italy’s stance has revived political tensions in the EU, despite the fact that arrivals have dipped by 96 percent since the peak of Europe’s migration crisis in 2015, and sparked warnings that authoritarian movements will take advantage of any failure to tackle migration.
Conte came to Brussels emboldened by the announcement of an upcoming visit to US President Donald Trump, who has hailed Rome’s tough stance, and who himself blocked the conclusions of a recent G7 leaders meeting on trade.
The Italian government demanded “concrete action” from other countries to help in the same way that they had after it refused to admit the rescue ships Aquarius, which docked later in Spain, and Lifeline, which went to Malta.

EU President Donald Tusk issued a fresh warning on the need for action on migration to stave off rising populism and authoritarianism, saying that “the stakes are high and time is short”.
“Some may think I am too tough in my proposals on migration, but trust me, if we don’t agree on them, then you’ll see some really tough proposals from some really tough guys,” the former Polish premier added.
But the leaders failed to agree on long-stalled plans to overhaul the bloc’s asylum rules, which say that migrants must be dealt with by the first country in which they arrive.
The plans include a permanent scheme to share migrants arriving in Italy and Greece around all other EU countries.
Former communist countries in Eastern Europe, particularly the authoritarian governments of Hungary and Poland, implacably oppose the plan.
Brexit was meanwhile largely relegated to the sidelines of this summit, with British Prime Minister Theresa May set to update leaders after admitting the need to make “faster” progress as she arrived at the venue.

The two ministers are due to spend a week in the Gaeltacht in a bid to improve their Irish.
While Flanagan has been to Irish college as a child, this will be Zappone’s first time.
Dáil business permitting, Flanagan and Zappone will be joining Government Chief Whip and Minister for the Irish language, Gaeltacht and the Islands Joe McHugh in Gleanncholmcille in Donegal.
When taking responsibility for the Gaeltacht office, McHugh was criticised for not being fluent in Irish.
At the time, he admitted his grasp of the teanga was “not great”.
But instead of letting it hold him back, McHugh asked the public to join him on his “journey” to bring his standard of the Irish language up to scratch. The minister is now fluent.
Flanagan told TheJournal.ie that he is looking forward to his few days in Donegal.
I’m really looking forward to casting the suit aside and immersing myself in Gaeltacht life. I love the Irish language and I don’t use it enough.
I did 5th and 6th class in Ring and even did a court case in Irish at one stage. I have become rusty since.
Flanagan said he is excited at the prospect of brushing up on his Irish. adding:
I am just hoping the busy justice schedule will allow me an uninterrupted few days.
Brushing up on their Irish
The news that two members of Cabinet want to learn more Irish comes as the government launches its five-year action plan for the Irish language 2018-2022.
Launching the nine action areas today, McHugh said the implementation of the plan is critical to the survival of the Irish language.
“The spirit of cooperation is central to this endeavour. By supporting each other, we, and the Irish language and the Gaeltacht, will thrive and prosper,” he said, adding:
And in a symbol of that deepening interest at Cabinet level both Minister for Children and Youth Affairs Katherine Zappone and Minister for Justice and Equality Charlie Flanagan will join me at the Gaeltacht summer college run by Oideas Gael in Gleanncholmcille in the coming weeks.
There you have two ministers leading by example and taking the plunge and coming to Donegal, for the crash course in our language.
McHugh said that like him, he expects the ministers to pick up a few extra words as Gaeilge.
“I’ve no doubt they’ll go away with more than a cupla focail and an important story to share with family, friends, colleagues and constituents. There’s plenty to learn in Gleanncholmcille and no shortage of craic – and anyone who ever spent any summers in the Gaeltacht will tell you that’s what it’s all about,” he said.
This is the kind of leadership you need to inspire revival. We hear talk about grassroots revival and here you have three members of Cabinet becoming part of that, taking the initiative themselves and trying to act as an inspiration for others.
Five-year action plan 
Within the plan itself there is a deep focus on education and early years.
New initiatives will see €3 million in support packages for the use of Irish in creches, nurseries, naonraí (playschool) in the Gaeltacht, schools and parents wishing to raise families in the Gaeltacht through Irish.
In addition, there will be two Irish language Early Years posts created within the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to further the development of Irish language provision in the early years sector in non-Gaeltacht areas.
A new grant system to cover 95% of cost of building a crèche in the Gaeltacht will also be established.
A digital strategy for the Irish language will also be set up, and RTÉ are to set up a new Irish language section on the RTÉ Player. A new RTÉ Irish language APP for kids will also be launched.
TG4 will continue to commission content from the independent sector in Gaeltacht areas,
with the expectation of establishing 300 jobs.
Publication of a new dictionary
Other aspects of the plan include a publication of a new English/Irish dictionary, and the establishment of an Irish language centre in Dublin.
Targets, which are contained in the 20-year strategy for the Irish language 2010-2030, have been incorporated into the five-year action plan.
In the next twenty years, the government wants to increase number of Irish speakers outside education circles from 83,000 to 250,000. It also wants to see a 25% increase in Irish speakers in Gaeltacht.
By 2030, the aim is to have two million people competent in Irish.","The government is today launching its five-year Irish Language plan which has a focus on early child education.",35,0,5,17224,"Jun 29th 2018, 6:30 AM"
1219,215,"Dentists will stop using metal fillings that have been used in teeth for 150 years",https://www.thejournal.ie/dental-fillings-4096952-Jun2018/,"THE USE OF dental amalgam fillings are to be phased out in Europe – and it’s for environmental reasons.
The use of the silver-coloured fillings, that contain several metals including mercury, is to be phased out gradually starting from this Sunday 1 July.
From then, dentists will no longer use amalgam fillings on the teeth of children under 15 years of age, or on pregnant or breastfeeding women (except for in limited circumstances).
The President of the Irish Dental Association Dr Kieran O’Connor said the new EU regulations are being brought in with the aim of reducing the amount of mercury in the environment.
He said that Ireland had signed the Minamata Convention on Mercury, which “brought about a global agreement to reduce environmental contamination caused by mercury”.
It includes a ban on new mercury mines, the phase-out of existing ones and the phase down of mercury use in a number of products and processes.
“Placing or removing amalgam fillings can cause mercury waste to be released into the environment and that is why its use is being phased down. However, it will continue to be a treatment option for all other patients for the time being,” he said.
But the fillings are safe
Dr Eamon Croke, who helped to produce the IDA’s patient information leaflet on this issue, stressed that dental amalgam fillings are safe.
“Dental amalgam has been in use for over 150 years and its safety and reliability has been well researched,” he said.
Many people who have amalgam fillings may be wondering about their safety. Many will have had these fillings for a long time and they will be working very well. Their removal is to be avoided because it usually leads to the creation of a larger cavity.
He added that there would be some cases where a dental amalgam filling would still be the best option, and in those cases the dentist would explain why.
Medical card patients should also note that dentists are not permitted to provide them with white fillings for their back teeth.
While the use of amalgam fillings may eventually stop completely, further research and testing of other filling materials is needed before amalgam can be replaced.","Although the fillings are perfectly safe, they carry a heavy environmental burden.",128,0,10,42419,"Jun 29th 2018, 6:15 AM"
1220,291,"'You were extra vigilant in taking advice on board': Cahalane credits The Rock for full-back gains",https://www.the42.ie/damien-cahalane-cork-clare-munster-final-4098226-Jun2018/,"CONFIDENCE, BOTH INDIVIDUALLY and collectively, has played a key part in Cork reaching back-to-back Munster SHC finals, according to full-back Damien Cahalane.
On Sunday, the Rebels clash with Clare in the final in Thurles (2pm), having been the only one of the five counties not to lose a game in the round-robin section of the competition. Cork coach John Meyler has pointed to the character of his team in helping to get them out of tight situations and Cahalane, ever-present at number 3, believes that confidence goes hand in hand with such a strong resolve.
“You have to go into every game confident in your own ability,” he says.
“If you are not confident in your own ability, to go out and get a performance – you might as well not go out. We are confident in our preparation and confident that we have done everything right to put ourselves in the best position.”
On a personal level, Cahalane has developed strongly and he affords credit to another Rebel full-back – Diarmuid O’Sullivan, a member of the Cork backroom team in 2016 and 2017 – in helping him to improve, along with a parallel growth in personal confidence.
“I suppose myself and Sully would be fairly close now,” he says, “he was very good with me in terms of the coaching he did with me over the last few years.
“I’ve a huge amount to thank him for, growing up as a Cork supporter, Diarmuid O’Sullivan was always a huge figure. When you got to be coached by him then, you were extra vigilant in taking advice on board from him.
“Definitely, everything that he has worked on with me over the last few years has been carried on this year.
“It was specialised coaching in that position as well, which was great, but a lot of it came from confidence too, and that came from management and when I got a vote of confidence from the Cork public and that probably fed into how I was playing afterwards.”
This year’s Munster championship began for Cork with a five-point win over Clare in Páirc Uí Chaoimh but Cahalane expects to face a very different animal on Sunday – especially as they have built their confidence in the interim.
“I wouldn’t think the first match has any relevance, to be honest,” he says.
“I knew going into game one against Clare, we knew that we would have to bring our A-game to get a performance against them. And even at that, you are still not guaranteed getting a result.
“They have improved in the meantime and we are going to have to go up and beyond what we did the first day. It is a whole new game, a game on its own merits and we just have to try and get a performance the next day.
“A huge thing for them, you can see the last couple of games, is their confidence. They seem to be very confident in what they are doing, they have one or two fellas coming back from injury which will be a big added bonus to them. I think the main thing now is they are playing with confidence. That has been their major improvement.”
Off the field, Cahalane is a busy man too, having recently opened a bar on Hanover St in Cork. While some players may not enjoy having to listen to customers talk sport, it’s not a problem for him.
“We are open nearly three weeks and it has been going great,” he says.
“We have had great support from the Cork public. I’m really happy with it, hopefully it’ll continue.
“I’ve done a bit of work behind the bar but mostly I am managing the place. We have good staff inside there, that have given me a great opportunity to live out my passion of playing hurling for Cork and for the moment, that is the priority with the Munster final coming up. I have a huge amount of praise and thanks for the staff for letting me do that.
“A lot of people don’t like talking about hurling outside of hurling but at the end of the day, I am a sports fan as well so I don’t mind chatting about Cork.”

1221,231,"Israel's embassy has stalled works planned for a Dublin office block over security concerns",https://www.thejournal.ie/israeli-embassy-dublin-office-2-4097382-Jun2018/,"THE ISRAELI EMBASSY in Ireland has stated that a planned redevelopment of Carrisbrook House in Dublin 4 “could be a significant threat to the security and privacy” of its operation.
Israel’s Dublin-based embassy, which is currently housed on the fifth floor of Carrisbrook House, has put a block on the plans for the building after it lodged an appeal against a decision by Dublin council which gave Spectre (Carrisbrook) Ltd the green light to revamp the office block.
Previously, the IDA’s €1 million a year expenditure on lease payments on the largely-empty Carrisbrook House came under the political spotlight.
Comptroller and auditor general Seamus McCarthy told a Public Accounts Committee hearing in July 2016 that it was difficult to market the property because of security risks as the Israeli embassy was a subtenant of the property.
As result, the property was 85% vacant for a number of years. Business Minister Heather Humphreys previously told the Dáil that the IDA exited the lease in December 2015 “as it was the least costly option for the State”.
The IDA’s lease agreement was not due to expire until 2034 and it cost the IDA €9.4 million to exit the lease.
However, Minister Humphreys said while it represented a significant amount, it was “a saving to the State of an estimated €13.65 million in comparison to maintaining the lease until completion”.

According to the company’s accounts, Spectre (Carrisbrook) Ltd, which was incorporated last year, is owned by Luxembourg Investment Company 112 S.á.r.l (1).
In a planning submission, Spectre (Carrisbrook) Ltd proposed external and internal alterations of the existing building. It planned to demolish some structures on the grounds in order to extend the office block.
The city council gave the plan to redevelop the building the go-ahead in spite of an objection lodged by Israel’s ambassador to Ireland, Ze’ev Boker, who noted that the embassy has been a tenant of Carrisbrook House since 1996.

He stated: “We wish to reserve our rights of quiet enjoyment of the 5th floor of the property and ensure that the embassy will be capable of its full and normal operation during the proposed works should planning permission be granted.”
Boker said that “a further concern is to ensure the security will be maintained at the property and its surrounding areas”.
He added: “We trust that our concerns regarding the likely significant disruption will be taken into account … given our unique position as the sole tenant in the property and the necessity to continue our function as an embassy.”
After the local authority’s decision to award planning permission to Spectre (Carrisbrook) Ltd, the embassy has now formally appealed the decision.
Objection
In its appeal, the embassy stated: “We ask the board to note that nothing in the appeal shall be construed as a waiver of the privileges and the immunity of the Embassy of Israel.”
The appeal claims that Dublin council failed to give due consideration to the Israeli Ambassador’s submission.
It added that the layout and design of the proposed extensions to the building could adversely impact on the privacy and security of the established embassy offices.
It also stated that the planned four-storey extension of the redevelopment “could be a significant threat to the security and privacy of the fifth floor”.
The embassy has requested that the board issue a notice for the applicant to make explicit provision for the continuation of the use of the fifth floor as an embassy and to amend the architectural design to address the embassy’s concerns.
A decision is due on the appeal later this year.","The embassy has been based out of the largely-empty Carrisbrook House in Ballsbridge since 1996.",25,0,0,16380,"Jun 29th 2018, 6:00 AM"
1222,289,"A Dublin developer has been advertising rentals within an apartment complex built without planning permission",https://www.thejournal.ie/larkfield-house-clondalkin-4091874-Jun2018/,"[image alt="4" src="http://cdn.thejournal.ie/media/2018/06/4-412-296x237.jpg" width="296" height="237" credit-source="Google%20Maps" caption="Larkfield%20House%2C%20in%20its%20former%20guise%20as%20the%20Liffey%20Valley%20Fitness%20gym" class="aligncenter" /end]
A DUBLIN DEVELOPER, who was denied permission to build 48 apartments at a location in west Dublin and then went ahead and built them anyway, has advertised those apartments online for rental within recent weeks.
Previously, it had been expected that a number of families living there who were at risk of homelessness may have been forced to vacate the property as a result of the planning issue, although that situation has yet to materialise.
Developer Cavvies Limited initially sought planning permission in July 2016, which was subsequently granted, to construct 27 apartments over three floors at the site of Larkfield House, on Coldcut Road in Clondalkin. The building had formerly been a gym.
The company subsequently reapplied for permission in May 2017 seeking to raise the number of apartments to 48 over four floors. That permission was denied by South Dublin County Council (SDCC).

In the end, 45 apartments were built on the site, which was then fully let, while the SDCC ruling was appealed to An Bord Pleanála. The planning body’s final decision upheld the denial of permission in March 2018. This means that there is currently no planning permission, and no fire safety (an application for a fire cert was rejected as invalid on 27 March, a week after the ABP decision), disability or compliance certificates in place for the property.
Enforcement notice
South Dublin County Council has since served the building with an enforcement notice, aimed at bringing it back within compliance. Should this notice not be complied with, the council (in theory) can bring District Court proceedings against the developer.
In recent weeks, however, apartments within the complex have been advertised for rental on at least two national property sites – Daft.ie and MyHome.ie.
“This is ethically completely wrong,” Sinn Féin Housing spokesperson Eoin Ó Broin told TheJournal.ie.
In both cases, the adverts were removed following requests for comment from the sites by both Ó Broin and TheJournal.ie.

The agent in question, Ray Cooke Auctioneers, did not reply to repeat requests for comment. The same agent had previously placed ads for an apartment within Larkfield House which appeared online earlier this year.
“There should be legislation in place to stop agents advertising properties like this,” said local councillor Mark Ward.
Interestingly, those properties were advertised without making reference to the property’s name, only to the fact it is sited on Coldcut Road. The reason for this is unclear (in ads placed prior to An Bord Pleanála’s decision, the property name was included).

Emergency accommodation
Prior to An Bord Pleanála refusing permission to Cavvies for the additional units, South Dublin County Council suspended the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) for many of the families that had been renting the apartments, some of whom had moved there from homeless or emergency accommodation situations.
20 such families were believed to be under threat. However, TheJournal.ie understands that none of those affected have as yet been forced to vacate the property, suggesting that rental adverts seen online apply to other empty apartments at the location.
Ó Broin says that the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE) has since guaranteed “that everyone in that property will get the higher rate of HAP”.
“A number of private renters have left,” said Sinn Féin councillor Ward. “A lot of people weren’t happy that they had entered into an agreement with a rogue planner.”
A spokesperson for the Department of Housing said that the situation is a matter for South Dublin County Council alone.
“Regarding planning enforcements, the minister and department are specifically precluded, under section 30 of the Planning Act, from becoming involved in any individual planning case, including the enforcement of any planning matter,” they said.
With regard to the HAP tenants affected, they added that the department had “confirmed with South Dublin County Council that the local authority had been engaging with these tenants and has been working, in co-operation with the DRHE, to assist those affected”.
SDCC declined to comment on the issue as it stands.

When contacted for comment, Cavvies director Vincent Cosgrave acknowledged his identity but then said: “I don’t know anything about Larkfield House, you have the wrong man.” The company did not respond to an email query.
Both Daft.ie and MyHome.ie removed the adverts in question when queried about same.
“As Ireland’s largest property portal we don’t manage the properties that advertisers place on the site directly,” a Daft spokesperson said.
Advertisers manage the content of their own ads. We have a list of terms and conditions for advertisers available. All ads have a report ad button and we do operate a notice and takedown policy.
Removed
“MyHome.ie was not aware that the apartment in question was located in a building that does not have the required certificates,” a spokesperson for that site meanwhile said.
Once this was brought to our attention the ad was removed from the website. We will be following this up directly with the agent concerned.
Most recently, last month, Cavvies launched another planning application, seeking to bring the number of residential units at the property down to 37 over five floors. That application was declared invalid by SDCC on 26 June.

“There is no criminal offence when properties like this are advertised, and it absolutely should be illegal,” said Ó Broin.
Alongside this, there should be legislation in place to make it an offence to have built structures that are not within building compliance. I’m asking the Minister to introduce legislation to make this a criminal offence.
As things stand, it’s illegal to rent this building. It has no planning permission, and it has no fire or completion certs lodged with the local authority.
He said that “in two, three, or six months those in the building could be forced to move out again”.
And that’s just wrong.

Thomas Fox also said he had no reason to fight with the Hutch family and it was “not his thing going around murdering people”.
Fox said he had tried to distance himself from his co-accused Jonathan Keogh, after Keogh told him there was a threat on his life. He said Keogh was “mixed up with big people” and he felt nervous in his company.
Earlier, the court heard Fox went to Mountjoy Garda Station after being persuaded by his mother and told officers he was there to “clear his name”. Fox said his father, Michael Taylor, had been killed in 2011 and he “couldn’t put another family through that”.
Fox is one of three Dubliners accused of murdering Hutch (36), nephew of Gerry “the Monk” Hutch. It is the State’s case that he was instrumental in planning the murder of Hutch.
The prosecution contend that Fox was parked near Avondale House in a white Ford Transit on the morning of the shooting but due to a change of plans the white van was not required.
Hutch was shot dead as he was getting into his car outside Avondale House flats on North Cumberland Street in Dublin on the morning of 24 May, 2016. He died as a result of four gunshot injuries.
Fox (31) with an address at Rutland Court, Dublin 1, Regina Keogh (41) from Avondale House, Cumberland Street North, Dublin 1 and Jonathan Keogh (32) of Gloucester Place, Dublin 1, have pleaded not guilty to murdering Mr Hutch.
Fox has also denied unlawfully possessing a Makarov 9 mm handgun on 23 May, 2016 at the same place.

Evidence
The court heard evidence today of seven out of nine interviews conducted by gardaí with Fox.
Detective Garda Declan O’Brien, of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigations, told prosecuting counsel Diarmaid Collins BL that gardaí arrested Fox on suspicion of murder with a firearm at Mountjoy Garda Station at 7.01pm on 24 May, 2016.
Fox told gardaí he lived with his mother and had a girlfriend of five years who was expecting their baby at the time.
Fox said he was in his aunt’s house on the morning Hutch was killed and she told him about the shooting.
“Being nosey” he cycled down to his girlfriend’s house that morning and they walked to Avondale House “to have a look” but they did not go into the flats.
In the second interview, Fox said he did not have “the stomach or the balls” to pull the trigger of a gun, adding “what kind of thick would hand himself in” to gardaí.
He said it was “not in him” to shoot anyone as his father, Michael Taylor, had been shot in “front of his ma” in 2011 and nothing had been done about it.
“It’s not in me to retaliate,” he said.
The accused said he knew Jonathan Keogh all of his life but the pair had become more friendly in the previous six months after Keogh started training him in the gym. They also did sunbeds together.
Fox’s girlfriend warned him to stay away from Keogh when he told them there was a threat on his life, the court heard.

FIVE PEOPLE HAVE died and an estimated three have been injured after a shooting incident at Capital Gazette newspaper building in Annapolis, Maryland in the US, and police said a suspect was in custody.
Anne Arundel County Police Department spokesman Marc Limansky said officers were searching the building where the shooting was reported.
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said it was responding to reports of the shooting.
Police gave no immediate details on the gunman or the motive for the attack and said the suspect was being interrogated.
Speaking to reporters at a press conference, a police official said: “There are five fatalities that we know of, there are several other persons that are gravely injured.”
Acting chief officer William Krampf said: “The building is secure from a tactical standpoint, that means that right now we believe that there are no other shooters in the building, but it has not been cleared from an investigative standpoint.”
In a later press conference, an officer confirmed that they do not have an identification on the suspect yet, however, they said he is “a white male, adult male”. He said the gun that was used was described as a long gun.
He added that it was estimated that three people had been injured.

A reporter at The Capital Gazette tweeted that a single individual shot multiple people. Phil Davis, who covers business and politics for the newspaper, tweeted that the gunman shot through the glass door to the office and opened fire on multiple employees.
He added: “There is nothing more terrifying than hearing multiple people get shot while you’re under your desk and then hear the gunman reload.”
During the press conference, Krampf said: “Right now we can’t confirm exactly where the shooting occurred throughout that building. The Capital Gazette building is inside that building along with many other businesses and doctors offices.”

On TV reports, people could be seen leaving the building with their hands up, as police officers urged them to depart through a parking lot and officers converged on the building.
A petrol station employee near the shooting scene described a flood of police activity in the area as he sat tight inside his still-open workplace.
In a phone interview, Carlos Wallace, who works just down the street from the newspaper’s offices, estimated that “dozens of dozens” of law enforcement vehicles and ambulances had raced toward the scene with sirens blaring.
“The road is blocked off real good. It’s like dozens of dozens of emergency vehicles, police cars of all types, explosive vehicles, battering ram vehicles, all kinds of stuff,” Wallace said.
US president Donald Trump tweeted this evening and said that he has been brief on the shooting.

What we know
The great Emmet Kirwan and Ian Lloyd Anderson are among the stellar Irish cast here in this film about two brothers who reconnect during a drug-fuelled weekend in Dublin.
What the critics say
“Somewhere between all the yokes, raves and empty cans, Kirwan brings to life the moving tale of family breakdown and the grim truth of addiction. This isn’t an examination of the Dublin drug culture from the outside looking in, it’s one from the inside looking out.” - RTE
“These opening scenes are sharp, zippy, and full of momentum. Although this pace and energy soon prove unsustainable, Tynan continues to show skill and intelligence behind the camera throughout the film. When the narrative meanders, Tynan ensures that the audience is at least looking at something interesting.” - Dublin Inquirer

What we know
A young couple take to the seas for an adventure but find themselves (spoiler!) in danger thanks to a huge hurricane. Based on a true story and starring Shailene Woodley and Sam Claflin as the real-life Tami Oldham and Richard Sharp.
What the critics say
“In a smart structural move, the film switches between two timelines — the couple’s courtship leading up to the storm, and their increasingly desperate-looking attempt to reach land. These moments of romance and laughter as they meet and fall in love alleviating the bleakness of their eventual situation” – Empire
“Woodley gives herself over to the physical and spiritual reality of each scene. She knows how to play an ordinary woman who’s wild at heart, and she keeps you captivated, even when the film itself is watchable in a perfectly competent, touching, and standard way.” – Variety

The sequel to the brilliant Sicario, this sees Benicio del Toro and Josh Brolin playing a hitman and US government agent respectively, who are battling drug cartels. Emily Blunt is gone, and so is Denis Villeneuve, so can this hold up to its predecessor?
What the critics say
“There is something of Kathryn Bigelow in the night-vision scenes, Michael Mann in the large-calibre weaponry and high-speed convoys, and something also of the Coens’ No Country for Old Men, which like this film stars Josh Brolin.” – The Guardian
““Day of the Soldado” gestures toward a few from-the-headlines subjects and accidentally collides with others, but like most Hollywood movies of the moment, it keeps actual politics at a safe distance.” – New York Times

Do I want to be alive?'"",http://www.the42.ie/mikey-drennan-interview-4092752-Jun2018/,"PICTURE THE SCENE: it’s the Dublin Derby at Dalymount Park, Shamrock Rovers against Bohs in April 2016, with an impassioned crowd watching on.
After a promising first half for Bohs, their bitter rivals take the lead in stoppage time of the opening 45 through Gary McCabe.
Brandon Miele adds a second just after the break and a third with 17 minutes remaining. Gavin Brennan puts the icing on the cake with the fourth on 78 minutes.
Mikey Drennan completes 90 minutes of the match. He comes close to scoring after half an hour, but his powerful attempt from distance goes just wide.
Nonetheless, it doesn’t matter. Rovers run riot and secure their biggest league win over Bohs in 52 years.
Understandably, there is elation in the dressing room afterwards. Everyone is on high, seemingly, except for one man. Mikey Drennan steps outside and starts crying. He hasn’t played a League of Ireland match since.
*******
Earlier this month, it was announced that Drennan had signed for Sligo Rovers. He will consequently resume his League of Ireland career two years on from that Rovers-Bohs game.
The move came about after he received a call from Sligo boss Gerard Lyttle. He was effectively given a trial, but an impressive performance saw him offered a contract immediately thereafter.
“There were one or two options, but I think Sligo probably was the best one for me,” Drennan tells The42.
The 24-year-old forward previously considered returning just prior to the 2017 season. Negotiations had begun, but the youngster says he needed to feel 100% sure it was the right time, and so ultimately decided against signing for anyone. Now though, Drennan is certain he can give 100% commitment to his club of choice.
I feel more mature [and can] deal with things better,” he says. “For myself, I think it was the best time to go back. If I didn’t come back now, I don’t think I ever would have. With my head and how I feel, I feel great. Obviously, I need to get a small bit more fit, but that will come with training and in games.”
In Ger Lyttle, Drennan is confident that he has a manager who believes in him and wants the player at the club. Lyttle has spoken of his respect and admiration for how his new signing dealt with past troubles. Drennan says the respect between the pair is mutual, while he is excited about the prospect of representing “a great club” and “a real football town”.
Yet as enthusiastic as Drennan is about joining, he is under no illusions about the scope of the task at hand. Sligo are currently seventh in the Premier Division table, just five points above the relegation places. Drennan is surprised the club are in this perilous position, having witnessed first-hand their most recent performance — an impressive 3-0 win over St Pat’s at Richmond Park the week before last.
There is competition for places in attack. The talented likes of Adam Morgan and Raffaele Cretaro are already on the books at the club.
Drennan recently joined Sligo.
Drennan also acknowledges that there will be sceptics he has to win over. In 2015, still his only full season in the Premier Division, he managed a decent haul of 12 league goals, but a long time has passed since then.
“I still have something to prove and I need to be better than what I was,” he says. “I think now I’m more mature, my attitude is going to be much better. Overall, I think I’m going to be much better. [In my last spell in the League of Ireland] I scored some goals and that’s what I’m going to Sligo for — to score goals.”
The other Sligo players have been welcoming, while he already knows midfielder Rhys McCabe, with both individuals having spent time on loan at Portsmouth in 2014.
With a little under three and a half hours of driving between Sligo and his native Kilkenny, Drennan has unsurprisingly decided to move closer to the club. He will stay in an apartment with one of his new team-mates, Patrick McClean (brother of Ireland international James McClean). His girlfriend is set to join him up there in a couple of weeks. That way, it should feel a little more like home, and less like the difficult situation he found himself in a few years ago in Birmingham.
“That’s basically it,” he says. “I need to keep busy and keep active.”
*******
It was at the age of “around 11 or 12″ while playing for local side Evergreen FC that Drennan first became aware of interest in him from abroad. Both Man City and Aston Villa were reportedly watching intently. He eventually linked up with the latter.
I think I was 14 when I went over and literally every time I went over, bar the last time, I scored,” he recalls. “I think I went over 16 or 17 times, so I think that was a big factor as to why I signed there.”
Drennan impressed both at underage level for Ireland and for Villa’s U18 side. The club’s academy director Bryan Jones spoke of how he “scores goals for fun”. Just after turning 17, he signed his first-ever professional contract with the then-Premier League club. In these same weeks, he was named Ireland U16 Player of the Year at the FAI awards. For a brief moment, Drennan could be forgiven for thinking he had the world at his feet. Unfortunately, his feet — or at least one of them — would become a problem.
*******
Villa were going pretty well at the time too. Under Martin O’Neill, they secured three consecutive sixth-place Premier League finishes. Drennan watched on in admiration as the likes of Richard Dunne, James Milner and Ashley Young impressed as part of one of the best sides in the English top flight.
Despite these awe-inspiring surroundings, nerves, he says, didn’t really come into the equation.
“I didn’t realise how big it was. I was just going over and trying to score goals. I kind of just thought that was ordinary — that’s what I do. When I was at home, I used to score goals. Every time I was going over there, I was scoring goals and it made the decision [to sign for Villa] that bit easier for me.”

Along with Drennan, a number of other promising Irish youngsters, such as Derek Williams and Enda Stevens, were also on the fringes of the first team. Graham Burke, who recently made his international debut and had a superb spell in the League of Ireland at Shamrock Rovers before returning to England with Preston, stayed with him in digs. Drennan is delighted by his friend’s recent success.
“He’s a quality player. I used to love playing with him. Any run you’d make, he’d pick you out,” he remembers.
Drennan was looking as impressive as any of the other youngsters at the time, scoring prolifically for the reserves. Yet a badly timed injury knocked his confidence. A foot problem that initially didn’t seem too serious kept him out of action for almost a year. Off the pitch too, he was struggling, with this setback exacerbating feelings of depression and isolation.
“There were a lot of bad things that a lot of people don’t see. When you go out and play football, you try to forget about what’s going on in your head. You try to forget about everything. It was up until my third year, everything was going well. Then I got the injury. Everything kind of went downhill from there. It wasn’t a good time.
“You’ve got a lot of spare time after training. It’s just boring. As you get older, you start to go out more and you can gamble all the time. You’re just passing so much time and yet you’re just losing all your money, because you never win.
There should be something in place for young lads that are going over like that. Even once or twice a week, just to get them out and have something [to look forward to] — bowling or anything. Just getting them out and active instead of just leaving them in digs.
“[The standard of care] wasn’t good enough when I was there. I don’t know about now, but with the money that the clubs have, it should be much better.”
On the issue of gambling, he continues: “It started off with small money and then it got massive. I wouldn’t gamble now, I’ve stopped. But at the time, I think of the amount of money I could have had and what I could have done with it. You’ve so much time and you just go with it. It might be a tenner and then the tenner will turn into 20s and the 20s to 50s and 50s to 100s. One in about 20 [times] you’ll have a good day and you might win a bit of money. But it’s rare that you win.
“When you’re young and have the money there, you can’t be going out drinking, so you go out buying loads of expensive clothes and all that sort of stuff. And you can’t really afford it at that age, but you still have more than enough money compared to what the average person would be getting.”

After returning from injury, in 2014, Drennan was sent out on loan to Carlisle and later Portsmouth.
“I had just come back from my injury. I was a bit overweight. I would have liked to have played there before the injury, I think I would have done well when I felt sharper — scoring goals and confident. But it’s all ‘ifs’ and ‘buts’. I think when I did play, I wasn’t good enough.”
A year later, the former Ireland underage international left Villa. There were offers elsewhere in England, but by then, Drennan wanted to go home. In January 2015, a move to Shamrock Rovers was confirmed.
One aspect of Drennan’s personality that comes through when speaking to him is that, unlike a number of other footballers, he is certainly not shy when it comes to self-criticism. While he earned praise for his early performances at Rovers, he describes his only full season as a first-team player as “okay,” before adding: “I still should have done much better and scored an extra 12-15 goals.”
In the two years away from the League of Ireland, Drennan’s main focus was to rediscover the pure enjoyment that can be derived from sport. He lined out for local hurling side, James Stephens GAA, and also went back to Evergreen. Last year, he helped guide the Kilkenny team all the way to a first FAI Junior Cup final appearance in 33 years, scoring a crucial goal in their semi-final win over Boyle Celtic, before being part of the side that lost 2-0 to Sheriff YC in the climactic encounter at the Aviva Stadium.
It was going back and playing with my friends I’ve had since I was younger,” he explains. “It made it that bit easier, because it was junior football. It was more relaxing and you can enjoy it and have a few drinks after — the junior way. That’s what everyone does after a game. The camaraderie that you have is good as well.”
Having emerged from the cosseted bubble of youth football in England, Drennan also began to lead a more ordinary life, working in the Three shop in Kilkenny, selling phones, while also attending counselling sessions around this period.
It may not have encompassed the dizzying highs of scoring an exquisite goal or producing a perfect pass in front of a big crowd, but for Drennan, regaining this sense of normality in his life was vital.
“I got more mature. For my head and from my own perspective, my game matured. I was playing centre mid [with Evergreen], I rarely played number nine. I was enjoying my football, getting on the ball and all that stuff.
“The standard is okay and we had a very good team. We won the treble two years in a row — the first team ever to do it in Kilkenny. So it was good that way and it was good to go back and enjoy my football — I think that’s the main thing, I think I will enjoy my football [at Sligo].”

The level of pressure on young footballers has been well documented. Just last week, ex-Hull and Cork City defender Brian Lenihan spoke of how a mental health battle forced his retirement at the age of 23. Drennan, meanwhile, says his only regret is that he didn’t seek help sooner.
“I wasn’t enjoying [football] at all. I just didn’t want to play anymore. I was literally contemplating: ‘Do I want to be here anymore? Do I want to be alive anymore?’
“Things like that, what I did — it did help me when I got the help that I needed to look after myself. And it helped other people as well, just from seeing my own story, which was great.”
The young forward knows the depression will always be there to an extent, but now feels better equipped to deal with any issues. The interview concludes with Drennan offering invaluable advice to anyone who is struggling.
Literally just talk. Talk to anyone. Talk to someone who you trust. That’s a massive thing. Even if it’s someone in the club, if it’s a friend, if it’s a coach, anything. If you’re struggling, just talk. Even if it’s just for two minutes, it will make you feel that little bit better.”

1230,193,"Two more bishops resign in Chile over child sex abuse scandal",https://www.thejournal.ie/chilean-bishops-4098081-Jun2018/,"POPE FRANCIS ACCEPTED the resignation of two more Chilean bishops following a child sex abuse scandal that has gripped the Latin American nation.
The Vatican announced the resignation of the bishop of Rancagua, 78-year-old Alejandro Goic Karmelic and the bishop of Talca, Horacio del Carmen Valenzuela Abarca, 64.
Several senior members of Chile’s Catholic Church are accused by victims of ignoring and covering up child abuse by paedophile priest Fernando Karadima during the 1980s and 1990s.
Goic offered his resignation three years ago due to his age, but the Pope did not accept it. His departure comes amid a sexual abuse scandal in his own diocese, where 14 priests have been suspended.
Those crimes were allegedly committed by a network called “The Family” over the course of at least a decade, before a member of the parish denounced them last week in a television report. A criminal investigation is underway.
Carmen Valenzuela, meanwhile, was a follower of Karadima, who was suspended for life by the Vatican. He was named by Karadima’s victims as a figure who ignored or covered up the abuse.
Several victims welcomed the news of their resignations.
“Slowly but surely… two less wicked and corrupt bishops”, Juan Carlos Cruz, now a communications executive, wrote on Twitter.
The entire Chilean delegation of bishops tendered its resignation to the pope in May after a series of meetings at the Vatican.

Earlier this month, Francis accepted the resignation of three Chilean bishops, including the controversial Juan Barros who Karadima’s victims accuse of covering up wrongdoing.
The pontiff himself became mired in the scandal when, during a trip to Chile in January, he defended Barros. However the pope later apologised to Karadima’s victims and said he had made “grave mistakes”.

1231,286,"Protected disclosure made by David Taylor 'essentially a work of fiction', lawyers for gardaí tell Tribunal",https://www.thejournal.ie/disclosures-tribunal-submissions-4097295-Jun2018/,"Updated Jun 28th 2018, 6:50 PM
THE PROTECTED DISCLOSURE made by former garda press officer Superintendent David Taylor “is essentially a work of fiction”, lawyers for An Garda Síochana have told the Disclosures Tribunal.
Shane Murphy SC was speaking during his closing submission to the tribunal, which is examining allegations from Taylor that he was directed to brief negatively against garda whistleblower Sergeant Maurice McCabe.
Former commissioner Martin Callinan denies giving any such direction, and his then deputy Nóirín O’Sullivan denies she was aware of such a direction.
“There is no substantiated evidence that Mr Callinan or Ms O’Sullivan instructed or directed any such effort on Superintendent Taylor’s part to malign Sergeant McCabe, or that either were aware of any such effort,” Murphy told Justice Peter Charlton, the tribunal chairman.
Murphy said that Superintendent Taylor’s 2016 protected disclosure was “essentially a work of fiction”, and the chairman should find that the allegations that Superintendent Taylor was directed to negatively brief against Sergeant McCabe were untrue.
“We say that such a finding, if made, will serve the public interest in establishing how a mere allegation can become the received truth at enormous cost to the individuals involved and at enormous cost to our society,” Murphy said.
“It will also serve the public interest in at least partially addressing the substantial harm to the reputation and professional standing of former commissioner Callinan and former commissioner O’Sullivan,” Murphy said.
Murphy said that the tribunal had shown the ease with which allegations of misconduct could gain public traction, but a different picture emerged when they were tested in evidence under oath.
“What has emerged from the evidence is a very different picture to what was contained in the allegations in the protected disclosure,” Murphy said.
Murphy said that Superintendent Taylor’s credibility was “effectively shattered”.
Counsel said that the existence of a rumour in 2014 did not of itself ground an inference that it must have been spread in a deliberate way by Superintendent Taylor, and some journalists said they heard rumours as early as 2011 before Superintendent Taylor became press officer.
Murphy said that Superintendent Taylor was upset, angry and bitter at being moved from his role in the garda press office.
‘Unworthy of trust’
Meanwhile, a barrister representing RTÉ told the Disclosures Tribunal that Superintendent Taylor’s account of his dealings with journalists was “unworthy of trust”.
Journalists John Burke and Paul Reynolds had reputations built up over decades, and there was “simply no evidence to support adverse findings against them”, Sean Gillane SC said on behalf of RTÉ.
Both journalists deny allegations made by Taylor that he negatively briefed them about McCabe.
Gillane said nobody had pointed to a syllable of Burke’s journalism to suggest he was party to any alleged smear campaign of McCabe, and reports by Reynolds about McCabe were “a textbook example of journalism at work”.
Gillane said that email records showed that there were extensive editorial discussions before broadcast about the contents of news reports Reynolds made on a leaked copy of the findings of the O’Higgins Commission of investigation.
The O’Higgins Commission looked at complaints made by McCabe about policing in the Cavan-Monaghan district. Gillane submitted that there was no evidence of any external interference or briefings in relation to the reports from Garda HQ.
Gillane also said there was no reason why journalist Philip Boucher-Hayes would make up an encounter with former commissioner Martin Callinan. The journalist said that before a Crimeline programme in December 2013, Callinan told him McCabe had done “the worst kind of things”.
Counsel said that Boucher-Hayes had volunteered his evidence after the chairman called on anyone with information to come forward, and had reported to colleagues what Callinan had told him shortly after the event occurred.
Pattern of behaviour
Earlier, Darren Lehane BL said that the meeting between Boucher Hayes and Callinan was relevant to his client, John McGuinness TD, as it showed a pattern of behaviour.
Lehane said the tribunal chairman was entitled to consider the evidence of other witnesses about encounters they had with Callinan on 24 January 2014. In particular, Lehane referred to a brief meeting between Callinan and comptroller and auditor general Seamus McCarthy.
McGuinness told the tribunal that on 23 January 2014 after a Public Accounts Committee (PAC) meeting, Callinan told him McCabe “fiddles with kids”.
McGuinness said that at a meeting in a Dublin hotel car park the following day, Callinan also said that there were investigations into abuse allegations against McCabe.

Lehane said that the fact that similar remarks were reported by Seamus McCarthy, the comptroller and auditor general, showed a pattern of behaviour by Callinan.
Callinan was “desperate” to stop McCabe before appearing at the PAC, Lehane said. He submitted his client, McGuinness’s, evidence was supported by a near-contemporaneous note he made after the meeting, and by similar accounts of meetings given by other witnesses.
The barrister said that Callinan’s claims that two witnesses would raise the same issue in an identical manner, that he would would respond in a near identical manner, and never make a record of those “unusual” conversations anywhere were not credible.
Lehane said his other client, journalist Ann Harris, was subjected to attacks on her character and threatened with defamation proceedings and suggestions she was motivated by bitterness or a grudge.
Michael O’Higgins SC, on behalf of David Taylor, said that of 12 journalists his client had nominated who would support his evidence, 10had “confirmed in stark terms they did not receive any such briefings, and two of the journalists weren’t willing to comment”.
Taylor claims that he was directed to negatively brief journalists about McCabe by Commissioner Callinan, and that his deputy Nóirín O’Sullivan was aware of the direction. Both former commissioners deny the allegations.
O’Higgins said that it was either “an incredible coincidence” or there was something to Taylor’s evidence, as it matched closely the evidence of other witnesses about what they alleged Callinan said to them.
“If he was a fantasist who just wanted to throw a spanner in the works, he was a very fortunate fantasist and he was a very lucky spanner thrower,” O’Higgins said.
O’Higgins said that the tribunal could conclude that Taylor and Callinan “were working in tandem, rather than separately and in ignorance of each other”.
He said that Taylor did “bear an animus” to O’Sullivan, and had incorrectly believed she was a driving force behind his arrest and attempts to discredit him during an investigation into garda leaks.
O’Higgins said that Taylor’s evidence was capable of being believed, and it was up to the chairman to decide if it should be believed.

1232,287,"Homeless man who brandished toy gun on Dart given 12-month suspended sentence",https://www.thejournal.ie/homeless-man-toy-gun-jailed-4097799-Jun2018/,"A HOMELESS MAN who brandished a toy gun on the Dart and frightened an American passenger has been given a 12-month suspended sentence at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court.
Mark Byrne (39) was “under the influence and giggling” when he waved the air pistol out the Dart window on a summer’s afternoon last year, the court heard.
The father-of-one, with an address at a homeless unit on Newtown Avenue, Blackrock, Co Dublin, pleaded guilty to possessing a realistic imitation firearm at Connolly Station on 10 July 2017.
When asked by gardaí why he had bought the gun, Byrne said he got it to shoot out the back of streetcars, adding that he lived at a homeless shelter and “didn’t have much of a life”.
Passing sentence today, Judge Karen O’Connor said Byrne had displayed “an extraordinary degree of immaturity” but had not intended to harm anyone.
“I accept that he’s extremely sorry and has learnt his lesson,” she said, agreeing that the offence was “at the lower range” of seriousness.
Witnesses
Garda Siobhán Frisby told Marie Torrens BL, prosecuting, that there were three witnesses sitting across from Byrne on the light rail carriage, one of whom was an American woman travelling to Bray with her husband.
Grace Malone told gardaí that she spotted a man picking up orange pellets from the floor and wondered “what the hell” he was doing.
The man appeared to be under the influence and shooting at someone, she said, although she didn’t know at whom he was aiming.
She said the man shot out the window and said: “Go on, ya gobshite!”
Malone said she was in fear that the man was going to shoot at her, but her husband knew straight away that it was an imitation firearm.
Arrest
Garda Frisby saw Byrne waving the handgun out the window of the carriage and giggling before he was arrested by gardaí.
The pistol was analysed by Garda ballistics experts and found to be a realistic imitation firearm branded an “airgun”.
Byrne’s backpack also contained about 1,000 Chinese-made 6mm calibre plastic pellets.
Byrne told gardaí he’d bought the gun after he saw it in the window of a toy shop on Talbot Street.
He said it was supposed to cost €8, but he got the gun and a thousand pellets for €10.
“I don’t have much of a life, living in a homeless shelter,” he said.
Previous convictions

Byrne has 69 previous convictions, the vast majority of which were for public order offences in the District Court.
Garda Frisby agreed with Anne-Marie Lawlor SC, defending, that Byrne was extremely naive and cut somewhat of a “pitiful” figure.
The garda further agreed with Lawlor that the gun was something “a young fella might play with” and could be bought by anyone in a toy shop.
Lawlor said her client did not have any realisation of how his actions might have been perceived by others and was very unlikely to engage in this type of behaviour again.
The court heard that most of Byrne’s history of offending stemmed from his addiction issues but that he had not been in trouble since this offence.
Byrne has a health complaint which requires ongoing medical supervision, his counsel said.
Judge O’Connor warned Byrne that if he breached his bail conditions there would be serious consequences, to which he replied that he understood.
Leaving the court, Byrne said to the judge, “Cheers, thanks a million. Sorry for wasting the court’s time and the police’s time.”","The man pleaded guilty to possessing a realistic imitation firearm at Connolly Station on 10 July 2017.",2,0,0,11885,"Jun 28th 2018, 6:11 PM"
1233,292,"15 legal abortions were carried out in Ireland last year",https://www.thejournal.ie/abortion-ireland-6-4097790-Jun2018/,"A TOTAL OF 15 legally-permitted abortions were carried out in Ireland last year under the provisions of Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.
The Act was made law in 2013, and was commenced in January 2014. Under its terms, abortion is still illegal in Ireland except in extremely limited circumstances.
There are just three circumstances which relate to risks to the life of the mother in which abortion is not strictly prohibited.
These are:
When there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman arising from a physical illness
When there is an immediate risk to the life of the woman arising from a physical illness
And when there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman arising from suicide intent
The fourth annual report on the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act was handed to the Houses of the Oireachtas today as required under Section 20 of the Act.
It showed that last year 15 legal terminations were carried out under the above conditions.
A total of eight were carried out due to a real risk from a physical illness; five were carried out due to an emergency from a physical illness; and two were carried out due to the risk of suicide.
This is a drop from 25 legally-permitted abortions being carried out last year.  
Last month, Irish people voted overwhelmingly to repeal the Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution, which grants the equal right to life to the mother and the unborn child.
The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act remains the primary legislation on abortion until such a time as the Eighth is repealed and legislation is passed through the Oireachtas, which would legalise abortion in many cases.

THE IRISH AIR Corps has been called in as fire crews in Co Wicklow have been working to protect homes after a number of fires have broken out in the county.
Conditions have showed no sign of cooling off today, as top temperatures across the country have ranged between 26 and 30 degrees, according to Met Éireann.
An official request came into the Defence Forces for assistance in dealing with gorse fires in Lower Lough Bray and Liffey Head Bog this evening.
Meanwhile, Wicklow Fire Service tweeted today that its Bray and Greystones crews were working to protect a school and houses in Kilmacanogue.

Speaking to TheJournal.ie, local independent councillor Christopher Fox confirmed that a decision was made at around 1pm this afternoon to move children from a school in Kilmacanogue to its sports pitches due to fires nearby.
Fox said that the school is located next to scrub land and mountain land.
He said that there had been numerous fires on that land over the past few days.
However, he said: “Today, it had got very close to some houses and the school, obviously. It had been contained more on the mountain in previous days.”

Elsewhere, Dublin Fire Brigade has been battling a number of gorse fires around the county today.
A forest fire has broken out at the Lugg and Slade Valley mountain area.
A spokesperson for Dublin Fire Brigade said that a number of resources have been tackling the fire throughout the day and that they received assistance from the Irish Air Corps earlier today.

The spokesperson said there had been a number of small fires in the area since Saturday and that there are now forest areas and trees on fire.
He added that while it is a relatively rural area, there are some houses in the local vicinity which officers are monitoring to determine whether they need to be evacuated.
He appealed to the public not to travel to areas where there are gorse fires to look at them.
“Even if people are going to recreational areas, leave gateways clear in case we need to access them,” he said.

Senior management appeared before the Policing Authority this afternoon at Dublin Castle, where they were asked in particular about the €12.4 million overtime overspend.
Joe Nugent, the chief administration officer for An Garda Síochána said overtime is the “biggest issue of discretionary spending” and it is the subject of many senior management meetings.
“A third of the overtime spend relates to an agreement, a pay agreement reached, the next another roughly 20% relates to attendance at court so that’s bringing us very quickly into a difficult space to make available overtime for what it’s really needed for,” he explained.
He said a series of decisions had been made as a result, including a cap on the amount of overtime a garda can work in their four-week roster cycle and a more robust authorisation process. He said he is not certain the organisation can pay wages for the year within the current budget.
In terms of pay, if we put aside the overtime piece, I see that being difficult if not impossible. I don’t believe that the funding for the salary subhead provided for the expectations set on us in terms of recruitment targets and the spend that we are seeing merely reflects the recruitment that we are committed to achieving. So I would be uncertain that we would be in a position to deliver the pure salaries component of our vote within the allocation that’s made.
He said the issue has been raised with the Department of Justice “for some time” and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is also now involved.
There is an expectation and a public want to see more civilians in the organisation and a want to see more gardaí in the organisation and we are seeking to progress that issue, but that brings a charge and brings a cost as I said I see huge challenges in us being able to deliver the salaries component within budget by end year.
During the meeting, the organisation’s director of human resources John Barrett also explained the difficulties with providing vital training within the current budget.
The budget for discretionary training provides for €140 per head for the entire organisation.
“That is so grossly inadequate,” he told members of the authority.

The 15.35 Heuston to Galway train collided with 8 cattle at a level crossing near Tullamore in the past hour.

Speaking this evening on RTÉ’s Drivetime, Irish Rail spokesperson Jane Cregan said that the cattle may have gotten onto the tracks via the level crossing
“There’s a level crossing in that area, we believe that that’s how they got onto the line. But again we’re investigating that so we don’t have exact confirmation of how that happened at present,” she said.
Cregan said that as a result of the collision there was “very significant damage to the train”.
A relief train arrived and the passengers were removed from the train and reboarded. Passengers were delayed by about three hours in total. While they waited, crew brought extra bottled water for them to drink in the heat.

A 1-0 defeat to Colombia on Thursday afternoon saw them finish third in Group H.
But the result might have been enough to see them into the knockout stages, were it not for their disciplinary record.
Senegal finished on four points after beating Poland 2-1 and drawing 2-2 with Japan, while also finishing on the same goal difference as Akira Nishino’s side.
Senegal scored four goals and conceded four in their three group games (the exact same as Japan) but exit the competition after racking up two more bookings than their Group H counterparts.
Jan Bednarek’s strike at the Vogograd Arena saw Japan fall 1-0 to Poland on Thursday, but despite the defeat they progress to the last sixteen — where they will face either England or Belgium.
Progression to the knockout stages is determined firstly by points total, then goal difference, then head-to-head — with the final determining factor being the disciplinary record of both teams.
Senegal’s group stage exit is the first time in World Cup history a team has been knocked out of the tournament on account of Fifa’s Fair Play points.

IRISH WATER WILL tonight begin lowering water pressure levels in the Greater Dublin Area as demand for water has increased again in the past 24 hours as a result of the high temperatures.
Irish Water, working with local authorities, is lowering nighttime water pressure levels in the Greater Dublin Area to the minimum level. The utility said it will not impact businesses but will assist in managing demand more effectively.
Eamon Gallen, General Manager of Irish Water told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland this morning that it is “operating on a knife edge”.
In the Greater Dublin Area, Irish Water said it can sustainably and safely produce 610 million litres of water supplies and demand around the country.
However, in the past 24 hours, demand reached 615 megalitres. Irish Water said this level of demand meant drawing from treated water storage to maintain full supply. This option can only be maintained for a limited period of a few weeks, it said.
In a statement today, it said: “Irish Water’s priority is to minimise the impact on homes and businesses, particularly during this period of holidays and high tourism.”
Speaking on Morning Ireland, Gallen said Dublin’s water supply is “not resilient to stand up” to hot weather.

Demand on water supply is increasing and there is less water available for treatment, said Gallen, who urged people to conserve water where possible.
People should take shorter showers, avoid watering their lawn, and they should not wash their cars during the dry spell.
Other water restrictions
Irish Water said it is “very concerned” about the possibility of having to impose restrictions in the long term.
“This will become unavoidable if the dry conditions persist into the autumn with lower than normal rainfalls,” it said.
Currently, there are other water restrictions in place in a number of areas around the country.
Customers in Kilkenny, Longford, Athlone, north Galway, Louth, and Kerry have already experienced restricted water supply and outages in some cases. Currently, almost 4,000 customers are impacted.
Some areas in Cork, Wicklow, Limerick, Kilkenny, Carlow, Tipperary, Clare, Mayo, Sligo, Donegal, Galway, Roscommon, Laois, Limerick, Kerry, Waterford and Offaly have been identified as being at risk.
Speaking in the Dáil this week, Fine Gael’s Alan Farrell said the public have to be responsible and cut-back on their water usage at times when there are shortages, adding that he was surprised when he got a text message from a constituent to tell him there was a queue for the car wash at a service station in north County Dublin affected by the water shortage.
Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government John Paul Phelan said there was a need to promote water conservation, adding that the suggestion of a hosepipe ban is one possible measure.
Hosepipe ban
Irish Water has the power to introduce a hosepipe ban and restrict the use of commercial car washes under current legislation, according to the minister.
Alan Farrell raised the issue of the pressure on Ireland’s water supply during this week’s hot weather, stating that restrictions under the Water Services Act 2007 should be implemented.
Speaking in the Dáil yesterday, Farrell said it is appropriate to look at the implementation of hosepipe bans, administered either through Irish Water or through the local authorities.
“This is a serious issue that will need to be addressed until such time as the capital and, indeed, other parts of the country have a water supply capable of withstanding more than a few days of sunshine. Today is a beautiful day. The temperature is in the high twenties in Dublin. I am sure it is higher elsewhere in the country,” he said.
He added:
There are six locations in the State that are without water at the moment, including one location in my own constituency, another in County Longford, and other places.
Replying to Dublin North TD, the minister said Irish Water is prepared to use section 56 of the 2007 legislation.
“It has the capability under law to act when it finds treated water is at an unacceptably low-level,” he said.

Phelan said that under the Water Services Act 2007 there are already statutory provisions for the introduction of a such a ban and other restrictions designed to conserve water supplies during times of drought.
It also provides for a fine of €125 for breach of such restrictions.
These arrangements can come into force when a water services authority – which effectively means Irish Water – is of the opinion that a serious shortage of water supplies exists or is imminent in an area, he explained.
This would typically be during or following a prolonged period of dry weather but, in any event, it is possible for Irish Water to make such an order where demand is expected to exceed supply and it becomes necessary to restrict the use of water supplies including restricting certain activities involving the use of water.
The minister said that specified activities which may be restricted include watering a garden, watering of recreational parks or sports grounds, irrigating or spraying crops, washing vehicles, the provision of commercial washing services for a vehicle or trailer, or filling or replenishing a swimming pool or an artificial pond or lake.
In practice, the restrictions may apply to specified activities for all or specified parts of the day.
Making an order 
Before making an order the water services authority must give public notice of its intention to make such order and the period for which the order will remain in force through advertising in the public press or broadcast announcements on television or local or national radio, said Phelan.
The minister said such provisions are well established in other European and international jurisdictions.
“While the option of a hosepipe ban is there, we need to look to other conservation measures and the management of our water supplies. Irish Water’s drought management group has been meeting to assess the risk to drinking water supplies,” said Phelan.
The minister said Irish Water has advised him that current storage in the raw water reservoirs in the greater Dublin area, at Roundwood and Pollaphuca, are reasonable and they do not see water shortages at present.
However, if the summer and autumn continue dry and hot, these reservoirs will come under pressure later in the year.
“It behoves all authorities of the State, in addition to citizens, to recognise that their use of water will have a direct impact on their neighbours and communities if they do not act responsibly. Most people recognise that in times of scarcity, such as this, it is up to them to be responsible in their use of water,” concluded the minister.","Irish Water has asked the public to conserve water where possible during the hot weather.",619,0,0,35724,"Jun 28th 2018, 12:17 PM"

It is also likely that the travelling support could outnumber the Kildare spectators at the game, given the bigger number of season ticket holders in Mayo.
The Leinster side are hosting the game on Saturday following a highly publicised stand-off with the GAA, who originally fixed the game for Croke Park as part of double-header with Cavan and Tyrone, despite Kildare being drawn first on Monday morning.
The GAA has since announced that the game will now be staged in St Conleth’s Park, Newbridge following discussions with the Kildare County Committee and An Garda Síochána in recent days.
Kildare GAA published a statement on Wednesday night thanking the GAA’s Central Competitions Control Committee (CCCC) for its support in bringing the match back to Nebridge, and has since released a separate statement which reads:
“Coiste Chontae Chill Dara would like to place on record our heartfelt thanks to the clubs and followers of Kildare GAA, who have been so supportive not just this week but through all good times and bad.
“That is something that we have never taken for granted.
It is a source of great regret therefore that we will not be able to accommodate the huge demand for tickets among the Kildare GAA public for this game, and thank you for your understanding and patience in this regard.
“We would ask people who do not have a ticket for the match on Saturday not to turn up in Newbridge.
“We reiterate our appreciation of the support for Kildare GAA.
St Conleth’s Park has a capacity of 8,200 and Kildare and Mayo County Committees will receive ’1,500 tickets each for club distribution,’ according to a statement from the GAA.
“The remainder will be used to meet the needs of players, season ticket holders and sponsors.”
Mayo have approximately 3,500 season ticket holders while Kildare have roughly 1,000 season ticket holders, meaning that it is likely that the visiting supporters will outnumber the Kildare spectators in the Newbridge venue.
Additionally, Mayo released a statement earlier this week in which they expressed a desire ‘that all Mayo GAA season ticket holders will get access to a ticket for this game.’
Director of communications Alan Milton told RTÉ Sport on Wednesday that the original decision to move the game to Croke Park was motivated by concerns about the ‘health and safety of patrons.’

Emergency accommodation figures for May show that there are now collectively 9,846 homeless people living in homeless shelters or hotels across Ireland.
The number of homeless adults rose by 57 in May to 6,020. These 57 adults were all located in Dublin.
There was also an increase of 12 families and 137 children in May. The number of homeless children in Ireland is now 3,826.
In Dublin – where the issue is by far at its worst – the number of homeless families dropped by 14, but the number of children rose by 76.
No families were removed from the figures over the so-called “categorisation issue”, which has resulted in to date about 900 adults and children being removed from the monthly count.
Housing Minister Eoghan Murphy has said that the families in these situations were in “homes”. This is despite criticism levelled at the Department by opposition TDs as well as charity officials over the removal of families from the monthly figures.
Dublin City Council assistant chief executive Brendan Kenny has also said that these families were “still homeless”, despite being removed from the figures.
“Stabilisation” 
Commenting on the figures, Minister Murphy said that any increase in people in emergency accommodation is “very disappointing”, but said that the figures pointed to a continuation of the “stabilisation” that had been seen in recent months.
“Family homelessness has always been more of a pronounced problem in Dublin than in the rest of the country, so it is encouraging that the numbers of families accessing emergency accommodation in May fell,” he said.

Sikora said that it was immediately apparent to the curator on duty what they were as they have similar objects in the national collection of Bronze Age gold at the NMI.

According to Sikora a lot of the Bronze Age artefacts in the museum are older finds, found when context was not so well recorded.
She said that it was important for them to understand the circumstances under which these objects were buried in the ground at the time.
“We have investigated the site and now our research will start.
“They are tubes of gold about the size of an arm ring, so they were probably worn and probably someone’s portable wealth.”
The NMI say that a lot of bronze age metalworks are often deposited in watery places like rivers and lakes so it’s not unusual that the gold hoard was found in the wet location in Donegal.
The location of the find will not be revealed so that ‘”treasure hunters” are not attracted to the area.
The NMI is grateful to the people who called in the find but there will be no finders’ fee as objects found without a known owner are automatically state property.
Sikora told Morning Ireland that the find is for everyone to enjoy as part of the national collection and will be on display in the NMI once their research is complete.","The exact location of the find will not be revealed so treasure hunters are not attracted to the area.",122,0,2,26071,"Jun 28th 2018, 3:35 PM"

IT’S BEEN 30 years since the first Galway Film Fleadh took place – and its managing director Miriam Allen has watched it go from a volunteer-led event showing archive films to one that’s spotlighting future Oscar nominees.
She’s been doing the job for 30 years. “When we started the fleadh, for the first couple of years we were showing films from the Irish Film Archive, Irish films, because there was no film industry,” she says, recounting how different things were back then.
It was a time before Jim Sheridan at the Oscars, before Saoirse Ronan’s meteoric rise, and before Hollywood knew just what Irish film could do.
It was, as the festival itself says:
…borne out of a sense of frustration at the lack of opportunity for Irish filmmakers to exhibit their work to their peers
“There were [directors] Bob Quinn, Joe Comerford, Cathal Black – they were making a film every two or three years or so. There was no industry, so the fleadh in a way reflects the growth in the Irish film industry,” says Allen.
We started with those three filmmakers, the forerunners, a cottage industry, and suddenly we have this. The film industry is booming in Ireland – so the fleadh reflects that.
Running the fleadh “was an uphill battle at the beginning”, admits Allen, but a look at what’s already been been announced for this year’s event shows how important it is. Already pencilled in are Ross Whitaker’s documentary on Katie Taylor, and Pat Shortt’s new film The Belly of the Whale (the full programme will be announced tonight).
Source: Galway Film Fleadh/Twitter
It’s been a long journey for the fleadh. “When we first started, there were two cinemas in Galway – the Claddagh Palás and Town Hall. All they were showing was American movies, that was the diet of cinema,” says Allen.
When the fleadh started and we were bringing Italian cinema, Spanish cinema, that’s when we discovered there is an appetite: people want to see independent filmmaking outside the American studio system.
It probably doesn’t comes as a surprise to hear that the fleadh wasn’t set up to be a money-making exercise. “For the first seven years, everyone who worked on it, we were all volunteering – every single one of us,” says Allen. Once they had “proved themselves”, they started getting funding.
“After being around that long the Arts Council started giving us the few bob – [and] whoever else and wherever we could get it,” says Allen. Today, it has between 10 and 12 key staff members who help make the whole operation work.
The festival was always a labour of love (Allen famously told the Irish Times that she gave birth to one of her children during the 1995 festival, and drove herself to the hospital while in labour), and Allen is hugely enthusiastic about what this year’s event promises us. She knows, too, how important an event it is for those in the Irish film industry.

‘These filmmakers have grown up together’
“The entire Irish film industry decamps from Dublin to Galway to the week of the fleadh,” she says. “There’s no doubt about that.”
When the festival first started, it used to show archive films, then began to screen shorts made by Irish film students. Allen’s seen young filmmakers like Lenny Abrahamson cut their teeth on short films before going on to be Oscar nominated. Damien O’Donnell, director of East is East, won an award for a short at the fleadh; Kirsten Sheridan (Disco Pigs director) showed her first film at the event.
“All of those filmmakers, we’ve all grown up together,” says Allen. The fact that so much Irish talent is on show also means that people from across the world flock there to see what the Emerald Isle offers on screen. “It puts Irish film on the international stage,” says Allen. Films have been shown at the Fleadh that ended up in Sundance, while guests have included Sir Richard Attenborough, Peter O’Toole and Pierce Brosnan
To help mark the 30 year celebrations, she’s been delving through archive material. Among the ephemera, she discovered a registration page filled out in 1989 by James Hickey, who went on to become the CEO of the Irish Film Board.
“He has been coming for 30 years… People like that, it’s kind of extraordinary,” says Allen.
Can the Irish film industry be too focused on Dublin? “It can be definitely [Dublin centric],” says Allen. “Listen, we just keep asking until you get a yes. I never take no for an answer. You have to keep going back, back, back until they say yes.”
‘When I started going to other festivals, they were all run by men’
Allen is particularly happy to see the latest discussions around getting more women into the film industry, such as the Irish Film Board’s new gender policy and funding for women-led projects.
“I think it’s very important and I’m really delighted,” she says. “Annie Doona, Chair of Irish Film Board, she has made it a priority and it’s fantastic.”
But it’s still hard for a festival like the Galway Film Fleadh to have gender parity, which is something Allen is hoping will change in the future as more women are encouraged to make movies.
As a leading woman in Ireland’s film scene, she’s also someone who’s seen first-hand how females are treated by some film buffs. “Listen, totally, they’re still at that,” she says when asked if she has experienced any sexist behaviour. “You can see it a mile off. I just keep talking. It has got better, I mean it’s like a slow awakening really isn’t it, and people are finally as I would say: ‘[waking] up and smell[ing] the coffee’.”
She says the industry is now “slowly changing”, and it’s something she’s very happy about. There are lots of women on the fleadh organising team, for example.
When I started going to other festivals, first they were all run by men, it was amazing – and that, I even notice, is beginning to change.
As well as showing films, the festival has pre-scheduled over 600 meetings between filmmakers and producers and financiers. There are also masterclasses with people like actor Andrew Scott. When it comes to both encouraging Irish filmmakers of all stripes, and ensuring there’s room for women to get into the industry, Galway Film Fleadh is showing it can lend a helping hand.
“It’s films morning, noon and night,” says Allen of what we can expect from this year’s festival. “And something for absolutely everybody.”

Mr Justice David Barniville was told by Fintan Valentine BL for the Board that the planning authority was now prepared to concede to an order quashing the planning permission.
Earlier this year the board gave Crekav Trading, part of developer Marlet, the go-ahead to build 104 houses and 432 apartments on lands used by St Paul’s College, in Raheny as six playing pitches.
That decision has been challenged, in separate actions, brought by parties including Clonres CLG, which represents residents from the Clontarf area, environmental campaigner Peter Sweetman and Mr John Conway and the Louth Environmental Group.
They want the decision quashed on grounds including that the decision is fundamentally flawed.
They each seek various orders including one quashing An Bord Pleanala’s decision to grant planning permission.
They also seek various declarations including that the board failed to undertake or an Appropriate Assessment on the conservation of natural habitats of wild flora and fauna, and failed to comply with the EU Birds Directive.
As well as the board proceedings have also been brought against, Ireland and the Attorney General and the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in respect of the decision.
The developers are notice parties.
Mention
The case was briefly mentioned before Mr Justice Barniville today, who was informed by Mr Valentine that the board accepted it had made an error regarding the manner it had recorded an Appropriate Assessment conducted on the site as is required under the EU Habitats Directive.
As a result, counsel said the Board is prepared to consent to orders quashing the planning decision.

The Judge adjourned to matter to a date next month to allow the parties, and notice parties which include the developer, consider what the board has said.
The case has been brought on grounds including that an Appropriate Assessment on the possible adverse effects the development will have on the site was not properly carried out.
The site, it is claimed is a significant foraging ground for the internationally important population of east Canadian high Arctic light-bellied Brent geese, and other protected species curlew, black-tailed godwit, black-headed gull and oystercatcher.
The lands the subject of the proceedings was formally owned by the Vincentian Fathers, who are the trustees of the all-boys secondary school St Paul’s College. Local sports club have also used the pitches.

1246,180,"Five officials sought 'cooling-off period' waivers before taking up lobbying jobs",https://www.thejournal.ie/sipo-lobbying-4096689-Jun2018/,"FIVE WORKERS WHO worked in government departments, as civil servants and as ministerial special advisers sought to have their ‘cooling-off’ period either reduced or waived last year, according to the Standards in Public Office Commission’s (Sipo) annual report.
The purpose of a ‘cooling-off’ period is generally to prevent the use of insider information and ensure that a person does not gain unfair advantage in terms of their knowledge and connections in their new job.
In four of the five cases, the commission granted waivers. In the fifth case, permission for a reduction or waiver of the period was refused.
Under the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015, those involved in lobbying the government must sign-up to a register in order to facilitate transparency in the system.
The commission oversees the register in which individuals, organisations, companies and PR agencies must file returns to about their lobbying activities each year.
‘Cooling-off period’ 
Section 22 of the Act provides that ministers, ministers of state, special advisers and senior public officials are subject to a one-year “cooling-off” period before they engage in lobbying activities in a new job.
However, a person subject to the cooling-off period may apply to the commission for a reduction or waiver in the time period.
Last year, one senior civil servant, three special advisers, and one department official applied to have the cooling-off period waived.
One special adviser sought to waive the final ten months of the cooling-off period before taking up employment with two separate organisations.
The person had been a special adviser in a government department, and both organisations the employee would be working for had carried out lobbying activities with the person’s former department.
In the case of one of the organisations, it had recently communicated directly with the applicant.
‘Not in the public interest’
The commission considered that to consent to the application for a waiver would not be in keeping with the objectives set out by the Act and would not be in the public interest.
It also took into account that the person was seeking to take up employment within a very short period of having ceased to be an adviser and with an organisation that had recently and directly lobbied the person and the department with which they were connected.
Moreover, the person had been offered the position without a competitive process, stated the annual report.
The special adviser’s application was refused, and later appealed. The appeal officer upheld the commission’s decision.
New job in consultancy services
One civil servant, who was seeking to provide consultancy services to a company on the register that had previously carried out lobbying activities with that department, had six months reduced from the cooling-off period.
The report states that the applicant, and the company the applicant was seeking to provide services to, had each confirmed that he or she would not be expected to participate in or advise on any prohibited lobbying activities during the relevant period.

SUPPORT US NOW
A department official who sought a ten-month waiver was also successful in their application, and had it granted under similar circumstances.
Another special adviser who worked in two government departments sought to have nine months removed from the cooling-off period, while another special adviser sought a ten-month reduction.
The commission took into account that the company in which both applicants were seeking to take up employment had not previously carried out lobbying activities with the applicants or with either of the departments they worked for. The waivers were granted.
Lobbying activities 
In 2017, the commission issued 198 notices to people informing them of its intent to prosecute if the person did not submit a return of lobbying activities.
While prosecution proceedings were initiated in six cases, compliance was achieved in all cases and there were no convictions during 2017 for failure to submit a return of lobbying activities.
It total, almost 10,000 returns of lobbying activities were submitted. Health continued to be the policy area most lobbied about, followed by economic development and industry, agriculture, justice and equality, and housing.
Sipo now plans to develop a code of conduct for lobbying, which is due to be completed by the end of 2018.","The purpose of a ‘cooling-off’ period is to prevent the use of insider information.",17,0,0,12128,"Jun 28th 2018, 2:03 PM"

A LONG-AWAITED summit between US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin will take place in Helsinki on 16 July, the Kremlin and the White House said in simultaneous statements this afternoon.
“An agreement has been reached that on 16 July in Helsinki there will be a meeting between the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin and the President of the United States Donald Trump,” the Kremlin said.
The talks will see the two leaders discuss “the current state and prospects for development of Russian-US relations,” according to the release.
A statement from the White House said the men would also broach “a range of national security issues”.
Trump’s national security advisor John Bolton met Putin in Moscow yesterday. The two discussed the details of the first full summit between the presidents.
US-Russian relations have hit lows not seen since the Cold War over Moscow’s annexation of Crimea, its involvement in eastern Ukraine and allegations of political meddling, as well as disagreement over the Syrian conflict.
Since coming to power last year, Trump has sought to improve relations with Putin amid tensions between Moscow and the West.
Trump said this month that Russia should be re-admitted to the G7 group of industrialised democracies from which it was suspended after annexing Crimea in 2014.

That comment came at a summit which ended in sharp disagreement between Trump and his G7 allies.
The last, brief meeting between Putin and Trump took place in November 2017 in Vietnam during an APEC summit.
Trump is due to attend the July 11 and 12 NATO summit in Brussels before heading to Britain to meet with Prime Minister Theresa May and Queen Elizabeth II on July 13.

Today, the media firm TV3 Group rebranded to Virgin Media Television. That means that channels TV3, 3e and be3 will be renamed as Virgin Media One, Virgin Media Two and Virgin Media Three.
As part of the announcement, the television brand has also revealed it will launch a new channel – Virgin Media Sport – that will be available to Virgin Media customers and air its range of sports content.
In recent years, TV3 Group has undertaken a major push into the sports content sector and acquired the rights for a number of high-profile tournaments and competitions.
Three years ago, the broadcaster secured the rights to air the Six Nations from 2018 to 2021, which ended RTÉ’s long association with the rugby tournament.
Earlier this year, Virgin Media also bagged a four-year agreement with European Professional Club Rugby to broadcast live Champions Cup games from next season.
Last month, it also signed a new rights deal for Uefa Champions League and Europa League matches from next season, which included 327 exclusive matches and the finals of both competitions.
The new deal means the Dublin-based broadcaster has exclusive Irish rights to all Wednesday Champions League matches and all Thursday Europa League ties. However, it will share the rights to 16 Tuesday night Champions League matches with RTÉ.

There could be further opportunity for the new Virgin Media Television group to add more sports rights to its new channel after Setanta Sports co-founder Mickey O’Rourke secured a deal to broadcast 53 live English Premier League games in Ireland from August 2019.

It is understood O’Rourke still has no platform to air the Premier League matches he acquired in the Republic, the majority of which are Saturday afternoon kick offs.
Rebrand
TV3 joined the Virgin Media empire in 2015 when it was acquired by UPC Ireland in a deal worth up to €87 million. UPC became part of Liberty Global’s UK subsidiary, Virgin Media, the previous year and has since rebranded to Virgin Media in Ireland.
Since the acquisition of the TV3 Group, Virgin Media has expanded the network and added a new channel to it roster through the acquisition of UTV Ireland in 2016 for €10 million.
The launch of the new dedicated sports channel has been made in tandem with the group’s planned rebrand to Virgin Media Television.
The three channels part of the TV3 brand currently will be renamed from TV3, 3e and Be3 to Virgin Media One, Two and Three.
The firm announced the rebrand at the beginning of the year. TV3 Group managing director Pat Kiely told reporters that the “very significant rebrand” would take place within the first half of the year.

“Europe has many challenges but migration could end up determining Europe’s destiny,” she told German lawmakers.
The path the EU chooses could decide if the bloc is viewed by others as a credible defender of the values it espouses, she said.
Europe can decide to “overcome the challenge in a way that people in Africa or elsewhere believe that we are guided by our values and that we take a multilateral rather than a unilateral approach,” Merkel added.
The alternative would result in a situation where “no one will believe in our value system that has made us so strong.”
“That’s why the stakes are high,” said the German leader, who is also battling a domestic rebellion over her decision in 2015 to open Germany’s borders to asylum seekers fleeing war and misery in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere.
If a deal cannot be reached between all 28 of the bloc, Merkel said that a compromise must be found among “a coalition of the willing”.
But the guiding principle of any accord must be multilateral and must not put disproportionate weight on frontline countries, she stressed.
“Certainly that’s not a perfect solution, but it’s a start toward better control and order” of the migration problem, she said.
The stakes for Merkel are particularly high, as her Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has given her an ultimatum to find a solution at Thursday and Friday’s summit to curb new arrivals, failing which he would defy her and turn away migrants at the border.

If Seehofer carries through with his threat, it could spell the end of Merkel’s coalition with his CSU party.

1253,196,"Panda conservation is worth billions of dollars a year",https://www.thejournal.ie/china-preservation-worth-billions-4086842-Jun2018/,"PANDA CONSERVATION IS often criticised because of the associated cost, but a new analysis says that it is actually worth billions of dollars.
The analysis, reported in Current Biology on June 28 shows that panda conservation has a value that goes beyond protection of pandas themselves.
The new findings say that the panda’s protection as an umbrella species yields 10 to 27 times as much value as it costs to maintain the current reserves. They also suggest it might be worth expanding those panda reserves and other investments.
China rents pandas to other countries at a cost of about $1 million a panda, and the research is Chinese-based. “Many detractors have argued that spending valuable resources on panda conservation is wasteful,” says Fuwen Wei of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Our analysis contradicts this view and demonstrates clearly the great value of the panda, both for its cultural and intrinsic value and for the ecosystem services provided by panda reserves.
Between 1990 and 2010, China’s National Conservation Project for the Giant Panda and Its Habitat (NCPGPH) doubled panda habitat.
And by 2010, a total of 67 panda reserves with an area of more than 33,000 km2 had been established, which covered more than half of suitable panda habitat.
What’s it worth?
The new study questioned what was that worth. Wei and colleagues used the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services framework.
Ecosystem services include three parts: provisioning services, regulatory services, and culture.
According to the study, panda reserves offer a variety of provisioning services that are valued by local people – these include growing crops, grazing animals, procuring water supplies, and harvesting firewood and useful plants.
The regulatory services include the benefits of managing precipitated water runoff, sediment retention, carbon sequestration, nutrient retention, and more.
The researchers reviewed each of the regulating, provisioning, and cultural services associated with panda reserves, and collated estimates of the value of each from numerous studies.
Then, they converted those estimates to US dollars and used the median value for each to generate a combined estimate of the annual per-hectare value of panda reserves.
Through this, they found a median estimate of US$632 per hectare per year.

SUPPORT US NOW
Next, they multiplied that per hectare per year value by estimates of forest area within the 67 panda reserves – and came to a value of US$562 million per year in 1980.
By 2010, the value of ecosystem services of the panda and its reserves had increased to somewhere between US$2.6 and US$6.9 billion per year.
“Now, we know that the system of reserves and protections [for pandas] are working to reverse the panda’s decline and that these efforts have benefits for society and nature at large,” Wei says.
This should provide added motivation for people to continue backing panda conservation to bring about the eventual recovery of the species.
The researchers say that this news provides justification not just for efforts to preserve the panda, but for other endangered species as well.
However, this is not necessarily news that will be welcomed in all quarters, with some environmentalists and conservations – such as Chris Packham – being opposed to the conservation of pandas.","A new study looked at pandas and their reserves, and compared them in 1980 to today.",127,0,1,15566,"Jun 28th 2018, 11:01 AM"

SENATOR AND FORMER presidential candidate David Norris has launched a blistering  attack on those who would let President Michael D Higgins run unopposed for a second term.
Norris threw his hat in the ring against President Higgins in the 2011 election.
Speaking in the Seanad, Norris suggested that the president’s age (he turned 77 in April) is an issue, but one that people are afraid to raise.
“With the best will in the world, do you want a president who’ll be 85 in the last year?” he said.
Because, forget about ageism, it’s the truth.
On Tuesday, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin confirmed that his party would support Higgins’s candidacy should he seek a second seven-year term.
A consistent source of debate in recent times given the imminent end of his first term, Higgins has said that he will announce whether he will run for a second term in office in July.
‘Courage and guts’
The Irish Times reported last weekend that he had recently informed senior government figures of his intention to seek a second term in office.
The President can nominate himself for re-election; challengers however need the backing of either 20 TDs or senators, or four councils to contest the race.

“I’m fed up listening to people say ‘I’d go only for Michael D’,” he said.
Why the hell don’t you have the courage and the guts to run? I ran, I was a great friend and colleague of Michael D.

Brian Cody’s side may have won four of the last five meetings between the sides, but most recently Galway outclassed the 36-time Liam MacCarthy winners in an eight-point waltz to victory at Pearse Stadium.
Kilkenny only scored two points from play that day, and as Galway seek back-to-back Leinster titles for the first time in their history, confidence is soaring out west.
The sides face off in the final for the third time in four years in Croke Park this Sunday (4pm), but Galway have only beaten Kilkenny in one Leinster final: their first win in the province, back in 2012.

While Galway’s unbeaten championship run continues, they did lose to Limerick and Wexford in this year’s national league. Without a Walsh Cup to wind up his team’s preparation, it was inevitable that Donoghue’s Galway would struggle to hit the heights of 2017 in the spring.
But despite those losses Burke says the side have been filled with confidence after their victories to date in the championship, and that having Liam MacCarthy in the county has also added a layer of armour to their self belief.

“It gives you more confidence. It gives all the players more confidence, definitely. You can see lads are playing probably better than they were last year – some players, and some players aren’t.
“You’ll have that all the time. There’s pressures on players, no matter what. There’s pressure on a team, it doesn’t matter if they’re All-Ireland champions or the worst team in it. There’s pressure on them to deliver, and that comes from within the county itself.

“Look, we’re a hurling stronghold so there’s going to be pressure all the time. So we just have to believe that we’re good enough to be at the top table all the time.”
Despite being crowned league champions with victory over Tipperary, Kilkenny are still being regarded as a team in transition. Cody has introduced new faces in the last two seasons and he will be delighted with the impact of his recent U21 graduates. Burke, too, has been impressed with Kilkenny’s next generation, and warned against expecting another facile victory.

“Look, to be honest, everyone was kind of writing Kilkenny off last year, because they’d young lads coming through. But I knew those lads very well and I was saying they’re very good hurlers and when they get going they’ll be a serious team – and they are a serious team now.
“They’ve won the league against the odds, and only for a blip or two in the championship and everyone is hammering them. So, look, they’ll have their homework done, they’ll have time to recover, so I think they’ll be a different, formidable opposition again the next day. So we just have to be ready for that.
“I think we were always able to beat them on a given day. I think it’s just belief and mindset really, to be honest.
“That’s what probably (made the difference), they had greater belief and mindset over any other team. I think that’s what they’ve instilled into themselves, more than skill or anything itself. They’ve massive belief in winning games and getting over the line.
“I think it comes down to the last 10-15 minutes; I think it will come down to that again the next day against them.
“It’s a Leinster final, there’s a trophy on offer and we’re looking to win it, simple as that.”
